abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Certificates in the Web's X.509 PKI (PKIX) are used for a number
    of\n   purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of\n   domain
    names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are\n   trusted to verify
    that an applicant for a certificate legitimately\n   represents the domain name(s)
    in the certificate.  Today, this\n   verification is done through a collection
    of ad hoc mechanisms.  This\n   document describes a protocol that a certificate
    authority (CA) and\n   an applicant can use to automate the process of verification
    and\n   certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for\n   other
    certificate management functions, such as certificate\n   revocation.\n\n   DANGER:
    Do not implement this specification.  It has a known\n   signature reuse vulnerability.
    \ For details, see the following\n   discussion:\n\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/acme/F71iz6qq1o_QPVhJCV4dqWf-\n
