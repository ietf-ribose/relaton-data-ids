abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a basic transparency requirement for Internet firewalls.
    While such a requirement may seem obvious, the fact of the matter is that firewall
    behavior is currently either unspecified or underspecified, and this lack of specificity
    often causes problems in practice. This requirement is intended to be a necessary
    first step in making the behavior of firewalls more consistent and correct.</p>"
