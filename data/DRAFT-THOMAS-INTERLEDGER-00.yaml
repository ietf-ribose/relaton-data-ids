abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Interledger Protocol (ILP).  It
    draws\n   heavily from the definition of the Internet Protocol (IP) defined in\n
    \  [RFC0791].  The interledger protocol is the culmination of more than\n   a
    decade of research in decentralized payment protocols.  This work\n   was started
    in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, augmented by the development of\n   Bitcoin in 2008 and
    has involved numerous contributors since then.\n\nFeedback\n\n   This specification
    is a part of the Interledger Project [1] work.\n   Feedback related to this specification
    should be sent to public-\n   interledger@w3.org [2].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
