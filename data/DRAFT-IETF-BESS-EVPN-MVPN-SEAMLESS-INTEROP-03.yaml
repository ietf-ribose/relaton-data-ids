abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n
    \  pervasive for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center
    (DC) networks and as the next generation VPN services in\n   service provider
    (SP) networks.\n\n   As service providers transform their networks in their Central\n
    \  Offices (COs) towards the next generation data center with Software\n   Defined
    Networking (SDN) based fabric and Network Function\n   Virtualization (NFV), they
    want to be able to maintain their offered\n   services including Multicast VPN
    (MVPN) service between their\n   existing network and their new Service Provider
    Data Center (SPDC)\n   network seamlessly without the use of gateway devices.
    \ They want to\n   have such seamless interoperability between their new SPDCs
    and their\n   existing networks for a) reducing cost, b) having optimum forwarding,\n
    \  and c) reducing provisioning.  This document describes a unified\n   solution
    based on RFCs 6513 &amp; 6514 for seamless interoperability of\n   Multicast VPN
    between EVPN and MVPN PEs.  Furthermore, it describes\n   how the proposed solution
    can be used as a routed multicast solution\n   in data centers with only EVPN
    PEs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
