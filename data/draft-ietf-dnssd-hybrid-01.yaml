abstract:
- content: "<p>Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local Multicast
    DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local link, but not (without
    some kind of proxy or similar special support) discovery of services that are
    outside the local link. Using a very large local link with thousands of hosts
    facilitates service discovery, but at the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.
    Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is more efficient
    and doesn't require excessively large multicast domains, but requires that the
    relevant data be available in the Unicast DNS namespace. This can be achieved
    by manual DNS configuration (as has been done for many years at IETF meetings
    to advertise the IETF Terminal Room printer) but this is labor intensive, error
    prone, and requires a reasonable degree of DNS expertise. The Unicast DNS namespace
    can be populated with the required data automatically by the devices themselves,
    but that requires configuration of DNS Update keys on the devices offering the
    services, which has proven onerous and impractical for simple devices like printers
    and network cameras. Hence a compromise is needed, that combines the ease-of-use
    of Multicast DNS with the efficiency and scalability of Unicast DNS.</p>"
