abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 has some interesting differences if compared to IPv4. Among
    the \nothers, it has been developed to restore the end-to-end transparency \nof
    the Internet, it offers effective functionalities to support end-\nnodes configuration
    phases, and it offers many features that are \nimplemented in IPv4 as add-ons.
    With such a foundation, IPv6 appears \nas an ideal playground for developing Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) applications \nthat rely by design on the interaction between end nodes.
    \ \n\nThe purpose of this document is to attract participation within the \nP2Pv6
    research group, in order to establish a coordinated and \nproficient research
    about the joint usage of p2p frameworks and the \nIPv6 protocol.  \n\n\t </p>\n
