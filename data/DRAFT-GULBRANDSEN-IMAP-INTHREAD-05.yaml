abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command
    to\n operate on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands\n which
    search are implicitly extended.\n\n The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading
    algorithm using\n (almost) only the References header field for use with the IMAP\n
    THREAD command.\n\t </p>\n      "
