abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Threshold signature scheme is described.  The signatures
    created\n   are computationally indistinguishable from those produced using the\n
    \  Ed25519 and Ed448 curves as specified in RFC8032 except in that they\n   are
    non-deterministic.  Threshold signatures are a form of digital\n   signature whose
    creation requires two or more parties to interact but\n   does not disclose the
    number or identities of the parties involved.\n\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/\n
    \  (http://whatever)Discussion of this draft should take place on the\n   CFRG
    mailing list (cfrg@irtf.org), which is archived at .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
