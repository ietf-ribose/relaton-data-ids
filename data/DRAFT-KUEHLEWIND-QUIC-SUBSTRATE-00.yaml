abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP is often used as a proxying or tunneling protocol.  QUIC
    is a\n   new, emerging transport protocol and there is a similar expectation\n
    \  that it too will be used as a substrate once it is widely deployed.\n   Using
    QUIC instead of TCP in existing scenarios will allow proxying\n   and tunneling
    services to maintain the benefits of QUIC natively,\n   without degrading the
    performance and security characteristics.  QUIC\n   also opens up new opportunities
    for these services to have lower\n   latency and better multistreaming support.
    \ This document summarizes\n   current and future usage scenarios to derive requirements
    for QUIC\n   and to provide additional protocol considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
