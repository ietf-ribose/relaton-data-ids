abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)\n
    \  requirement of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to\n   measure
    the throughput (i.e. bandwidth) of an MPLS-TP connection\n   which could be an
    MPLS-TP PseudoWire (PW), Label Switched Path (LSP)\n   or Section.  This document
    specifies the OAM packet formats and\n   procedures for both one-way and two-way
    throughput measurement in\n   MPLS-TP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
