abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators define their BGP policies based on the business\n
    \  relationships that they maintain with their peers.  By limiting the\n   propagation
    of BGP prefixes, an autonomous system avoids the\n   existence of flows between
    BGP peers that do not provide any\n   economical gain.  This draft describes how
    undesired flows can emerge\n   in autonomous systems due to the filtering of overlapping
    BGP\n   prefixes by neighboring domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
