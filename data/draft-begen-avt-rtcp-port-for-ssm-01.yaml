abstract:
  content: <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allowsRTP
    applications to specify an address and a port associated with theRTP Control Protocol
    (RTCP) traffic. In RTP-based source-specificmulticast (SSM) sessions, the same
    attribute is used to designate theaddress and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target
    in the SDPdescription. However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM sessionitself
    cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,and thus, is required
    to be derived from the "m=" line of the mediadescription. Similarly, in any-source
    multicast (ASM) sessions,there is no explicit way to specify the destination RTCP
    port.Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an unnecessaryrestriction.
    This document removes this restriction by introducing anew SDP attribute.</p>
