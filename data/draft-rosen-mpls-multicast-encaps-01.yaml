abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 3032 established two data link layer codepoints for MPLS: one to
    indicate that the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS unicast packet, and
    the other to indicate that the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS multicast
    packet. This specification updates RFC3032 by redefining the meaning of these
    two codepoints. The former "multicast codepoint" is now to be used only on multiaccess
    media, and it is to mean "the top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned
    label". The former "unicast codepoint" is to be used in all other cases. Whether
    the data link layer payload is a unicast MPLS packet or a multicast MPLS packet
    is now to be determined by looking up the top label, rather than by the codepoint.
    RFC3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the "MAC DA"
    field of an ethernet frame which carries an MPLS multicast packet. This document
    provides that specification. This document updates RFC 3032 and RFC 4023.</p>'
