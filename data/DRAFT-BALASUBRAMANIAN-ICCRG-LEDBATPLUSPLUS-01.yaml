abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This experimental memo describes LEDBAT++, a set of enhancements
    to\n   the LEDBAT (Low Extra Delay Background Transport) congestion control\n
    \  algorithm for background traffic.  The LEDBAT congestion control\n   algorithm
    has several shortcomings that prevent it from working\n   effectively in practice.
    \ LEDBAT++ extends LEDBAT by adding a set of\n   improvements, including reduced
    congestion window gain, modified\n   slow-start, multiplicative decrease and periodic
    slowdowns.  This set\n   of improvement mitigates the known issues with the LEDBAT
    algorithm,\n   such as latency drift, latecomer advantage and inter-LEDBAT fairness.\n
    \  LEDBAT++ has been implemented as a TCP congestion control algorithm\n   in
    the Windows operating system.  LEDBAT++ has been deployed in\n   production at
    scale on a variety of networks and been experimentally\n   verified to achieve
    the original stated goals of LEDBAT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
