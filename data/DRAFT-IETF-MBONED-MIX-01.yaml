abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architecture for a Multicast-friendly\nInternet
    eXchange (MIX), and the actual implementation at the NASA\nAmes Research Center
    Federal Internet eXchange (FIX-West, or FIX).\nThe MIX has three objectives: native
    IP multicast routing, scalable\ninterdomain policy-based route exchange, and to
    allow a variety of\nIGP protocols and topologies for intra-domain use. In support
    of\nthese objectives, the MIX architecture defines the following\ncomponents:
    a peer-peer routing protocol, a method for multicast\nforwarding, a method for
    exchanging information about active sources,\nand a medium which provides native
    multicast.  This document\ndescribes the protocols and configurations necessary
    to provide a\ncurrent, working multicast-friendly internet exchange, or MIX.\nThis
    memo is a product of the MBONE Deployment Working Group (MBONED)\nin the Operations
    and Management Area of the Internet Engineering\nTask Force. Submit comments to
    &lt;mboned@ns.uoregon.edu or the\nauthors.\n\t </p>\n      "
