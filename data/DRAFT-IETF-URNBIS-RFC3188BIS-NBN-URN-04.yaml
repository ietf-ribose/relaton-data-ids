abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are used by the national\n
    \  libraries and other organizations in order to identify various\n   resources
    such as digitized monographs.  Generally, NBNs are applied\n   to resources that
    do not have an established (standard) identifier\n   system of their own.\n\n
    \  A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs was established in\n   2001
    in RFC 3188.  Since then, several European national libraries\n   have implemented
    URN:NBN-based systems.\n\n   This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs
    can be supported\n   within the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration\n
    \  (version 4) compliant to the RFC 3406bis draft is included.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
