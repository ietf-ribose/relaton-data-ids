abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF is a link-state IP interior routing protocol specified
    in [1].\n   Several different extensions to OSPF have been proposed [2,3,5] to\n
    \  support Traffic Engineering [4] and Quality of Service routing [5].\n   This
    document acknowledges all of this earlier work and proposes that\n   a single
    style of protocol encoding be used for all of the parameters\n   involved.\n \n
    \  This document employs the OSPF Opaque LSA Option [6] and the TVLV\n   mechanism
    proposed in [3] to encode additional parameters describing\n   information about
    the state of an OSPF network.  This additional\n   information is useful for Traffic
    Engineering and QoS-based routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
