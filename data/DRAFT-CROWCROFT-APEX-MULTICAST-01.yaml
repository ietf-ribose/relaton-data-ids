abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is a memo that presents an approach to do application layer\nmulticast.
    \ Our intention is to present a design that produces a tree\ndistribution structure
    within the existing design structure of APEX\nand BEEP. It is not our intention
    to present a design that replaces\nmulticast at the network layer. Where the need
    exists (and in\nscenarios where it would seem symbiotic), we would find it\nconstructive
    to integrate the two technologies and perspective (i.e.,\napplication later and
    network layer multicast).\n\t </p>\n      "
