abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on periodic multicast Router\n
    \  Advertisement messages to update timer values and to distribute new\n   information
    (such as new prefixes) to hosts.  On some links the use\n   of periodic multicast
    messages to all host becomes expensive, and in\n   some cases it results in hosts
    waking up frequently.  Many\n   implementations of RFC 4861 also use multicast
    for solicited Router\n   Advertisement messages, even though that behavior is
    optional.\n\n   This specification provides an optional mechanism for hosts and\n
    \  routers where instead of periodic multicast Router Advertisements the\n   hosts
    are instructed (by the routers) to use Router Solicitations to\n   request refreshed
    Router Advertisements.  This mechanism is enabled\n   by configuring the router
    to include a new option in the Router\n   Advertisement in order to allow the
    network administrator to choose\n   host behavior based on whether periodic multicast
    are more efficient\n   on their link or not.  The routers can also tell whether
    the hosts\n   are capable of the new behavior through a new flag in the Router\n
    \  Solicitations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
