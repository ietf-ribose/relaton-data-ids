abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been designed as a generalpurpose
    protocol for establishing and managing multimedia sessions.It provides many core
    functions and extensions in support of featuressuch as transferring of calls,
    parking calls, and so on. However,interoperability of more advanced features between
    different vendorshas been poor. This document describes the reason behind theseinteroperability
    problems, and presents a framework for addressingthem.</p>"
