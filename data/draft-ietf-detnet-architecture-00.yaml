abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry specified
    unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low
    data loss rates and bounded latency. Techniques used include: 1) reserving data
    plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of
    the intermediate nodes (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow; 2)
    providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the
    network topology; and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time
    and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data' in spite of the loss of
    a path. The capabilities can be managed by configuration, or by manual or automatic
    network management.</p>"
