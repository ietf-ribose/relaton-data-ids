abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each
    service to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy, etc.), and
    specifies what actions are to be taken by a submission server. Message relay is
    unaffected, and continues to use SMTP over port 25. When conforming to this document,
    message submission uses the protocol specified here, normally over port 587. This
    separation of function offers a number of benefits, including the ability to apply
    specific security or policy requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
