abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an encrypted
    session between peers that share a traffic secret, such as that which is derived
    from [CCNxKE]. The peers create an outer naming context to identify the encryption
    session in one direction between the consumer and the producer. The consumer sends
    encrypted Interest messages to the producer, who responds with encrypted Content
    Objects. Inside the outer context, the consumer sends Interests with different
    names, which the producer may respond to or may send InterestReturns for. There
    does not need to be a naming relationship between the outer names and the inner
    names. The inner content is still protected by normal CCNx authentication mechanisms
    and possiby encrypted under other schemes.</p>"
