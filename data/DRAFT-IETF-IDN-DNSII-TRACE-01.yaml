abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document, while sharing a similar concept, is an overhaul
    of \nTRACE-00 and describes a strategy for domain name server operators to \nprepare
    and transition their services for multilingual domain names \n(IDN â€“ Internationalized
    Domain Names). \nThe TRACE-01 or IDNX (IDN Transition) approach accepts that users
    \nwith non-IDN aware applications will be attempting to access \nmultilingual
    domain names.  Hence it is the registry or domain \noperator's responsibility
    to provide an IDN solution that resolves \nthese issues to make it a seamless
    transition experience for \ntechnically unsophisticated users. \nIn essence, the
    IDNX approach embraces a complementary server-side \nimplementation to smooth
    the transition.  IDNX ready domain servers \nshould be backward compatible, and
    successfully resolve IDN requests \nsent via non-IDN aware applications, whether
    they are formatted in \nlocal encoding, UTF-8 or an identifiable variant; as well
    as forward \ncompatible, and be able to resolve ACE requests.\n\t </p>\n      "
