abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), use of a random
    interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy. If there are
    a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in several use cases, the
    effect will to proportionately increase the number of IIDs. A duplicate address
    detection (DAD cycle) is needed for each configured IID, introducing more and
    more overhead into the network. Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to
    regenerate a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again. This document proposes an
    optimized approach that requires 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique
    IID, avoiding the potential duplication.</p>"
