abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the metadata schema used to define the
    route\n   exchange policies of an IP VPN network.  Information elements\n   conforming
    to this schema can be distributed using the IF-MAP [if-\n   map] specification.
    \ The schema is applicable both to the standard\n   BGP IP VPN [RFC4364] deployments
    within service provider environments\n   as well as end-system [I-D.marques-l3vpn-end-system]
    based\n   deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
