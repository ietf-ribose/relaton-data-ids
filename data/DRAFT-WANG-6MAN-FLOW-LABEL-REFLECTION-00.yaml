abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current definition of the IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly
    on how\n   the packet source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder\n
    \  in-path treats it.  In network operations, there are needs to\n   correlate
    an upstream session and the corresponding downstream\n   session together.  This
    document propose a flow label reflection\n   mechanism that network devices copy
    the flow label value from\n   received packets to the corresponding flow label
    field in return\n   packets.  This mechanism could simplify the network traffic\n
    \  recognition process in network operations and make the policy for\n   both
    directions of traffic of one session consistent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
