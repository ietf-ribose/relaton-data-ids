abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building
    protocol. The Multicast packet is encapsulated using a BIER Header and transported
    through an MPLS or non-MPLS network. When MPLS is used as the transport, the Bit
    Indexed Forwarding Table (BIFT) is identified by a MPLS Label. When non-MPLS transport
    is used, the BIFT is identified by a 20bit value. This document describes one
    way of encoding the 20bit value.</p>
