abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In PIM-SM networks PIM registers are sent from the first hop
    router\n   to the RP (Rendezvous Point) to signal the presence of Multicast\n
    \  source in the network.  There are periodic PIM Null registers sent\n   from
    first hop router to the RP to keep the state alive at the RP as\n   long as the
    source is active.  The PIM Null register packet carries\n   information about
    a single Multicast source and group.  This document\n   defines a standard to
    send multiple Multicast source and group\n   information in a single pim Null
    register packet and the\n   interoperability between the PIM routers which do
    not understand the\n   packet format with multiple Multicast source and group
    details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
