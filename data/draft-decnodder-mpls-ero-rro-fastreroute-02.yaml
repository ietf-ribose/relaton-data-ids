abstract:
  content: "<p>MPLS fast reroute [3] is considered as a possible solution to protecttraffic
    against link and node failures by re-directing the trafficlocally to a backup
    LSP. A backup LSP can be either a detour LSP or abypass tunnel. This document
    describes two methods to optimize therouting of detour LSPs such that they merge
    faster, a distributedmethod and a centralized method. The distributed method uses
    theBackup Record Route Object (BRRO) and the centralized method uses theBackup
    Explicit Route Object (BERO). The latter can also be used forbypass tunnels.</p>"
