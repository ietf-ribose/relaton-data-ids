abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
    is used to\n   convey path computation requests and responses both between Path\n
    \  Computation Clients (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and\n   between
    cooperating PCEs.  In PCEP, the path computation requests\n   carry details of
    the constraints and objective functions that the PCC\n   wishes the PCE to apply
    in its computation.\n\n   This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific
    information\n   in PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable
    that\n   can be carried in any existing PCEP object.\n\n   This document obsoletes
    RFC 7150.  The only change from that document\n   is the allocation of a different
    code point for the\n   VENDOR-INFORMATION object.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
