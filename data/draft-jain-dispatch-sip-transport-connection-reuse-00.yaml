abstract:
  content: "<p>The current Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification dictatesthat
    a transport layer connection can carry SIP requests in only onedirection i.e.
    from the client to the server. This presentsscalability problems as twice the
    number of connections are neededfor each pair of SIP entities that communicate
    with each other. Theinternet-draft [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse] specifies a mechanism
    forreusing SIP over TLS connections. However, that document ispredicated on secure
    TLS mutual authentication and specificallyrefrains connection reuse for transports
    such as SIP over TCP andSCTP. There are many situations, such as in Trust Domains
    [RFC3324],where TLS mutual authentication may not be required but whereconnection
    reuse is beneficial. This document specifies connectionreuse for SIP over connection-oriented
    transports such as TCP andSCTP. It specifies the same mechanism for connection
    reuse asspecified in [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse], however, the solution ispresented
    in the context of Trust Domains.</p>"
