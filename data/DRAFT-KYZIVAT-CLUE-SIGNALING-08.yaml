abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how CLUE-specific signaling such as
    the CLUE\n   protocol [I-D.presta-clue-protocol] and the CLUE data channel\n   [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel]
    are used with each other and with\n   existing signaling mechanisms such as SIP
    and SDP to produce a\n   telepresence call.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
