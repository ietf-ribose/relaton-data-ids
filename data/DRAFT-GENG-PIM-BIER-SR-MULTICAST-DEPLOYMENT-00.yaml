abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) introduces a stateless\n
    \  multicast approach for a specific IGP area.  Segment Routing\n   introduces
    an approach for end-to-end stateless deployment for both\n   inter-area and inter-as
    scenarios.  This document proposes a MVPN\n   using Segment Routing and BIER for
    a high reachability multicast\n   deployment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
