abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The VIEW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]\npermits
    a subset of messages in the mailbox to be processed\nseparately from the entire
    set of messages in the mailbox.  This\nallows a client to restrict its view to
    only the messages appearing\nin this set.  The subset of messages also need not
    be returned in\norder of their sequence numbers, allowing clients to access messages\nin
    a particular sort order.\nThe subsetting and sorting of messages is handled by
    existing\n[IMAP4] commands that return a set of messages as their result.\nThis
    extension takes the set returned from such a command and\napplies the VIEW methodology
    to it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
