abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proactive Routing Network (PRN), which runs on conventional\n
    \  network, is user and service experience oriented; and provides a\n   set of
    E2E Pipes for the two End Systems of communication named\n   Requester and Source.
    The E2E Pipe have deterministic path learned\n   from the trace of the Request
    sent by Requester, and is QOS\n   guaranteed by resource reservation. Addressing
    issue is solved by\n   recording the labeled interfaces or Local Pipes taken along
    with\n   the Request to the Source. Each Pipe is protocol oblivious,\n   application
    aware, elastic and visible for users and operators.\n\n   PRN is not a new network,
    rather, it is a service attached to the\n   conventional network. Therefore it
    does not affect the operation\n   business of the conventional networks, so it
    is very conducive to\n   the deployment and smooth evolution.\n\n   PRN is valuable
    for users who want deterministic network service,\n   and is helpful for operators
    to simplify the service management\n   and easy for fault location and billing,
    and is helpful for\n   vendors to solve the addressing issue which is one of the
    biggest\n   challenges of increasing device throughput at a reasonable cost.\n\n\t
