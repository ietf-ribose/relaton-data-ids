abstract:
- content: "<p>Graceful Insertion and Removal (GIR) of routers is often adopted by
    many network administrators as an alternative to ISSU. This document discusses
    various scenarios, requirements and possible solutions to make PIM gracefully
    shut down and isolate the multicast router with minimal network disruption when
    a router goes through maintenance procedures.</p>"
