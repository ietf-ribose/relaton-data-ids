abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The concept of node identifier, in practical terms an IP address,
    is \ncrucial in ad hoc networks. Its use allows the setup of IP routing \nfor
    ad hoc connectivity and the identification of several wireless \ndevices as part
    of a unique ad hoc node. In this document, a new \naddressable object is defined:
    the ad hoc connector. It virtualizes \nseveral ad hoc network interfaces into
    a single addressable object. \nTo locally address ad hoc connectors, a third IPv6
    local-use unicast \naddress (adhoc-local address) and the correlated use of the
    subnet \nmulticast scope are defined. \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
