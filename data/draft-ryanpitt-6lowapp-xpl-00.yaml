abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL)
    andXPL Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for buildingprotocols
    in the application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan andproposed 6lowApp Working
    Groups. This comprises applications forhighly resource-constrained devices over
    wireless networks, where thedevices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous; potentially
    very small;heterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%); and areinstalled
    or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricitymeters, electric cars,
    etc.</p>"
