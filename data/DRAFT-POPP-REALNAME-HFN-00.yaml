abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  The notion of a 'Human Friendly Naming scheme' (HFN) has been\n
    \ discussed in a variety of contexts, as an alternative to the use of\n  URIs
    or URNs as a way of designating Internet resources (see [RFC\n  2276], for example).\n
    \n  This document introduces the RealName system, and its use as a\n  HFN. It
    provides a mapping for RealNames into a URN namespace ('rn')\n  as well as a URL
    scheme ('vnd.rn').\n \n  This is a preliminary draft, intended to raise the discussion
    of\n  HFNs and the uses of RealNames as an initial example in creating a\n  standard
    for access and resolution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
