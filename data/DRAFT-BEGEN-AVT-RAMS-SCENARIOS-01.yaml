abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution
    is a\nmethod based on RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables an\nRTP
    receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast\ndata.  Upon
    a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP\nretransmission session
    is set up between a retransmission server and\nthe RTP receiver, over which the
    reference information about the new\nmulticast stream the RTP receiver is about
    to join is transmitted at\nan accelerated rate.  This often precedes, but may
    also accompany,\nthe multicast stream itself.  When there is only one multicast
    stream\nto be acquired, the RAMS solution works in a straightforward manner.\nHowever,
    when there are two or more multicast streams to be acquired\nfrom the same or
    different multicast RTP sessions, care should be\ntaken to configure each RAMS
    session appropriately.  This document\nprovides example scenarios and offers guidelines.\n\t
