abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)  \nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn
    particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management
    of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home\nrouters.  Specifically, this
    MIB defines managed objects for both a\nconnection speed tool and an ICMP 'ping'
    tool between the Gateway and \ndevices on the LAN.\nThis memo specifies a MIB
    module in a manner that is compliant to the\nSNMP SMIv2.  The set of objects is
    consistent with the SNMP\nframework and existing SNMP standards.\n\t </p>\n      "
