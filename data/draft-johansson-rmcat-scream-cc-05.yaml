abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational
    video services. The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and
    uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control algorithm. The algorithm
    is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a
    LTE (Long Term Evolution) system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency
    and high video throughput in these scenarios.</p>"
