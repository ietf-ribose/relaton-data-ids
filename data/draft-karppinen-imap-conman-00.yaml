abstract:
  content: "<p>The IMAP4 [RFC-2060] protocol is based on the client-server paradigmwhere
    a single client is concerned only with the mail of a singleuser. However, due
    to advent of several scenarios where n-tierinteraction is desired, the need has
    arisen to work with severalusers' mail during a single IMAP4 connection.In such
    scenario, a component of a n-tier system may act as an IMAP4client on behalf of
    multiple end-users. Present examples of thisinclude many WWW-based email services.
    Initial profiling suggeststhat persistent IMAP4 connections can lead to a performance
    increaseof an order of magnitude when compared to separate IMAP4 connectionsper
    mailbox action.This document defines an extension to the IMAP4 protocol that allowsa
    persistent connection to be established for accessing the mail ofmultiple users.
    The extension includes a new USERLOGOUT command, anda requirement for a CAPABILITIES
    response from servers implementingthe extension.</p>"
