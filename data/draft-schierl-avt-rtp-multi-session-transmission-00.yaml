abstract:
  content: <p>In this draft, we discuss problems related to multi-session andmulti-source
    transmission using the Real-Time Transport Protocol(RTP). Most of the input to
    this draft is taken from emaildiscussion. Multi-session and multi-source transmission
    is motivatedby media data which allows for different transport layer treatment
    ofparts of the media. This is typically the case for layered media.Multi-session
    transmission is when media data from a single mediasource is split over multiple
    RTP sessions. Single-session multi-source transmission (from now on just called
    "multi-sourcetransmission") is when data from a single media source is sent asseveral
    RTP streams in the same RTP session. The main problemsdiscussed are the mechanisms
    used for data alignment and sourcecorrelation. This draft gives further an overview
    of payload formatsusing multi-sessions/multi-source transmission and highlights
    othertransport related issues. The draft concludes with recommendationsfor the
    discussed problems.</p>
