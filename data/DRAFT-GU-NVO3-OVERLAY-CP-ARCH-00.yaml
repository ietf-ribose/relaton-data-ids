abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Draft [overlay-cp] has introduced some control plan requirements
    and\n   characteristics.  From NVE's perspective, this draft describes what\n
    \  assistance is needed to make NVE satisfy the requirements and\n   characteristics
    introduce in [overlay-cp].  Not all of these\n   assistance is necessarily achieved
    by an external controller.  Some\n   of the assistance requirements can be regarded
    as a complementarity\n   requirements to [overlay-cp] . while others are requirements
    to an\n   assistance Database.  This draft also provide considerations on how\n
    \  the network virtualization architecture should be like and how these\n   assistance
    can be fulfilled.  The target is to help the working group\n   to figure out the
    architecture of overlay control plane, instead of\n   providing solutions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
