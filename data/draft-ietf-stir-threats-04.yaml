abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet and the telephone network have become increasingly
    interconnected and interdependent, attackers can impersonate or obscure calling
    party numbers when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail
    boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.
    This document analyzes threats in the resulting system, enumerating actors, reviewing
    the capabilities available to and used by attackers, and describing scenarios
    in which attacks are launched.</p>"
