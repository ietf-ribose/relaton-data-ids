abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the
    X.509CRL mechanism used to determine if a public-key certificate is valid orrevoked.
    These enhancements provide advantages over existing CRLmechanisms, including those
    that use static CRL partitioning as definedin ISO/IEC 9504-8/ITU-T Rec. X.509.
    In particular, the mechanismsproposed can: (a) reduce the need for unnecessarily
    fetching unchanged CRLs, therebygreatly expanding the value of caching CRLs;(b)
    allow CRL timeliness to be improved;(c) accommodate dynamic partitioning as opposed
    to fixed partitioning;(d) better support use of certificates in multiple environments
    withdifferent CRL stores. This document is submitted for consideration as the
    basis of possiblefuture IETF standardization. Please send comments on this document
    tothe ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.</p>"
