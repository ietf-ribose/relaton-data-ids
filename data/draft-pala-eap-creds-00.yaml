abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
    rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network
    access, the need for a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework
    is paramount. The .1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications,
    etc.) to authenticate to the network by providing a communication channel where
    different methods can be used to exchange different types of credentials. However,
    the need for managing these credentials (i.e., provisioning and renewal) is still
    a hard problem to solve. This specifications define how to support the provisioning
    and management of authentication credentials that can be exploited in different
    environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular, etc.) to users and/or devices by using
    EAP together with standard provisioning protocols.</p>"
