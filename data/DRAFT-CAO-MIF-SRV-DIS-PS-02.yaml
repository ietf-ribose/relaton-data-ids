abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in
    a\n   multiple connection environment.  A multiple connection environment\n   consists
    of multiple-interfaced nodes connecting to multiple networks\n   or multiple provisioning
    domains.  Given a type of service a\n   multiple-interfaced client is looking
    for, the discovery progress\n   ought to return a correct pointer to the service
    instance that the\n   client is able to access without trying every available
    channel.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
