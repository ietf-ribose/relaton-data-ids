abstract:
- content: <p>Until DNSSEC is fully deployed, so-called "islands of trust" will exist.
    This will lead to a large number of keys with no method within DNSSEC to manage
    the keys. This proposal seeks to address that issue using existing mechanisms
    to allow cross-signing of root (i.e. roots of islands) keys. This cross-signing
    of keys creates a non-hierarchical web of trust which permits the efficient gathering
    and validation of trust anchors.</p>
