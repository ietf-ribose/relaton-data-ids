abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DOTS client signal using original signal communication channel
    can\n   expect service degradation and even service disruption as any other\n
    \  service over Internet but in more severe conditions because the\n   signal
    may have to be transmitted over congested paths due to the\n   denial-of-service
    attack.\n\n   This document specifies a fall-back asynchronous mechanism using
    an\n   intermediate agent to store DOTS signal information during a limited\n
    \  period of time.  This mechanism allows a DOTS server to request a\n   signal
    information stored by a DOTS client when no heartbeat is\n   received from the
    DOTS client.  This intermediate agent called DOTS\n   Signal Repository have to
    be connected to the DOTS client and server\n   independently.  The repository
    must be located and/or reached through\n   one or multiple network paths, preferably
    as most as possible\n   disjoint from regular signal channel, in order to increase
    its\n   reachability.  The document introduces a set of support protocols to\n
    \  build the asynchronous communication between the DOTS cient, server\n   and
    the repository.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
