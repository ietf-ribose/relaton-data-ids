abstract:
- content: "<p>The Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) format defines a token that
    can be carried by signaling protocols, including SIP, to cryptographically attest
    the identity of callers. However, not all telephone calls use Internet signaling
    protocols, and some calls use them for only part of their signaling path, while
    some cannot reliably deliver SIP header fields end-to-end. This document describes
    use cases that require the delivery of PASSporT objects outside of the signaling
    path, and defines architectures and semantics to provide this functionality.</p>"
