abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is intended to be a guide for network administrators
    of\nenterprise sized sites that employ the Internet Protocol Version 4\n(IPv4)
    and who would like to introduce the Internet Protocol Version\n6 (IPv6) dual-stack.
    It applies to scenarios where IPv4 subnets must\nbe mapped to IPv6 subnets for
    management purposes while keeping the\noption to create IPv6 subnets in parallel
    and independently in the\nfuture with almost no restrictions; it is not meant
    to be applied to\nscenarios where a native IPv6 address plan can be created easily
    and\nwithout the need to map IPv4 subnets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
