abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol which provides movbility support
    for an ordinary IPv6 host in WiMAX network. The protocol allows session continuity
    for every IPv6 node in WiMAX network as it moves across subnets. The protocol
    exploits the facts that a single prefix is assigned per an IPv6 host in WiMAX
    network and prefix binding scheme is defined in NEMO WG. WiMAX access routers
    perform prefix binding for the hosts' stead and the mobility is transparent to
    the hosts inside WiMAX network.</p>"
