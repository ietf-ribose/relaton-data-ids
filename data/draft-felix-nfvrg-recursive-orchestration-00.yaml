abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a policy-based resource management and orchestration
    framework which aims at contributing towards the current namesake NFVRG near-term
    work items. It describes key points of the recursive resource orchestration framework
    developed within the wider research area of federated virtual network function
    orchestration. The document also relates this effort with respect to other orchestration
    frameworks, thus addressing both the NFV research and practitioner communities.</p>"
