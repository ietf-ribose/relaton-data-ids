abstract:
- content: "<p>To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix mis-
    announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security requirements
    is the ability to validate the origination AS of BGP routes. More specifically,
    one needs to validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix
    (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact authorized
    by the prefix holder to do so. This document describes a simple validation mechanism
    to partially satisfy this requirement.</p>"
