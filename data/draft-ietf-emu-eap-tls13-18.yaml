abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.
    This document specifies the use of EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) with
    TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of
    EAP-TLS. TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security, privacy, and reduced
    latency when compared to earlier versions of TLS. EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS
    1.3) further improves security and privacy by always providing forward secrecy,
    never disclosing the peer identity, and by mandating use of revocation checking.
    This document also provides guidance on authentication, authorization, and resumption
    for EAP-TLS in general (regardless of the underlying TLS version used). This document
    updates RFC 5216.</p>"
