abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Hash Of Root Key certificate extension.\n
    \  This certificate extension is carried in the self-signed certificate\n   for
    a trust anchor, which is often called a Root Certification\n   Authority (CA)
    certificate.  This certificate extension unambiguously\n   identifies the next
    public key that will be used at some point in the\n   future as the next Root
    CA certificate, replacing the current one.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
