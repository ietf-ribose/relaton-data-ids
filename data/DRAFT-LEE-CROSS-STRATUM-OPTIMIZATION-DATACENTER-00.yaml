abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such
    as \nvideo gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used \nto
    provide application services are distributed geographically around \na network,
    many decisions made in the control and management of \napplication services, such
    as where to instantiate another service \ninstance or to which data center out
    of several a new client is \nassigned, can have a significant impact on the state
    of the network. \nConversely the capabilities and state of the network can have
    a major \nimpact on application performance.  \n\nCurrently application decisions
    are made with very little or no \ninformation concerning the underlying network
    used to deliver those \nservices. Hence such decisions may be sub-optimal from
    both \napplication and network resource utilization and quality of service \nobjectives.
    This document proposes a research program into cross \nstratum application/network
    optimization focusing on the challenges \nand opportunities presented by data
    center based applications and \ncarriers networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
