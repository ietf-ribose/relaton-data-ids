abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Preferred Path Routing (PPR) is concerned with setting up the
    route\n   for a given prefix as specified in the path description along with a\n
    \  corresponding data plane/forwarding identifier PPR-ID.  This document\n   specifies
    an extension to PPR, a mechanism to perform resource\n   reservations nodes on
    Preferred Path Routes (PPR) for IGPs (IS-IS,\n   OSPFv2, OSPFv3).  This is done
    by specifying the resources that need\n   to be reserved along the path using
    PPR path attributes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
