abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels
    to\n   be booked in advance.  In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it\n
    \  is assumed to consume a certain amount of resources such as link\n   bandwidth
    forever.\n\n   Temporal LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us
    to\n   book temporal LSP tunnels in advance.  More importantly, a temporal\n   LSP
    is an LSP with one or more time intervals and it is assumed to\n   consume the
    resources and carry traffic only in these time intervals.\n\n   This document
    specifies extensions to PCEP for computing a path for a\n   temporal LSP, initiating
    and maintaining a temporal LSP with a\n   sequence of time intervals, during each
    of which the LSP carries\n   traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
