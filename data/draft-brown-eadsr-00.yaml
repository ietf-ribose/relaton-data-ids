abstract:
  content: "<p>The energy aware dynamic source routing (EADSR) protocol is anextension
    to the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol for mobile adhoc networks. It retains
    the features and benefits of DSR while itincorporates new features for energy
    limited nodes. The EADSRfeatures include (1) a DSR header option so that link
    power costscan be passed with source routes; (2) an extended route discoveryprotocol
    to find lower energy routes than minimum hop routes; and(3) an additional route
    maintenance mechanism that allows the sourcenode to respond to link changes without
    route disruption. Theprotocol is able to find routes with minimum total transmit
    powercost. It is able to track changes in link power on a route, choosebetween
    routes based on cost, and notify the source of new lowercost routes as they become
    available. This document specifies theEADSR header option and operation changes
    to DSR.</p>"
