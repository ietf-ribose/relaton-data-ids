abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of nodes and
    links in segment routing to represent transport/optical networks in an opaque
    way into the segment routing domain. An instance of this class would be optical
    networks that are typically transport centric by having very few devices with
    the capability to process packets. In the IP centric network, this will help in
    defining a common control protocol for packet optical integration that will include
    optical paths as 'transport segments' or sub-paths as an augmentation to packet
    paths. The transport segment option also defines a general mechanism to allow
    for future extensibility of segment routing into non-packet domains.</p>"
