abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document tries to address an approach for reorganization
    of\n   entire network in a large address space. It describes how entire\n   address
    space can be distributed within some regions and sub regions\n   inside each of
    them by establishing mesh structured hierarchy. It\n   addresses issues which
    could be relevant to this architecture in the\n   context of IPv6. This document
    also tries to come out with an\n   approach how IP switch based network can perform
    as good as ATM\n   network for the processing of real time traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n
