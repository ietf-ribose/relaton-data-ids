abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information
    about\n   Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within
    a\n   network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its\n   associated
    Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes\n   general considerations
    for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its\n   applicability and benefits
    through a number of use cases.  Path\n   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions
    required for stateful\n   PCE usage are covered in separate documents.\n\n\t </p>\n
