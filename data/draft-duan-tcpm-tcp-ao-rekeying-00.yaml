abstract:
  content: "\t <t>TCP-AO technology was proposed to obsolete the TCP-MD5 option whichwas
    developed to protect the BGP sessions between routers. Besidesof allowing users
    to choose which cryptographic algorithm(s) theywant to use to meet their security
    needs, TCP-AO provides keycoordination mechanism giving the ability to move from
    one key toanother within the same connection with zero segment loss by usingtwo
    ID fields i.e. KeyID and RNextKeyID. The sender uses theRNextKeyID to indicate
    the receiver using the preferred MKT whichwill authenticate the next incoming
    segments. However, if the senderfinds its MKT which is used to authenticate the
    outgoing segments hasbeen attacked and should be changed into a new one, it can
    do nothingbut wait for receiver to send a segment which carries a differentRNextKeyID.In
    this case, the communication becomes dangerous probably becausethe sender always
    authenticates outgoing segments by an attacked keybefore the receiver wants to
    change the incoming key. This documentprovides a method giving the sender ability
    to inform the other partchange the RNextKeyID when the sender finds the key used
    in outgoingsegment is not safe any longer.</p>"
