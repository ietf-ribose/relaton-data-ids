abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional
    Transport\n   protocol (ROUTE Protocol) is specified for robust delivery of\n
    \  application objects, including application objects with real-time\n   delivery
    constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport.\n   Application objects
    consist of data that has meaning to applications\n   that use the ROUTE Protocol
    for delivery of data to receivers, for\n   example, it can be a file, or a DASH
    or HLS segment, a WAV audio\n   clip, etc. The ROUTE Protocol also supports low-latency
    streaming\n   applications.\n\n   The ROUTE Protocol is suitable for unicast,
    broadcast, and multicast\n   transport. Therefore, it can be run over IP/UDP including
    multicast\n   IP. ROUTE Protocol can leverage the features of the underlying\n
    \  protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security\n   protocols
    such as IPSec.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
