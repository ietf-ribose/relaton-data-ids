abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the procedures required for correct
    operation\n   of a multicast router in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, where\n
    \  some or all of the multicast group and unicast source addresses can\n   be
    translated between IPv4 and IPv6, and where incoming multicast\n   data may need
    to be forwarded into both IPv4 and IPv6 distribution\n   trees.  The router is
    assumed to support Protocol Independent\n   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM, RFC
    4601) in an environment\n   consisting of a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 local hosts
    and PIM peers.\n   The work is easily generalized to other versions of PIM.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
