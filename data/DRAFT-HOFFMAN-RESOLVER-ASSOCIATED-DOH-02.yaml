abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Browsers and web applications may want to know if there are
    one or\n   more DoH servers associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the\n
    \  client is already using.  This would allow them to get DNS responses\n   from
    a resolver that the user (or, more likely, the user's network\n   administrator)
    has already chosen.  This document describes a\n   protocol for a resolver to
    tell a client what its associated DoH\n   servers are.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
