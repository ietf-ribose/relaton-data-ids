abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique
    for\ninter-domain SIP federation.  ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,\nand
    SIP, and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP\nspam problems
    that have been a barrier to federation.  The ViPR\narchitecture uses a server,
    the ViPR server, which performs P2P and\nvalidation services on behalf of call
    agents, which acts as clients\nto the server.  Such an architecture requires a
    client/server\nprotocol between call agents and the ViPR server.  That protocol,\ndefined
    here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents and
