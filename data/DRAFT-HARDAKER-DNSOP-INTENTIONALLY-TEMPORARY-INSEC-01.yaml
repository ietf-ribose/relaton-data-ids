abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Performing DNSKEY algorithm transitions with DNSSEC signing
    is\n   unfortunately challenging to get right in practice without decent\n   tooling
    support.  This document weighs the correct, completely secure\n   way of rolling
    keys against an alternate, significantly simplified,\n   method that takes a zone
    through an insecure state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
