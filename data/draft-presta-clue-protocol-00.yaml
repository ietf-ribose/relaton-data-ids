abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a work-in-progress draft aimed at shedding light on the application-level
    protocol associated with the creation and management of a CLUE-enabled telepresence
    session between a Media Consumer and a Media Provider. The draft sketches the
    high-level interactions occurring between the above mentioned entities, as well
    as depicts the state transitions occurring at both ends during a telepresence
    session.</p>"
