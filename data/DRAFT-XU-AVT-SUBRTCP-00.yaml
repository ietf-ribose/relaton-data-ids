abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes SubRTCP, an extension to RTCP.  SubRTCP\n
    \  operates on the same underlying transport establishement as for RTCP\n   but
    functions independently of the latter.  SubRTCP extends RTCP to\n   the middle
    nodes of an RTP session to allow monitoring of its data\n   delivery also at and
    between these middle nodes.  Such an internal\n   visibility provided by SubRTCP
    at the middle nodes complements the\n   delivery monitoring by RTCP at the endpoints
    particularly in service\n   providers' interest.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
