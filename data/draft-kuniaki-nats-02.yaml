abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks which are using IPv4 addresses are using the address translation
    technologies such as NAT at end-networks for various reasons. However, those technologies
    sometimes prevent two-way transparently communications. This document will define
    a way to enhance address translation technologies such as NAT. This way will be
    able to communicate transparently by adding a sub-address to IPv4. This enhancement
    will be called 'NATS'(Network Address Translation with Sub-Address) in this document.</p>"
