abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability
    to\nsimultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a given\noptical
    network. Optical multi-granularity and particularly waveband\nswitching raises
    some issues for GMPLS. These have been partially\naddressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and
    [GMPLS-SIG] from the CCAMP Working\nGroup. However, enabling multi-granularity
    in optical networks\ndemands the definition of a more complete set of requirements\nconsidering
    the management, control, routing and signaling issues\nand their impacts in the
    GMPLS protocols suite.\n\t </p>\n      "
