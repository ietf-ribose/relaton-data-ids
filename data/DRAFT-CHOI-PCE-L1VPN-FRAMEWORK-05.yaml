abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When path computation is done in the management systems for
    Layer 1\n   Virtual Private Networks (L1 VPNs), it would be important that \n
    \  resource information is synchronized between the management systems \n   and
    the Provider Edge /Provider (PE/P). This draft looks at such a\n   scenario from
    the viewpoint of the Path Computation Element Metric\n   Protocol (PCEMP) that
    acts a generic computation model for path\n   based metrics in large multi-domain
    or multi-layer networks. This \n   draft shows how PCEMP messages might help preserving
    the path \n   computational entities in the L1 VPN peer nodes. \n\n   This draft
    proposes to show how a L1 VPN framework may be included\n   within the scope of
    Path Computation Element architectures and is\n   derived primarily from the motivation
    of per VPN peer service \n   solutions using PCE techniques. PCEMP metrics defining
    path quality \n   measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria
    \n   for L1 VPNs is in line with the functional specifications of \n   Generalized
    Traffic Engineered LSP path computation techniques \n   involving Path Computation
    Element(s) of the PCE WG Charter. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
