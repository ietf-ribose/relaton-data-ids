abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes those features of a service which processes\nsigned
    doucments which must be present in order for that service to\nconstitute a 'technical
    non-repudiation' service.  A technical\nnon-repudiation service must permit an
    independent verifier to\ndetermine whether a given signature was applied to a
    given data object\nby the private key associated with a given valid certificate,
    at a time\nlater than the signature.  The features of a technical non-repudiation\nservice
    are expected to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service,\nalthough they
    may not be sufficient.\nThis document is intended to clarify the definition of
    the\n'non-repudiation' service in RFC 2459.  It should thus serve as a guide\nto
    when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should be used\nand to when
    a Certificate Authority is required to archive CRL's.\n\t </p>\n      "
