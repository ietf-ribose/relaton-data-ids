abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When the 5321.MailFrom domain in an e-mail message has a DNS
    MX\n   Resource Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is\n   willing
    to accept email.  However, when the domain has just a DNS A\n   or AAAA RR, there
    mail clients cannot easily tell whether the domain\n   accepts mail, as many hosts
    on the Internet advertise an A or AAAA RR\n   regardless of whether they want
    to accept email.\n\n   The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which
    a domain\n   announces that it accepts no mail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
