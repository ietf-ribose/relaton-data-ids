abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When both the LDAP client and server reside on the same machine,\n
    \  communication efficiency can be greatly improved using host- specific\n   IPC
    mechanisms instead of a TCP session.  Such mechanisms can also\n   implicitly
    provide the client's identity to the server for extremely\n   lightweight authentication.
    \ This document describes the\n   implementation of LDAP over Unix IPC that has
    been in use in OpenLDAP\n   since January 2000, including the URL format used
    to specify an IPC\n   session.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
