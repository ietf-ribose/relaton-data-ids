abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP
    based\n   access networks.  However, in roaming environments, IP clients might\n
    \  change of gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur.\n   The
    present document describes a solution based on the Context\n   Transfer Protocol
    (CxTP) to enhance IP handover in mobile\n   environments.  This protocol can recover
    the previously established\n   PANA security context from previous PANA Authentication
    Agent.\n\t </p>\n      "
