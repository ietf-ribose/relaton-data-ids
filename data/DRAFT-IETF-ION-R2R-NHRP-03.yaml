abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [1] specifies a\nmechanism
    that allows a source station (e.g., a host or a router) on\nan NBMA subnetwork
    to find the NBMA subnetwork address address of a\ndestination station when the
    destination station is connected to the\nNBMA subnetwork. For the case where the
    destination station is off\nthe NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described in [1]
    allows to\ndetermine the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router from the\nNBMA
    subnetwork that is 'nearest' to the destination station.  If\nused to locate an
    egress router wherein the destination station is\ndirectly behind the egress router,
    the currently document NHRP\nbehaviors are sufficient.  However, as documented
    elsewhere [2],\nthere are cases where if used between routers for generalized\ntransit,
    NHRP can produce loops.\n \nThis document describes extensions to the NBMA Next
    Hop Resolution\nProtocol (NHRP) [1] that allow to acquire and maintain the\ninformation
    about the egress router without constraining the\ndestination(s) to be directly
    connected to the egress router.\n\t </p>\n      "
