abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises fromthe
    desire to treat a set or group of names as \"aliases\" of eachother, \"bundled,\"
    \"variants,\" or \"the same,\" which is problematic interms of corresponding behavior
    for DNS labels.With the emergence of internationalized domain names, among otherpotential
    use cases, two or more names that users will regard ashaving identical meaning
    will sometimes require correspondingbehavior in the DNS. It's not clear how to
    accommodate theserequirements for behavior of such names in DNS resolution; inparticular,
    it's not clear when they are best accommodated inregistry practices for generating
    names for lookup in the DNS,existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, or some
    set of protocolelements or behavior not yet defined. This document attempts todescribe
    some of these cases and the behavior of some of the possiblesolutions discussed
    to date.NOTE: Even more than usual, version -02 of this document is a \"workin
    progress\". Additional updates may be expected between the date ofthis document
    and the DNSEXT meeting in Beijing, and can be found athttp://users.isc.org/~woolf.</p>"
