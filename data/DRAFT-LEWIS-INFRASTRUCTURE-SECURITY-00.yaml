abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This RFC defines best current practices for implementing Service\nProvider
    network infrastructure protection for network elements.\nThis RFC complements
    and extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704.  RFC 2267\nprovides guidelines for filtering
    traffic on the ingress to service\nprovider networks.  RFC 3704 expands the recommendations
    described in\nRFC 2267 to address operational filtering guidelines for single
    and\nmulti-homed environments.  The focus of those RFCs is on filtering\ningress
    packets ingress, regardless of destination, if those packets\nare have spoofed
    source address or fall within \"reserved\" address\nspace.  Deployment of RFCs
    2267 and 3704 has limited the effects of\ndenial of service attacks by dropping
    ingress packets with spoofed\nsource addresses, which in turn offers other benefits
    by ensuring\nthat packets coming into a network originate from validly allocated\nand
    consistent sources.\n\nThis document focuses solely on traffic destined to the
    network\ninfrastructure itself to protect the network from denial of service\nand
    other attacks.  This document presents techniques that, together\nwith network
    edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267 and RFC 3704, create\na layered approach for
    infrastructure protection.\n\nThis document does not present recommendations for
    protocol   validation (i.e. \"sanity checking\") nor does it address guidelines\nfor
    general security configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
