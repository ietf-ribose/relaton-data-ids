abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS labels
    are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, the packet
    header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30
    bytes, for example. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP
    overhead through various compression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed RTP
    (ECRTP). We consider using MPLS to route ECRTP compressed packets over an MPLS
    LSP without compression/decompression cycles at each router. Such an ECRTP over
    MPLS capability can increase the bandwidth efficiency as well as processing scalability
    of the maximum number of simultaneous VoIP flows that use header compression at
    each router.</p>"
