  content: "\n\t <p>The Smart Grid [8] initiative is an effort in modernization of
    the \nelectricity grid using communication technology with the primary \ngoals
    of reducing energy consumption, reducing cost (utilities and \nconsumers), increasing
    reliability and the creation of new services \nfor all participants in the value
    chain. The core focus of this \ninitiative is the specification of a 'Communications
    Overlay' network \nwhich can help facilitate intelligent communication (discovery,
    \nsession establishment, routing, addressing to name a few)  between \nvarious
    nodes of the heterogeneous Smart Grid network. \n \n \n \nRoychowdhury\n\n\n\n
    Expires - April 2010\n\n\n\n\n  [page 1] \n  Motivation for SIP as an application
    protocol for 6lowpan devices\n\n \n \nOne of the 'network segments' of the Smart
    Grid network is the Home \nArea Network (HAN) and how residential and/or commercial
    devices \n(such as TV, washing machine, surveillance camera, etc.) interact \nwith
    the smart meter/energy management system and vice-versa. \n \nThis draft is an
    initial input for consideration of SIP as an \nappropriate application protocol
    for use inside devices that operate \nover low powered IP networks.  \n \nThe
    authors do NOT propose the use of SIP for all HAN devices. \nRather, the authors
    believe that SIP is an appropriate protocol for \ncertain categories of devices
    and therefore, the 6lowapp group should \nconsider SIP as an appropriate protocol
    for the same. The final \nprotocol that is ideal for a particular device communication
    will \nalways be determined by the use-case(s) that are envisioned for the \nsame.
    \n \nThis draft does NOT discuss the use of SIP inside the smart meter \n(while
    the authors believe that the smart meter would also benefit \nfrom SIP, that is
    the scope of another draft and does not apply to \nthe 6lowapp work). Therefore,
    in all diagrams and references, the \nauthors have used the term 'Energy Management
    System (EMS)' to refer \nto the customer premise EMS that may or may not be the
    smart meter \nitself. \n \n \nConventions used in this document \n \nIn examples,
    \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and \nserver respectively.
    \nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this
    \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. \n \nThe term EMS
    refers to the customer premise Energy Management System \nwhich may be the smart
    meter or an adjunct devices that communicates \nwith the utility core network
    for the purposes of energy management \nand billing.\n\t </p>\n      "
