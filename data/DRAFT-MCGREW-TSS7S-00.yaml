abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes the transport of SS7 signalling messages\nover
    IP in a way that utilizes the existing SS7 network (MTP and\nSCCP) layers to ensure
    'carrier class' service as expected by\nexisting users of SS7.  The transport
    of SS7 user information\ncould use TCP connections or UDP. The SS7 signalling
    messages\nwould include ISUP or SCCP or, if the network services are not\nneeded,
    could include only TCAP. Work should begin to define the\nnecessary adaptation
    layers to make these transport methods\npossible.\n\t </p>\n      "
