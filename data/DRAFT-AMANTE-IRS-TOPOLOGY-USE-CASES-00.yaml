abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes use cases for gathering routing, forwarding\n
    \  and policy information, (hereafter referred to as topology\n   information),
    about the network and reflecting changes to the\n   topology back into the network
    and related systems.  It describes\n   several applications that need to view
    or change the topology of the\n   underlying physical or logical network.  This
    document further\n   demonstrates a need for a \"Topology Manager\" and related
    functions\n   that collects topology data from network elements and other data\n
    \  sources, coalesces the collected data into a coherent view of the\n   overall
    network topology, and normalizes the network topology view\n   for use by clients
    -- namely, applications that consume or want to\n   change topology information.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
