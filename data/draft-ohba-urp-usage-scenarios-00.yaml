  content: "\t <t>Many different kinds of commercial networks require users toperform
    registration before being allowed usage toresources. Resources could include basic
    access to the network toresources that are more specific such as services in the
    networkor a certain grade of service, etc. The registration process isnormally
    specific to the type of network that a user is attachingto and the registration
    process itself occurs in the protocollayers that are specific to an access technology.
    With a networklayer (IP) or above solution, a common protocol for performingregistration
    could be defined.</p>"
