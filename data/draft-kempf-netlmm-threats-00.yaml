abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document discusses security threats to NETLMM-based mobilitymanagement
    with a focus on threats on the interface between mobilenodes and access routers.
    Threats to the NETLMM protocol itself,which runs between the access routers and
    mobility anchor points, aresimilar to those faced by other protocols between network
    entitieslike routers. These threats are handled in the NETLMM protocolspecification.
    In contrast, threats on the interface between mobilenodes and access routers are
    different, because the access routersare presenting the NETLMM domain as a single
    subnet, in order toallow mobile nodes to continue using the same IP address as
    they movefrom one access router to another.</p>"
