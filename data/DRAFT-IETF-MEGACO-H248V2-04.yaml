  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the second version of the general-purpose
    \ngateway control protocol standardized as Megaco in the IETF and as \nRecommendation
    H.248 (now H.248.1) in the ITU-T.  It is common text \nwith Recommendation H.248.1
    (05/02), published by the ITU-T.  Megaco \nv2 includes the corrections to RFC
    3015 which resulted in RFC xxxx \n[draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr-02.txt], plus the
    following new \ncapabilities: \n- ability to audit specific properties, events,
    signals and \nstatistics \n- use of serviceChange to indicate that capabilities
    have changed in \nthe Media Gateway \n- playing a signal on the Root Termination
    \n- limiting the number of repetitions of transaction pending \n- allowing topology
    to be set per stream \n- ability to audit context properties \n- new Nx64K multiplex
    type \n- provision for digit buffering when a digit map completes. \nIn addition,
    the use of the Modem Descriptor was deprecated. \nA detailed list of changes from
    draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr-\n02.txt/H.248.1 (03/02) to this document is given
