abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transporting IPv4 packets over IPv6 is a common solution to
    the\n   problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider networks.\n
    \  A number of differing functional approaches have been developed for\n   this,
    each having their own specific characteristics.  As these\n   approaches share
    a similar functional architecture and use the same\n   data plane mechanisms,
    this memo describes a specification whereby a\n   single CPE can interwork with
    all of the standardized and proposed\n   approaches to providing encapsulated
    IPv4 in IPv6 services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
