abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Token Cell Routing is a powerful yet hardware friendly method
    of\n   constructing data plane packets to meet the needs of new\n   applications.
    \ It is based on the use of token cells (special kinds\n   of lightly structured
    tokens) to provide pointers to procedures pre-\n   positioned in the forwarding
    layer together with the parameters\n   needed to provide the required processing
    context.  A packet can be\n   composed from multiple token cells as needed to
    result in new new\n   network processing and forwarding semantics.\n\n\t </p>\n
