abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite and 6RD so
    thatboth IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6servers.The
    DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBandelement (B4) proxying
    IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS-Lite Address Family Transition Router
    element (AFTR). IPv4 multicastdata received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then
    delivered to thehosts. IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.The
    6RD protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6RD Customer Edgeand then tunneling
    MLD messages to 6RD Border Relays where IPv6multicast routing is supported. Multicast
    data received at 6RDBorder Relay is tunneled to 6RD Customer Edge node and then
    deliveredto the hosts. We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supportedin
    a similar way.</p>"
