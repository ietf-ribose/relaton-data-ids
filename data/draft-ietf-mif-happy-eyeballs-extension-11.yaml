abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes extensions to the Happy Eyeball's algorithm requirements
    defined in RFC6555 for use with the multiple provisioning domain architecture.
    The Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the selection process smoother by using connectivity
    tests over pre-filtered interfaces according to defined policy. This would choose
    the best interface with an automatic fallback mechanism.</p>"
