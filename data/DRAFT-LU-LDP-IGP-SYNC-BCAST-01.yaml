abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[LDP-IGP-SYNC] describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic
    \n(e.g. VPN) when IGP is operational on a link but LDP is not. If this \nmechanism
    is applied to broadcast links that have more than one \nLDP/IGP peer, the cost-out
    procedure can only be applied to the link \nas a whole but not an individual peer.
    When a new LDP peer comes up \non a broadcast network, this can result in loss
    of traffic through \nother established peers on that network. This document describes
    a \nmechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The \nmechanism
    does not introduce any protocol changes.\n\t </p>\n      "
