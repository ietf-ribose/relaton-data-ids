abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OSPF is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC\n
    \  (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given OSPF router\n   within
    the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly\n   the same LSA
    from multiple OSPF neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF\n   neighbors may send each
    other the same LSA simultaneously.  The\n   unneccessary link-state information
    flooding wastes the precious\n   process resource of OSPF routers greatly due
    to the fact that there\n   are too many OSPF neighbors for each OSPF router within
    the CLOS\n   topology.  This document proposes some extensions to OSPF so as to\n
    \  reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction\n   of
    the OSPF flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of\n   MSDC networks.
    \ These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3.\n\n\t </p>\n
