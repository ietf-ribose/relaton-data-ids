abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the X.500
    information schema and matching rules to support Certificate path processing,
    certificate status and CRL mechanisms. These enhancements provide advantages over
    existing Certificate validation and CRL mechanisms. In particular, the mechanisms
    proposed can: (a) reduce the need for unnecessarily fetching CRLs; (b) allow certificate
    status-CRL evaluation time to be improved; (c) provide a directory supported certificate
    test and fetch capability; (d) better support use of certificates in multiple
    environments with different CRL arrangements. (e) simplify the client software
    in the areas of certificate path, certificate validity and CRL processing. (f)
    provide the client a range of trust options when validating certificates. (g)
    provide a range of implementation options so that gradual adoption is possible.
    This document is submitted for consideration as the basis of possible future IETF/ITU
    standardization. Please send comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.com
    mail list.</p>"
