abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to
    determine\n   if a complete Internet path can meet predefined bulk transport\n
    \  performance targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to key infrastructure,
    such as interconnects or even\n   individual devices, to accurately detect if
    any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent any path traversing it from meeting
    the\n   specified target performance.\n\n   The diagnostic tests consist of precomputed
    traffic patterns and\n   statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery.
    \ The traffic\n   patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n
    \  over a long path but are constructed in such a way that they are\n   independent
    of the actual details of the subpath under test, end\n   systems or applications.
    \ Likewise the success criteria depends on\n   the packet delivery statistics
    of the subpath, as evaluated against a\n   protocol model applied to the target
    performance.  The success\n   criteria also does not depend on the details of
    the subpath, end\n   systems or application.  This makes the measurements open
    loop,\n   eliminating most of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk\n
    \  transport metrics.\n\n   Model based metrics exhibit several important new
    properties not\n   present in other Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability
    to\n   reason about concatenated or overlapping subpaths.  The results are\n   vantage
    independent which is critical for supporting independent\n   validation of tests
    results from multiple Measurement Points.\n\n   This document does not define
    diagnostic tests directly, but provides\n   a framework for designing suites of
    IP diagnostics tests that are\n   tailored to confirming that infrastructure can
    meet a predetermined\n   target performance.\n\n   Interim DRAFT Formatted: Sat
