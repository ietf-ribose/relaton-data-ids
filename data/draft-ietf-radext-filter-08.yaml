abstract:
- content: "<p>While RFC 2865 defines the Filter-Id attribute, it requires that the
    Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired filters. However,
    in situations where the server operator does not know which filters have been
    pre-populated, it is useful to specify filter rules explicitly. This document
    defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In
    User Service (RADIUS). This attribute is based on the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule
    Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and the IPFilterRule syntax
    defined in RFC 3588. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
