abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HIP DEX (Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange) is a light-weight
    key\n   exchange protocol designed for constrained devices.  MLE (Mesh Link\n
    \  Establishment) is defined for establishing and configuring secure\n   links
    in IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networks.  This document defines an\n   extension of MLE
    protocol to encapsulate HIP DEX key exchange\n   protocol messages.\n\n\t </p>\n
