abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable
    for\n   applications transmitting real-time data such as audio, video or\n   simulation
    data, over multicast or unicast network services.  The\n   data transport is augmented
    by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow\n   monitoring of the data delivery in a
    manner scalable to large\n   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control
    and identification\n   functionality.\n\n   The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes
    a registry of profile\n   names for use by higher-level control protocols, such
    as the SDP, to\n   refer to the transport methods.  This specification describes
    the\n   following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP\n
    \  Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',\n   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP',
    'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',\n   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.\n\n\t </p>\n
