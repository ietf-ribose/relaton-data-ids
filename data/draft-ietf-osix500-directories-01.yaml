abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF has established a Working Group on OSI Directory Services.
    A major component of the initial work of this group is to establish a technical
    framework for establishing a Directory Service on the Internet, making use of
    the X.500 protocols and services. This document summarises the strategy established
    by the Working Group, and describes a number of RFCs which will be written in
    order to establish the technical framework.</p>"
