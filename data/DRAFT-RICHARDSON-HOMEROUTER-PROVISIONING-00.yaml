abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to provisioning an 802.1AR-style\n
    \  certificate into a router intended for use in the home.\n\n   The proceedure
    results in a certificate which can be validated with a\n   public trust anchor
    (\"WebPKI\"), using a name rather than an IP\n   address.  This method is focused
    on home routers, but can in some\n   cases be used by other classes of IoT devices.\n\n
