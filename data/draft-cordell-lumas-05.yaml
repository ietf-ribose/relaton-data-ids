abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of methods and tools are available for defining the format
    of messages used for application protocols. However, many of these methods and
    tools have been designed for purposes other than message definition, and have
    been adopted on the basis that they are available rather than being ideally suited
    to the task. This often means that the methods make it difficult to get definitions
    correct, or result in unnecessary complexity and verbosity both in the definition
    and on the wire. Lumas - Language for Universal Message Abstraction and Specification
    - has been custom designed for the purpose of message definition. It is thus easy
    to specify messages in a compact, extensible format that is readily machine manipulated
    to produce a compact encoding on the wire.</p>"
