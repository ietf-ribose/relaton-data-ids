abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile
    Nodemust share a security association with its Home agent and itsCorrespondent
    Nodes to send the binding update; these messages mustbe authenticated to prevent
    potential denial of service attacks [2].The MN and the Home Agent can have a static
    security association,established at the configuration time, but the case of theCorrespondent
    Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed thatthe MN and the CN have any
    pre-established security association.</p>"
