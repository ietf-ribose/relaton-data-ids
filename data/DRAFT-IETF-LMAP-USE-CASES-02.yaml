abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important
    for\n   network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public\n   policy.
    \ To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data\n   instructed by a
    measurement controller, and then upload the\n   measurement results to a designated
    measurement server. Understanding\n   the various scenarios and users of measuring
    broadband performance is\n   essential to development of the framework, information
    model and\n   protocol.  The details of the measurement metrics themselves are\n
    \  beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
