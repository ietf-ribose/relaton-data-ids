abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document identifies the basic information to be handled byService
    Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) whenconsidering the deployment
    of value-added IP service offerings overthe Internet. Such IP service offerings
    can be provided together witha given quality of service (QoS), which is expected
    to be defined insuch SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services
    arelikely to be provided over the whole Internet, their correspondingQoS will
    be based upon a set of technical parameters that bothcustomers and services providers
    will have to agree upon. From thisperspective, this draft aims at listing (and
    promoting a standardformalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually
    composethe elementary contents of a SLS.</p>"
