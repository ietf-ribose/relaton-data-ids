abstract:
- content: "<p>In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal],
    opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels.
    An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically by every router to keep all
    nodes in sync. This document provides a mechanism by which small details critical
    for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes may be carried within the Enhanced
    Beacon.</p>"
