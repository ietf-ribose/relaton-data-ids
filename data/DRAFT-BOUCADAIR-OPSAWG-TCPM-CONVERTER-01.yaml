abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of important TCP extensions, e.g., Multipath
    TCP\n   support at the server side, some service providers now consider a\n   network-assisted
    model that relies upon the activation of a dedicated\n   function called Transport
    Converters.  For example, network-assisted\n   Multipath TCP deployment models
    are designed to facilitate the\n   adoption of Multipath TCP for the establishment
    of multi-path\n   communications without making any assumption about the support
    of\n   Multipath TCP by the remote servers.  Transport Converters located in\n
    \  the network are responsible for establishing multi-path\n   communications
    on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of\n   Multipath TCP capabilities
    to achieve different goals that include\n   (but are not limited to) optimization
    of resource usage (e.g.,\n   bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup\n
    \  communication paths), and traffic offload management.\n\n   This document specifies
    a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attributes that
    carry the IP addresses that will be\n   returned to authorized users to reach
    one or multiple Converters.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
