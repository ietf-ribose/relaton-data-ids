abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Content internetworking (also referred to as content distribution\ninternetworking,
    or CDI) is the technology for interconnecting content\nnetworks. The CDI model
    allows for  interconnecting various Content\nNetworks. The internetworking  task
    requires request routing and\ncontent distribution protocols. This document investigates
    the\nsecurity risks and threats  associated with the content\ninternetworking.
    Proposed remedies are viewed not as design\nrecommendations but more as illustrations
    of the nature of threats.\n\t </p>\n      "
