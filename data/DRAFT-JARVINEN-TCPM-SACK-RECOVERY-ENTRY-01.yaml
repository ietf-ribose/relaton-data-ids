abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss\n
    recovery based on the information gathered on a SACK scoreboard\n instead of simply
    counting the number of arriving duplicate\n acknowledgements in the traditional
    way. The given algorithm is more\n robust to ACK losses, ACK reordering, missed
    duplicate\n acknowledgements due to delayed acknowledgements, and extra\n duplicate
    acknowledgements due to duplicated segments and out-of-\n window segments. The
    algorithm allows not only a timely initiation\n of TCP loss recovery but also
    reduces false fast retransmits.  It\n has a low implementation cost on top of
    the SACK scoreboard defined\n in RFC 3517.\n\t </p>\n      "
