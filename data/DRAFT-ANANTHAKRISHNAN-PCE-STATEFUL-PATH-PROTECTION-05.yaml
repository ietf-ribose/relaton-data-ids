abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) is capable of computing
    as\n   well as controlling via Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)\n   Multiprotocol
    Label Switching Traffic Engineering Label Switched\n   Paths (MPLS LSP).  Furthermore,
    it is also possible for a stateful\n   PCE to create, maintain, and delete LSPs.
    \ This document describes\n   PCEP extension to associate two or more LSPs to
    provide end-to-end\n   path protection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
