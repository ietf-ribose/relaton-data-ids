abstract:
- content: <p>OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up
    of primary keys, user IDs, identity certifications ("signature packets"), subkeys,
    and so on. They are often assembled by merging multiple certificates that all
    share the same primary key, and distributed in public keystores. Unfortunately,
    since any third-party can add certifications with any content to any OpenPGP certificate,
    the assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or undistributable.
    This draft documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP certificates can use
    to mitigate the impact of these third-party certificate flooding attacks.</p>
