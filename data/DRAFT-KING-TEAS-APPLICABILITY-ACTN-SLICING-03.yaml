abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a
    network\n   domain to select network resources by policy to obtain a view of\n
    \  potential connectivity\n\n   Network slicing is an approach to network operations
    that builds on\n   the concept of network abstraction to provide programmability,\n
    \  flexibility, and modularity.  It may use techniques such as Software\n   Defined
    Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\n   to create multiple
    logical (virtual) networks, each tailored for a\n   set of services that are sharing
    the same set of requirements, on\n   top of a common network.\n\n   These logical
    networks are referred to as transport network slices.\n   A transport network
    slice does not necessarily represent dedicated\n   resources in the network, but
    does constitute a commitment by the\n   network provider to provide a specific
    level of service.\n\n   The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
    (ACTN)\n   defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of\n
    \  network and service abstraction to detach network and service\n   control from
    the underlying data plane.\n\n   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN
    to transport\n   network slicing in an IETF technology network.  It also identifies\n
    \  the features of network slicing not currently within the scope of\n   ACTN,
    and indicates where ACTN might be extended.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
