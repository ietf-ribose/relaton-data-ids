abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF has maintained a three-stage standards track for some time,with
    basic mechanics set out in RFC 2026 [RFC2026]. The mechanics asdescribed, however,
    are not currently used in practice andadvancement along the standards track is
    both unusual and moredifficult than many IETF participants find reasonable. This
    documentproposes an update to those mechanics, in the interest of improvingthe
    overall functioning of the IETF. It is compatible with, but doesnot require, a
    move to a two-stage standards track.</p>"
