abstract:
- content: "<p>Current CCAMP works focus on intra-domain control plane. This document
    focuses on inter-domain control plane. It views the overall network as a collection
    of administrative domains, partitioned by operators according to administrative,
    technological or geographical considerations. This document specifies a BGP/GMPLS
    based inter-domain solution for setting up circuit LSPs(Label Switched Paths)
    that span multiple administrative domains. A few extensions and modifications
    are proposed to BGP in order to disseminate appropriate topology information and
    calculate end-to-end circuit paths. GMPLS signaling is also extended for the inter-domain
    connection operations. The solution specified in this draft is fundermental for
    inter-domain operations and can be used as a base for various applications, e.g.
    OVPN. It is also very flexible and scalable.</p>"
