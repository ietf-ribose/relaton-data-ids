abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   RFC 2461 [ND] describes host data forwarding and address
    resolution.\n   However, nine years after the ND protocol became an RFC, IPv6
    hosts\n   still do not fully comply with RFC 2461 [ND].  In particular, hosts\n
    \  incorrectly implement on- vs. off-link data forwarding.  The set of\n   new
    requirements beyond what has been specified in RFC 2461 [ND] and\n   RFC 2462
    [ADDRCONF] is restricted to clarifications deemed necessary\n   to facilitate
    correct implementation.  The intention of this document\n   is to incorporate
    normative changes into\n\n\t </p>\n      "
