abstract:
  content: "\t <t>With interface multihoming, Mobile Nodes are capable of simultaneousattachment
    to multiple radio access networks. This enables a networknode such as the Local
    Mobility Anchor to distribute the applicationtraffic to interfaces that can best
    serve them. This documentspecifies a network-controlled protocol to handover application
    flowsfrom one interface to another. Such control could provide betterexperience
    for end users and better traffic management for networkoperators.</p>"
