abstract:
- content: "<p>The management of hosts and risks is important for enterprises that
    have large scale IP space. For IPv4, it won't take too long even to scan the entire
    Internet address space. For IPv6, further consideration is needed. A narrow range
    of IPv6 address is preferred for scanning. And in order to shorten the time for
    IPv6 scanning, a very specific IPv6 address list is highly needed. This document
    proposes a solution to solve the problem. At first, append the information of
    the collection point address to the Router Advertisement packet sent by the router,
    and announce this address information to all nodes in the subnet. Then, each host
    node report its own IPv6 address information to the designated collection point
    by using Echo Reply message. After that, the corresponding collection point device
    should save these information. In this way, online IPv6 address information in
    the current network can be quickly collected on the collection point device.</p>"
