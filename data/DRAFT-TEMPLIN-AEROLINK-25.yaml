abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IPv6 over tunnel virtual\n
    \  Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) links using Asymmetric Extended\n   Route
    Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange\n   packets via
    trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding\n   services to reach off-link
    destinations and redirection services for\n   route optimization.  AERO provides
    an IPv6 link-local address format\n   known as the AERO address for operation
    of the IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery (ND) protocol.  Admission control and provisioning
    are\n   supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6),
    and node mobility is naturally supported through dynamic\n   neighbor cache updates.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
