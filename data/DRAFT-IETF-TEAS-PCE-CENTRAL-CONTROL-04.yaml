abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has become established as
    a core\n   component of Software Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can\n   compute
    optimal paths for traffic across a network for most\n   definitions of \"optimal\"
    and can also monitor changes in resource\n   availability and traffic demands
    to update the paths.\n\n   Conventionally, the PCE has been used to derive paths
    for MPLS Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).  These paths are supplied using the
    Path\n   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to the head end of\n
    \  the LSP for signaling in the MPLS network.\n\n   SDN has a far broader applicability
    than just signaled MPLS traffic\n   engineered networks, and the PCE may be used
    to determine paths in a\n   wide range of use cases including static LSPs, segment
    routing,\n   service function chaining (SFC), and indeed most forms of routed
    or\n   switched network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a\n
    \  control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be\n   fully
    enabled as a central controller.\n\n   This document briefly introduces the architecture
    for PCE as a\n   central controller, examines the motivations and applicability
    for\n   PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the\n   implications
    for the protocol.  A PCE-based central controller can\n   simplify the processing
    of distributed control plane by blending it\n   with elements of SDN and without
    necessarily completely replacing it.\n\n   This document does not describe use
    cases in detail and does not\n   define protocol extensions: that work is left
    for other documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
