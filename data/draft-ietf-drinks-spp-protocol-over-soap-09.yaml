abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) specifies the data
    model and the overall structure to provision Session Establishment Data (SED)
    into Session Data Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores. To utilize
    this framework, one needs a substrate protocol. Given that the Simple Object Access
    Protocol (SOAP) is currently widely used for messaging between elements of such
    provisioning systems, this document specifies the usage of SOAP (via HTTPS) as
    the substrate protocol for SPPF. The benefits include leveraging prevalent expertise
    and a higher probability that existing provisioning systems will be able to easily
    migrate to using an \\%SPPF- based protocol.</p>"
