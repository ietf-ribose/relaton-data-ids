abstract:
  content: "\t <t>With LCAS and VCAT, the transport layer is capable of not onlyproviding
    right-sized data pipes, but also elastic pipes. Fluidtransport pipes spur services
    like frame-relay transport (CIR, EIR)and intelligent COS-aware protection. The
    popular protocol used toconvey control information in SONET networks is GMPLS.
    There are twoaspects of control mechanisms for a connection: call-control andconnection-control.
    Call-control is used to establish a signalingassociation between two end-points,
    whereas connection-control isused to setup and modify the attributes (e.g., bandwidth)
    of antransport connection. This draft deals with signaling requirementsfor connection-control
    of elastic pipes.</p>"
