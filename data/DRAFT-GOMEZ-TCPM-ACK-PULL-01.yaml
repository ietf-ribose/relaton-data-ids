abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead
    in\n   many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may\n   significantly
    degrade network and device performance in terms of link\n   utilization, latency,
    memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This\n   document defines the TCP ACK
    Pull (AKP) mechanism, which allows a\n   sender to request the ACK for a data
    segment to be sent without\n   additional delay by the receiver.  AKP makes use
    of one of the\n   reserved bits in the TCP header, which is defined in this\n
    \  specification as the AKP flag.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
