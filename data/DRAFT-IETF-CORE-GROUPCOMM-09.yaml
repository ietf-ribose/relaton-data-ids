abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices
    and\n   constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices\n   will
    often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building\n   automation scenario
    all lights in a given room may need to be\n   switched on/off as a group).  This
    document provides guidance for how\n   the CoAP protocol should be used in a group
    communication context.\n   An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is
    detailed.  Also,\n   various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided
    to\n   illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for\n   deployment
    in various network topologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
