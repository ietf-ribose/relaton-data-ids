  content: "<p>This document discribles an Digital Signature Algorithm based on elliptic
    curves which is invented by Xiaoyun Wang et al. This digital signature algorithm
    is published by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office for the
    use of electronic authentication service system. The document *** published by
    Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office includes four parts: general
    introdocution, Digital Signature Algorithm, Key Exchange Protocol and Public Key
    Encryption Algorithm. This document only gives the general introduction and digital
    signature algorithm.</p>"
