abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DSKPP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and\n   configuration)
    of symmetric keys to locally and remotely accessible\n   cryptographic modules.
    \ The protocol can be run with or without\n   private-key capabilities in the
    cryptographic modules, and with or\n   without an established public-key infrastructure.\n\n
    \  Three variations of the protocol support multiple usage scenarios.\n   The
    four-pass (i.e., two round-trip) variant enables key generation\n   in near real-time.
    \ With the four-pass variant, keys are mutually\n   generated by the provisioning
    server and cryptographic module;\n   provisioned keys are not transferred over-the-wire
    or over-the-air.\n   Two- and one-pass variants enable secure and efficient download
    and\n   installation of symmetric keys to a cryptographic module in\n   environments
    where near real-time communication may not be possible.\n\n   This document builds
    on information contained in [RFC4758], adding\n   specific enhancements in response
    to implementation experience and\n   liaison requests.  It is intended, therefore,
    that this document or a\n   successor version thereto will become the basis for
    subsequent\n   progression of a symmetric key provisioning protocol specification
    on\n   the standards track.\n\t </p>\n      "
