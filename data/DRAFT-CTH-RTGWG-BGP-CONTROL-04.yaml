abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP is a core part of a network including Software-Defined
    Networking\n   (SDN) system.  It has the traffic engineering information on the\n
    \  network topology and can compute optimal paths for a given traffic\n   flow
    across the network.\n\n   This document describes some reference architectures
    for BGP as a\n   central controller.  A BGP-based central controller can simplify
    the\n   operations on the network and use network resources efficiently for\n
    \  providing services with high quality.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
