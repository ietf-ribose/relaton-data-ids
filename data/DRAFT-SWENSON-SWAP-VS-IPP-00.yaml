abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) has been compared in conversations
    to SWAP\n(Simple Workflow Access Protocol).  Both are for starting an asynchronous\njob,
    and then being able to check up on it later. The IPP is specifically\ndesigned
    for printers and print jobs.  SWAP is more generic, and is\ngenerally oriented
    toward more computational jobs.  But many of the\nproblems encountered are the
    same, and the approach to the solutions can be\nexamined and compared.  This document
    goes through the features point by\npoint and shows in what ways they are similar,
    and more importantly in what\nways their approaches differ.  The purpose of this
    is to guide discussions\nabout the two protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
