abstract:
  content: "<p>IKE was designed for use with certificates. In a remote accessscenario,
    that implies that clients must possess their owncertificates. We leverage off
    of work already done to fast-startcertificate use with IPsec via the Simple Certificate
    EnrollmentProtocol [SCEP]. We use only parts of SCEP over a clientauthenticated
    TLS/HTTP connection to a CA. By using TLS, the clientcan trust a CA root certificate
    it receives, without an out-of-bandverification and the CA can perform automatic
    enrollment. We replacethe out-of-band client identification process for a certificateenrollment
    with a legacy authentication, like RADIUS. Further, sincethe certificates issued
    here are short-lived, there is no need tosupport client-based revocation or rekeying.
    Also, there istypically no need for CRL support.</p>"
