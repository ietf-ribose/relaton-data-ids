abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting
    up\n   networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does\n   not
    rely on centralized deployed anchors to provide IP mobility\n   support.\n\n   There
    are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility\n   Management,
    as for example extending network-based mobility protocols\n   (like Proxy Mobile
    IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols (as\n   Mobile IPv6), among others.
    \ This document follows the former\n   approach, and proposes a solution based
    on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which\n   mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP
    hop router (called\n   distributed gateway).  The distributed gateway is an enhanced
    access\n   router which is also able to operate as local mobility anchor or\n
    \  mobility access gateway, on a per prefix basis.  The draft focuses on\n   the
    required extensions to effectively support simultaneously\n   anchoring several
    flows at different distributed gateways.\n\n   This draft introduces the concept
    of distributed logical interface\n   (at the distributed gateway), which is a
    software construct that\n   allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the
    mobile node.\n   Additionally, the draft describes how to provide session continuity\n
    \  in inter-domain scenarios in which dynamic tunneling or signaling\n   between
    distributed gateways from different operators is not allowed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
