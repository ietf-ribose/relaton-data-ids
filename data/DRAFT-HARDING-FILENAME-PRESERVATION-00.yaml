abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track
    as an\n   Informational RFC.\n \n   The EDIINT [AS1], [AS2] and [AS3] message
    formats do not currently\n   contain any provisions for preservation of the filename
    of a\n   transmitted EDI business document from one Trading Partner to\n   another.\n
    \  \n   However,within certain trading communities, it is not uncommon for\n   Trading
    Partners to require a specific filenames for EDI business\n   documents to trigger
    specific backend processing. So it is\n   the goal of this informational document
    to outline the procedures\n   and mechanisms required to preserve filenames of
    EDI business\n   documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
