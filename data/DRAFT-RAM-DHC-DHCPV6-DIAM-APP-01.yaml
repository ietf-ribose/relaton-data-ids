abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) \nauthentication,
    as described in RFC3315, makes use of a model \ndescribed in RFC3118. The DHCP
    threat model is described in RFC3118. \nBut RFC3315 does not discuss the dynamic
    establishment of the \nsecurity association between client and the DHCPv6 server.
    Also it \nassumes that the establishment of the security association is done \nout
    of band. \n    \nThis draft proposes to make use of the security association between
    \nDHCPv6 client and the home authentication, authorization and \naccounting (AAAH)
    to establish the security association dynamically \nand in band. This draft defines
    an AAA interface between DHCPv6 \nserver and AAAH which enables the authentication
    of the DHCPv6 client \nwith AAAH.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
