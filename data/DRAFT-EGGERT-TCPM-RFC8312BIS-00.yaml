abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards.  It differs
    from\n   the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on\n
    \  the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of\n   a
    linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to\n   improve scalability
    and stability under fast and long-distance\n   networks.  CUBIC and its predecessor
    algorithm have been adopted as\n   defaults by Linux and have been used for many
    years.  This document\n   provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party\n
    \  implementations and to solicit community feedback through\n   experimentation
    on the performance of CUBIC.\n\n   This documents obsoletes [RFC8312], updating
    the specification of\n   CUBIC to conform to the current Linux version.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
