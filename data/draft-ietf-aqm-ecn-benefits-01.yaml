abstract:
- content: "<p>XXX Author Note: The WG are being asked to consider changing this title
    - see list XXX This document describes the potential benefits and pitfalls when
    applications enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). It outlines the principal
    gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced delay and other benefits when
    ECN is used over network paths that include equipment that supports ECN-marking.
    It also lists potential problems that might occur when ECN is used. The document
    does not propose new algorithms that may be able to use ECN or describe the details
    of implementation of ECN in endpoint devices, routers and other network devices.</p>"
