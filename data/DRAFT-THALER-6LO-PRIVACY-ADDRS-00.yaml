abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is commonly assumed today that 6LowPAN header compression
    is\n   incompatible (or at least inefficient) with the notion of using\n   addresses
    with sufficient entropy to mitigate various security and\n   privacy threats.
    \ This draft explores ways one might dispel that\n   notion, and discusses how
    security/privacy addressing might be used\n   on 6LoWPAN technologies without
    additional overhead in data packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
