abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths by encoding paths as sequences of sub-paths, called \"segments\".\n   Segment
    routing architecture can be implemented over IPv6 data plane,\n   called SRv6.
    \ In some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection\n   and Performance
    Measurement (PM), SRv6 path need to be identified.\n   This document defines the
    encoding and processing of Path Segment in\n   SRv6 networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
