abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several scalability issues in current
    in-situ\n   OAM documents and proposes corresponding solutions.  Specifically,
    we\n   extend in-situ OAM to support more standard tracing data than is\n   currently
    defined and add new features to avoid limitations on MTU,\n   bandwidth, forwarding
    path length, and node processing capability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
