abstract:
- content: "<p>The procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with EVPN
    control plane is defined as part of RFC 7432. EVPN has since evolved to find wider
    applicability across various IRB use cases that include distributing both MAC
    and IP reachability via a common EVPN control plane. MAC Mobility procedures defined
    in RFC 7432 are extensible to IRB use cases if a fixed 1:1 mapping between VM
    IP and MAC is assumed across VM moves. Generic mobility support for IP and MAC
    that allows these bindings to change across moves is required to support a broader
    set of EVPN IRB use cases, and requires further consideration. EVPN all-active
    multi-homing further introduces scenarios that require additional consideration
    from mobility perspective. Intent of this draft is to enumerate a set of design
    considerations applicable to mobility across EVPN IRB use cases and define generic
    sequence number assignment procedures to address these IRB use cases.</p>"
