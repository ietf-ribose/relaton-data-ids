abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security but filtered
    DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the
    filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially
    if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document defines a mechanism
    to explain the reason for the DNS filtering and provides HTTPS URIs to get more
    detail. This information can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or
    used for other purposes. This document updates RFC8914 to contain I-JSON in its
    EXTRA-TEXT field.</p>"
