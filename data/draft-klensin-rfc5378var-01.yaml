abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 5378, \"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust\", has
    beeninterpreted in a way that is unworkable in practice for updates todocuments
    created before it came into effect, and for other documentsthat derive significant
    amounts of text from such earlier documents.It requires, as a condition of Internet
    Draft posting or RFCpublication or even as a condition of posting of Internet
    Drafts,that authors or editors obtain rights from people who may beunavailable
    or uncooperative. This specification modifies the RFC5378 rules to permit the
    IETF to continue to do work in an orderlyfashion when documents containing earlier
    text are involved andpermission is not easily obtained.</p>"
