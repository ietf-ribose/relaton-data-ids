abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by
    a DNSSEC\n   enabled Recursive Nameserver configured as a forwarder to send a\n
    \  single query over TCP requesting to receive a complete validation\n   path
    along with the regular query answer.  Additionally, use of this\n   option is
    considered a request to keep the TCP connection open to\n   serve additional DNS
    requests.  Use of this option significantly\n   reduces DNS latency for hosts
    deploying DNSSEC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
