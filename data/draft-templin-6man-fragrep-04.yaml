abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) provides a fragmentation and reassembly
    service for end systems allowing for the transmission of packets that exceed the
    path MTU. However, loss of individual fragments requires retransmission of original
    packets in their entirety leading to cascading reassembly failures. This document
    specifies an IPv6 fragment retransmission scheme that matches the loss unit to
    the retransmission unit. The document further specifies an update to Path MTU
    Discovery that distinguishes hard link size restrictions from reassembly congestion
    events.</p>"
