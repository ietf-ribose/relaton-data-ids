abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 4960, if approved. It describes the Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and incorporates the specification of the
    chunk flags registry from RFC 6096 and the specification of the I bit of DATA
    chunks from RFC 7053. Therefore, RFC 6096 and RFC 7053 are also obsoleted by this
    document, if approved. SCTP was originally designed to transport Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks. It is also suited
    to be used for other applications, for example WebRTC. SCTP is a reliable transport
    protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers
    the following services to its users: * acknowledged error-free non-duplicated
    transfer of user data, * data fragmentation to conform to discovered path maximum
    transmission unit (PMTU) size, * sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple
    streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages,
    * optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and *
    network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or
    both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion
    avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.</p>"
