abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RSS Feeds have always played an important role in providing users
    \n        content related updates typically of Websites without having to visit
    \n        those websites manually. Typical examples of RSS usage include users
    \n        'subscribing' to the RSS feed of a website, say, CNN.com and thereby
    \n        automatically receiving 'news headlines' when the content changes. \n\n
    \       Recently, there have been significant innovations (such as Yahoo \n        Pipes
    and Google Mash-up Editor) where RSS feeds from different \n        sources have
    been combined to produce new services in a 'Web Based \n        Service Creation
    Environment' model allowing users to create \n        interesting services building
    on top of 'primitives' that can be \n        represented on the Web.  \n\n        This
    document describes the motivation for an RSS feed for Presence \n        information,
    which the authors believe would be useful to create new \n        services using
    a similar environment described above.\n\t </p>\n      "
