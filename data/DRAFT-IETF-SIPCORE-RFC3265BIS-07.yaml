abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\n
    \  Protocol (SIP).  The purpose of this extension is to provide an\n   extensible
    framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from\n   remote nodes indicating
    that certain events have occurred.\n\n   Note that the event notification mechanisms
    defined herein are NOT\n   intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for
    all classes of\n   event subscription and notification.\n\n   This document represents
    a backwards-compatible improvement on the\n   original mechanism described by
    RFC 3265, taking into account several\n   years of implementation experience.
    \ Accordingly, this document\n   obsoletes RFC 3265.  This document also updates
    RFC 4660 slightly to\n   accommodate some small changes to the mechanism that
    were discussed\n   in that document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
