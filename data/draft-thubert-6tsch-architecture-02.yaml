abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet
    that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of IEEE802.15.4e
    TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by Backbone Routers. Route Computation
    may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed
    fashion using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed
    mode. The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery operations over the
    backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so they can share a same subnet and
    appear to be connected to the same backbone as classical devices.</p>"
