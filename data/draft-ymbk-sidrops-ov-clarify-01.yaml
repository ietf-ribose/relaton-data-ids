abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered by, among
    other things, vendor mis-implementations in two critical areas, which routes are
    validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration. This
    document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those mis-implementations.</p>"
