abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/.  When
    MPLS \nlabels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an \nMPLS
    VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice \npayload is often
    no more than 30 bytes.  VoIP header compression can \nsignificantly reduce the
    VoIP overhead through various compression \nmechanisms.  This is important on
    access links where bandwidth is \nscarce, and can be important on backbone facilities,
    especially where \ncosts are high (e.g., some global cross-sections).  Providing
    VoIP \nheader compression over multiple hop paths avoids multiple \ncompression/decompression
    cycles at each router, and thereby increases \nthe processing scalability of the
    maximum number of simultaneous VoIP \nflows which use header compression at each
    router.  This draft gives a \nproblem statement, example scenarios, goals, and
    requirements for VoIP \nheader compression from compressor to decompressor over
    multiple-hop \npaths, possibly over MPLS.  It also discusses work items and issues
    for \nconsideration, and highlights various solution alternatives that have \nbeen
    proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
