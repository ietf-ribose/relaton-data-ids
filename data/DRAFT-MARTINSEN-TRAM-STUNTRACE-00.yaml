abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   After a UDP protocol such as RTP determines a network path
    is\n   experiencing problems, a traceroute is often useful to determine\n   which
    router or which link is contributing to the problem.  However,\n   operating system
    traceroute commands follow a different path than the\n   actual UDP flow which
    complicates troubleshooting.  A superior method\n   is shown which is absolutely
    path-congruent with the UDP protocol\n   itself, works on IPv4 and IPv6, and does
    not require administrative\n   privileges on most operating systems.\n\n\t </p>\n
