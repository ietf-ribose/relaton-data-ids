abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document
    has\n   a likely-bad suggestion of how to run DNS service over existing QUIC\n
    \  connections, such as those being used for HTTP for basic web service.\n   The
    author no longer recommends to do this.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
