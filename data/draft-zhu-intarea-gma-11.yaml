abstract:
- content: "<p>A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,
    Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly combine the connectivity
    over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve quality of experience
    for applications that do not have built in multi-path capabilities. Such optimization
    requires additional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet.
    This document presents a new light weight and flexible encapsulation protocol
    for this need. The solution has been developed by the authors based on their experiences
    in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet Standard
    and does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF. This document will enable
    other developers to build interoperable implementations in order to experiment
    with the protocol.</p>"
