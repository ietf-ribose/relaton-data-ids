abstract:
- content: "<p>As network expand bridging access, Data Center and WAN, more networks
    have a central control point for the network elements in one administrative domain.
    This document defines that network device as central control network element (CCNE).
    The CCNE can be RR Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE Server,
    or other devices. This document describes use case where the CCNE can utilize
    both these the traditional functions and the programmatic Interface to Routing
    System (I2RS) to communicate with devices in the network. The I2RS use cases described
    in this document encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network
    by PCE Server. The goal of this document is to inform the community's understanding
    of how CCNE extensions fit within the overall I2RS architecture. It is intended
    to provide a basis for the solutions draft describing the set of interfaces for
    the CCNE device.</p>"
