abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a type of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
    for new\n   STIR Working Group participants.  Since its inception three months\n
    \  ago there have been over 1,500 emails on the mailing list, before\n   the WG
    was even formed.  Some of the emails repeat topics, because\n   newcomers cannot
    be expected to read all previous emails in the\n   archive.  This document is
    an attempt to capture some of the\n   previously asked and answered questions.\n\n
    \  This document is written by one individual, is not intended to be\n   published
    as an RFC, and is only meant as a temporary FAQ while the\n   Working Group begins.
    \ The document attempts to provide both high-\n   level information for non-experts,
    as well as low-level information\n   for protocol experts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
