abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture for clustering in
    the MANET\n   which can be an efficient communication structure for the case\n
    \  when MANET nodes have the tendency of forming groups. In this type of\n   MANET,
    each group of nodes forms a cluster which is represented by a\n   cluster head.
    In this draft, we define the terminology for the MANET\n   clustering and the
    related communication procedure.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
