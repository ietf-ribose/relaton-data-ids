abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides a proposal for a new Internet protocol,which
    should improve the relevance of results of search requestsfor information in the
    WWW. It contains a description of thebasic model and the minimum set of commands
    necessary to runproperly. It is neither meant to nor should be regarded as adefinitive
    version, but rather as a suggestion to a new way oflooking at the relations between
    the search engines on one handand hosts running WEB servers on the other.</p>"
