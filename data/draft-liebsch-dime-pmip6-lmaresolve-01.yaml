abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobilityservice
    authorization and home network prefix allocation for ProxyMobile IPv6. The protocol
    operates between a Local Mobility Anchorand a AAA server. Furthermore, the associated
    specification extendsthe existing protocol for network access service to support
    dynamicassignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor during theauthentication
    procedure. The AAA server maintains mobile nodes'profile in a policy store, which
    includes information about theassigned Local Mobility Anchor as well as the home
    network prefix.This document proposes a further extension to allow Local MobilityAnchors
    benefit from the AAA server's policy store and resolve anunknown mobile node's
    IP address into a routable address of itsassigned Local Mobility Anchor.</p>"
