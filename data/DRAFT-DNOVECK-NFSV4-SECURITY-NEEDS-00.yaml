abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the existing inadequacies in the handling
    of\n   security issues within the NFSv4 protocols and the steps that might\n   be
    taken to correct the situation, including the preparation of new\n   standards-track
    documents updating existing ones.  Because the\n   security approach has been
    and should remain the same for all minor\n   versions, it is expected that security
    for all the NFSv4 protocols\n   will be addressed together in a single NFSv4-wide
    standards-track\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
