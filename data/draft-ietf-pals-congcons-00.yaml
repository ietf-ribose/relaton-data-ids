abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling traffic,
    and may be found in unmanaged scenarios competing for network resources both with
    other PWs and with non-PW traffic, such as TCP/IP flows. It is thus worthwhile
    specifying under what conditions such competition is acceptable, i.e., the PW
    traffic does not significantly harm other traffic or contribute more than it should
    to congestion. We conclude that PWs transporting responsive traffic behave as
    desired without the need for additional mechanisms. For inelastic PWs (such as
    TDM PWs) we derive a bound under which such PWs consume no more network capacity
    than a TCP flow. We also propose employing a transport circuit breaker that shuts
    down a TDM PW that persistently fails to comply with acceptable TDM service criteria.</p>"
