abstract:
  content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
    that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance
    measurement. Over the years, various OAM tools have been defined for various layers
    in the protocol stack. This document summarizes some of the OAM tools defined
    in the IETF in the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP),
    pseudowires, and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL). This document
    focuses on tools for detecting and isolating failures in networks and for performance
    monitoring. Control and management aspects of OAM are outside the scope of this
    document. Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute (FRR) and protection switching,
    which are often triggered by OAM protocols, are also out of the scope of this
    document. The target audience of this document includes network equipment vendors,
    network operators, and standards development organizations. This document can
    be used as an index to some of the main OAM tools defined in the IETF. At the
    end of the document, a list of the OAM toolsets and a list of the OAM functions
    are presented as a summary.</p>"
