abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Spoken language is human nature. An IDN system that users want
    is \nalways closely associated with linguistic issues. To represent a symbol \nof
    a script consistently, recognizable and easily accessible for \nwidest acceptance
    around the world has been the wish of many Internet \nengineers. For sensible,
    thus consistent and lasting IDN Domain Name \nidentifiers, these symbols have
    to be indexed on their phonetics, which \nis the basic element of linguistics.
    A joint effort from Unicode \nConsortium, Library of Congress, The International
    Phonetic Association \nand IETF IDN working group is necessary to codify transliteration
    scheme.\n\t </p>\n      "
