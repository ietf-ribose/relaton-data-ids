abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Application Data Model (ADM) for
    an\n   Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) Agent.  The AMP Agent\n   represents
    a managed device in the Asynchronous Management\n   Architecture.  This ADM identifies
    the Externally Defined Data,\n   Variables, Report Templates, Controls, Macros,
    Literals, Operators,\n   and meta-data associated with an Agent.  The information
    outlined in\n   this document MUST be supported by any software claiming to act
    as a\n   managed device within the AMP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
