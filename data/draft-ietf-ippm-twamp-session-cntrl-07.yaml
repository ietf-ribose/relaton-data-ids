abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP
    -- the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol. This memo describes an OPTIONAL feature
    for TWAMP, that gives the controlling host the ability to start and stop one or
    more individual test sessions using Session Identifiers. The base capability of
    the TWAMP protocol requires all test sessions that were previously requested and
    accepted to start and stop at the same time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
