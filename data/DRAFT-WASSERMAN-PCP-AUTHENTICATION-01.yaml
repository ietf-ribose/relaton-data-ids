abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An IPv4 or IPv6 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP)
    to\n   flexibly manage the IP address and port mapping information on\n   Network
    Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls, to facilitate\n   communications with
    remote hosts.  However, the un-controlled\n   generation or deletion of IP address
    mappings on such network devices\n   may cause security risks and should be avoided.
    \ In some cases the\n   client may need to prove that it is authorized to modify,
    create or\n   delete PCP mappings.  This document proposes an in-band\n   authentication
    mechanism for PCP that can be used in those cases.\n   The Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) is used to perform\n   authentication between PCP devices.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
