abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern the behavior
    of all IETF participants with respect to intellectual property about which they
    might reasonably be aware. The IETF takes conformance to these IPR policies very
    seriously. However, there has been some ambiguity as to what the appropriate sanctions
    are for the violation of these policies, and how and by whom those sanctions are
    to be applied. This document discusses these issues and provides a suite of potential
    actions that may be taken within the IETF community.</p>"
