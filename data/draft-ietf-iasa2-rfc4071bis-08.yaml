abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in ways that required
    changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this document is to document
    and describe the IASA 2.0 structure. Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative
    and fundraising tasks is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF
    Administration Limited Liability Company ("IETF LLC"). Under this structure, the
    IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) was eliminated, and its oversight
    and advising functions transferred to the IETF LLC Board. The IETF LLC provides
    the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB),
    and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and financial support for the operation
    of the RFC Editor. This document describes the structure of the IETF Administrative
    Support Activity, version 2 (IASA 2.0). It defines the roles and responsibilities
    of the IETF LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, and ISOC in the fiscal and
    administrative support of the IETF standards process. It also defines the membership
    and selection rules for the IETF LLC Board. This document obsoletes RFC 4071,
    RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.</p>
