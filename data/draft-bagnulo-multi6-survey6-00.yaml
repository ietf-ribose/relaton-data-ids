abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6multi-homing.
    All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routingarchitecture and current ISP
    address aggregation scheme, inparticular, avoiding route injection to the DFZ.
    Besides, onlynetwork and transport level solutions are introduced, meaning thatapplication
    level solutions are intentionally excluded.</p>"
