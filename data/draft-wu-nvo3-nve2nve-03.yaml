    system to NVE control interface and NVE to Oracle control interface NVE use to
    enable communication between tenant systems, which is complementary to [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp]
    that describes the high level control plane requirements related to the interaction
    between tenant system and NVE when the two entities are not co-located on the
    same physical device.</p>"
