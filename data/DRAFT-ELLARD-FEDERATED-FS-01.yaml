abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes and lists the functional requirements
    of a\n   federated file system and defines related terms.  Our intent is to\n
    \  use this draft as a starting point and refine it, with input and\n   feedback
    from the file system community and other interested parties,\n   until we reach
    general agreement.  We will then begin, again with the\n   help of any interested
    parties, to define standard, open federated\n   file system protocols that satisfy
    these requirements and are\n   suitable for implementation and deployment.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
