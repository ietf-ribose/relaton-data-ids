abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document summarises a problem statement for an IP-based\n
    \  autonomic network that is mainly based on distributed network\n   devices.
    \ The document reviews the history and current status of\n   autonomic aspects
    of IP networks.  It then reviews the current\n   network management style, which
    is still heavily depending on human\n   administrators.  Finally the document
    describes the general gaps\n   between the ideal autonomic network concept and
    the current network\n   abilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
