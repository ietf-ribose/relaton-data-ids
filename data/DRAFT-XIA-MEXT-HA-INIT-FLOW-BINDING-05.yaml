abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding\n
    \  operations towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow\n   binding
    or moving a flow from one interface to another because of\n   network resource
    availability.  This document defines one new\n   Mobility Header, two messages,
    several actions and two new sub-\n   options to perform home agent initiated interactions
    for flow\n   bindings in a mobile node.  Home agent initiated flow bindings are\n
    \  supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
