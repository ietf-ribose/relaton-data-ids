abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) today have some mechanism
    to\n   resolve them to one or more specific endpoints where that resource is\n
    \  available.  This document discusses issues that arise when the same\n   resource
    can be reached over multiple protocol stacks, and discusses\n   various approaches
    that have been used or discussed, and the\n   tradeoffs between them.  Such issues
    are important to consider when\n   defining new URI schemes and resolution mechanisms.\n\n\t
