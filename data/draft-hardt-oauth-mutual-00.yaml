abstract:
- content: "<p>There are times when a user has a pair protected resources that would
    like to request access to each other. While OAuth flows typically enable the user
    to grant a client access to a protected resource, granting the inverse access
    requires an additional flow. Mutual OAuth enables a more seemless experience for
    the user to grant access to a pair of protected resources.</p>"
