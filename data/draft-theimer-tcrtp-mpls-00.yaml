abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth efficiency
    of voice transmission over an IP/MPLS network by combining RTP compression, PPP
    multiplexing and MPLS tunneling. This proposal does not require any additions
    or modifications to existing protocols, and therefore should be fully interoperable
    with existing implementations of RTP compression and PPP multiplexing. It only
    requires specific use of some attributes of MPLS signalling protocols to setup
    a pair of unidirectional MPLS tunnels providing a bidirectional link for compressed
    RTP over PPP.</p>"
