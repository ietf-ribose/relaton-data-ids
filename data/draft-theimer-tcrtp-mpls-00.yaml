abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth efficiencyof
    voice transmission over an IP/MPLS network by combining RTPcompression, PPP multiplexing
    and MPLS tunneling. This proposal doesnot require any additions or modifications
    to existing protocols, andtherefore should be fully interoperable with existing
    implementationsof RTP compression and PPP multiplexing. It only requires specificuse
    of some attributes of MPLS signalling protocols to setup a pairof unidirectional
    MPLS tunnels providing a bidirectional link forcompressed RTP over PPP.</p>"
