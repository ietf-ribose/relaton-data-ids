abstract:
- content: <p>Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry by
    storm. At the same time, IBN-related terms are often used loosely and inconsistently,
    in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "Policy." This
    document clarifies the concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of the functionality
    that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared
    understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as the foundation
    to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and
    their solutions. This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research
    Group (NMRG). It reflects the consensus of the RG, receiving reviews and explicit
    support from many members. It is published for informational purposes.</p>
