abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft suggests a name space for identifier based Internet
    that\n   has been considered to support the future Internet for mobile\n   environment.
    The suggested name space considers a host-centric for\n   the current stage as
    well as an object-centric for the next stage.\n   To consider scalability and
    distributed architecture, the format of\n   the name space consists of object
    category, local name, domain name,\n   and parameters.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
