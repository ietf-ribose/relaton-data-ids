abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problems that enterprises face
    today\n   when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in\n
    \  third party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many\n   problems
    associated with network connecting to or among Clouds, many\n   of which probably
    are out of the IETF scope. The objective of this\n   document is to identify some
    of the problems that need additional\n   work in IETF Routing area. Other problems
    are out of the scope of\n   this document.\n\n   This document focuses on the
    network problems that many enterprises\n   face when they have workloads &amp;
    applications &amp; data split among\n   different data centers, especially for
    those enterprises with\n   multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs
    (e.g., MPLS\n   L2VPN/L3VPN).\n\n   Current operational problems are examined
    to determine whether there\n   is a need to improve existing protocols or whether
    a new protocol is\n   necessary to solve them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
