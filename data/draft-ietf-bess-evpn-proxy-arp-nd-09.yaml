abstract:
- content: "<p>The EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs importing those routes in
    the same Broadcast Domain (BD) can use this information to reply locally (act
    as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages (or 'unicast-forward'
    them to the owner of the MAC) and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the
    Address Resolution procedure. This EVPN capability is extremely useful in Internet
    Exchange Points (IXPs) and Data Centers (DCs) with large BDs, where the amount
    of ARP/ND flooded traffic causes issues on connected routers and CEs. This document
    describes the EVPN Proxy-ARP/ND function augmented by the capability of the ARP/ND
    Extended Community, which together help IXPs and other operators to deal with
    the issues derived from Address Resolution in large BDs.</p>"
