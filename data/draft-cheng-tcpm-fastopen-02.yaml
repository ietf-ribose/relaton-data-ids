abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK
    packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake,
    thus providing a saving of up to one full round trip time (RTT) compared to standard
    TCP requiring a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.
