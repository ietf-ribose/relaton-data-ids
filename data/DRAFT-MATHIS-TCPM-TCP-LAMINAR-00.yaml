abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The primary state variables used by all TCP congestion control\n
    \  algorithms, cwnd and ssthresh are heavily overloaded, carrying\n   different
    semantics in different states.  This leads to excess\n   implementation complexity
    and poorly defined behaviors under some\n   combinations of events, such as loss
    recovery during cwnd validation.\n   We propose a new framework for TCP congestion
    control, and to recast\n   current standard algorithms to use new state variables.
    \ This new\n   framework will not generally change the behavior of any of the\n
    \  primary congestion control algorithms when invoked in isolation but\n   will
    to permit new algorithms with better behaviors in many corner\n   cases, such
    as when two distinct primary algorithms are invoked\n   concurrently.  It will
    also foster the creation of new algorithms to\n   address some events that are
    poorly treated by today's standards.\n   For the vast majority of traditional
    algorithms the transformation to\n   the new state variables is completely straightforward.
    \ However, the\n   resulting implementation will technically be in violation of
    all\n   existing TCP standards, even if it is fully compliant with their\n   principles
    and intent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
