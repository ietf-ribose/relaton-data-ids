abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes requirements for a protocol that would
    \n   perform Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for Quality-of-\n   Service
    reservations.  Such a protocol would be used by entities to \n   authenticate
    a user's reservation request, to ensure that the \n   reservation is authorized
    and to provide accounting functionality.  \n    \n   The requirements covered
    in this document primarily address the \n   communication of AAA protocols and
    not the QoS signaling protocols, \n   although they have to provide some degree
    of interworking. Therefore, \n   we list a minimal set of requirements on supported
    QoS signaling \n   protocols. \n\t </p>\n      "
