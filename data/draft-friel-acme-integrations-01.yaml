abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines multiple advanced use cases and integrations
    that ACME facilitates without any modifications or enhancements required to the
    base ACME specification. These use cases are not immediately obvious from reading
    the ACME specification and thus are explicitly documented here. The use cases
    include ACME issuance of subdomain certificates, and ACME integration with EST
    and TEAP.</p>"
