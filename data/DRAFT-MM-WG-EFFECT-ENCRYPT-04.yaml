abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Increased use of encryption will impact operations for security
    and\n   network management causing a shift in how these functions are\n   performed.
    \ In some cases, new methods to both monitor and protect\n   data will evolve.
    \ In more drastic circumstances, the ability to\n   monitor and troubleshoot may
    be eliminated.  This draft includes a\n   collection of current security and network
    management functions that\n   may be impacted by the shift to increased use of
    encryption.  This\n   draft does not attempt to solve these problems, but rather
    document\n   the current state to assist in the development of alternate options\n
    \  to achieve the intended purpose of the documented practices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
