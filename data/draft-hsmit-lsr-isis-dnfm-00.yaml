abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a technology extension to reduce link-state
    flooding in highly resilient dense networks. It does this by using simple and
    backwards-compatible extensions to reduce the number of adjacencies over which
    link-state flooding takes place. "IS-IS Sparse Link-State Flooding" is an extension
    to the IS-IS routing protocol. It is relatively easy to understand and implement.
    It is backwards compatible. It requires no per-node configuration. It uses a distributed
    algorithm, therefor no centralized computations are required. No complex computations
    are required on each node in the network. The algorithm has no requirements for
    the network topology. It can be deployed in a redundant way to improve robustness
    and convergence-times.</p>
