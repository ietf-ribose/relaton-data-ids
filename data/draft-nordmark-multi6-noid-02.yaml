abstract:
- content: <p>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming in order
    to stimulate discussion. This proposed solution relies on verification using the
    existing DNS to prevent redirection attacks, while allowing locator rewriting
    by (border) routers, with no per-packet overhead. The solution does not introduce
    a "stack name" type of identifier, instead it ensures that all upper layer protocols
    can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing a stable IPv6
    address.</p>
