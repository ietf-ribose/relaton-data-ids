abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines methods to determine realm names for services
    being contacted by their DNS name. Currently, finding realm names is done through
    guessing or local configuration. DNS can make this process more dynamic, provided
    that DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity of resource records.</p>"
