abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes tools for the evaluation of simulation
    and\n testbed scenarios used in research on Internet congestion control\n mechanisms.
    \ We believe that research in congestion control\n mechanisms has been seriously
    hampered by the lack of good models\n underpinning analysis, simulation, and testbed
    experiments, and that\n tools for the evaluation of simulation and testbed scenarios
    can\n help in the construction of better scenarios, based on better\n underlying
    models.  One use of the tools described in this document\n is in comparing key
    characteristics of test scenarios with known\n characteristics from the diverse
    and ever-changing real world.\n Tools characterizing the aggregate traffic on
    a link include the\n distribution of per-packet round-trip times, the distribution
    of\n connection sizes, and the like.  Tools characterizing end-to-end\n paths
    include drop rates as a function of packet size and of burst\n size, the synchronization
    ratio between two end-to-end TCP flows,\n and the like.  For each characteristic,
    we describe what aspects of\n the scenario determine this characteristic, how
    the characteristic\n can affect the results of simulations and experiments for
    the\n evaluation of congestion control mechanisms, and what is known about\n this
    characteristic in the real world.  We also explain why the use\n of such tools
    can add considerable power to our understanding and\n evaluation of simulation
    and testbed scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
