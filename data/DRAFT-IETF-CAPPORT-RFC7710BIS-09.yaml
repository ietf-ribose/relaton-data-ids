abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet
    access\n   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n
    \  captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the user can do\n   until
    the user has satified the Captive Portal conditions.\n\n   This document describes
    a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and a Router\n   Advertisement (RA) option to inform
    clients that they are behind some\n   sort of captive-portal enforcement device,
    and that they will need to\n   satify the Captive Portal conditions to get Internet
    access.  It is\n   not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients
    may\n   have with captive portals; it is designed to be one component of a\n   standardized
    approach for hosts to interact with such portals.  While\n   this document defines
    how the network operator may convey the captive\n   portal API endpoint to hosts,
    the specific methods of satisfying and\n   interacting with the captive portal
    are out of scope of this\n   document.\n\n   This document replaces [RFC7710].
    \ [RFC7710] used DHCP code point\n   160.  Due to a conflict, this document specifies
    114.  Consequently,\n   this document also updates [RFC3679].\n\n   [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis.
    \ The most recent version of\n   the document, open issues, etc should all be
    available here.  The\n   authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text in square
    brackets\n   will be removed before publication. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
