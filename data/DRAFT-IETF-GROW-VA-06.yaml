abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\n
    \  stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\n   most
    costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router\n   hardware simply
    because the FIB has run out of space, and router\n   vendors must design routers
    that have adequate FIB.  FIB suppression\n   is an approach to relieving stress
    on the FIB by not loading selected\n   RIB entries into the FIB.  Virtual Aggregation
    (VA) allows ISPs to\n   shrink the FIBs of any and all routers, easily by an order
    of\n   magnitude with negligible increase in path length and load.  FIB\n   suppression
    can be deployed autonomously by an ISP without requiring\n   cooperation between
    adjacent ISPs, and can co-exist with legacy\n   routers in the ISP.\n\n\t </p>\n
