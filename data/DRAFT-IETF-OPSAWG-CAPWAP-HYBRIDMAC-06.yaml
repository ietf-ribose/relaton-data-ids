abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CAPWAP protocol defines two entities: a Wireless Transmission\n
    \  Point (WTP) and an Access Controller (AC).  The CAPWAP protocol\n   binding
    for IEEE 802.11 defines two MAC (Medium Access Control) modes\n   for IEEE 802.11
    WTP: Split and Local MAC, and describes the required\n   functionality split between
    the WTP and AC for each mode.  However,\n   in the split MAC mode, the partitioning
    of encryption/decryption\n   functions are not been clearly clearly defined.  In
    the Split MAC\n   mode description, IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified as located
    in\n   either at the AC or the WTP, with no clear way for the AC to inform\n   the
    WTP of where the encryption functionality should be located.\n   This lack of
    specification leads to interoperability issues,\n   especially when the AC and
    WTP come from different vendors.  To\n   prevent interoperability issues, this
    specification defines an IEEE\n   802.11 MAC profile message element in which
    each profile specifies an\n   unambiguous division of encryption functionality
    between the WTP and\n   AC.  The IEEE 802.11 MAC profile is used as follows: the
    WTP informs\n   the AC of the supported profiles during the discovery or join
    process\n   and the AC configures the WTP with one of the supported profiles when\n
    \  configuring the WLAN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
