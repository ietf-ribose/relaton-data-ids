abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data models for service and network management provides a\n
    \  programmatic approach for representing (virtual) services or networks\n   and
    deriving configuration information that will be forwarded to\n   network and service
    components that are used to build and deliver the\n   service.  Data Models can
    be used during various phases of the\n   service and network management life cycle,
    such as service\n   instantiation, service provisioning, optimization, monitoring,
    and\n   diagnostic.  Also, data models are are instrumental in the automation\n
    \  of network management.  They also provide closed-loop control for the\n   sake
    of adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and\n   maintenance.\n\n
    \  This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an\n   architecture
    for service and network management automation that takes\n   advantage of YANG
    modeling technologies.  This framework is drawn\n   from a network provider perspective
    irrespective of the origin of a\n   data module andcan accommodate even modules
    that are developed\n   outside the IETF.\n\n   The document aims to exemplify
    an approach that specifies the journey\n   from technology-agnostic services to
    technology-specific actions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
