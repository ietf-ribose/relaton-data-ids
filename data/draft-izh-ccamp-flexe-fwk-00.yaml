abstract:
- content: <p>Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates
    of the Ethernet PHY(s). OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was the first
    step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY rates. OIF has recently
    approved another implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] which allows complete decoupling
    of the MAC data rates and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support them. This includes
    support for (a) MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY (satisfied
    by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates which are less than the rate of
    a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple FlexE client signals carried over a
    single PHY, or over a collection of bonded PHY(s). The FlexE SHIM functions which
    bond multipe Ethernet PHY(s) to form a large "pipe" view the connectivity between
    two FlexE aware devices as a collection of multiple point-to-point links (one
    link per Ethernet PHY). These logical point-to-point links can either be direct
    links (without an intervening transport network), or realized via a Optical transport
    network. This draft catalogs the usecases that capture the FlexE deployment scenarios
    -- including the cases that include/exclude OTNs.</p>
