abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), holders of IP address
    space can become a Certification Authority (CA), optionally hosting their repository.
    They can also delegate (part of) their resources to subordinate CAs, who in turn
    may do the same. This CA hierarchy forms a tree structure. Relying Party (RP)
    software walks this tree and determines the current valid objects. An underlying
    assumption is that this tree is finite and kept at a reasonable size. This assumption
    is not guaranteed to hold. This document proposes a new Tree Hint object on RPKI
    manifests that can add constraints for use in RP processing that ensure this assumption
    holds.</p>"
