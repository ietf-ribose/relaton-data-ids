abstract:
  content: "<p>Requesting nodes typically acquire IPv6 prefixes from a prefix delegation
    service for the network. The requesting node can provision the prefix according
    to whether it acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks and/or as
    a host on behalf of its local applications. In the latter case, the requesting
    node can use portions of the delegated prefix for its own multi-addressing purposes.
    This document therefore considers prefix delegation models for both the classic
    routing and various multi-addressing use cases.</p>"
