abstract:
- content: <p>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture describes
    how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through an IPv6 or MPLS
    network using the source routing paradigm. Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end
    node to select any path without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g.,
    LDP or RSVP-TE). It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link- State
    Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). A Segment Routed Path can be derived from a
    variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration,
    or a Path Computation Element (PCE). Since, Segment Routing can be applied to
    both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane, a PCE should be able to compute SR-Path for
    both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane. This draft describes the extensions required
    for Segment Routing support for IPv6 data plane in PCEP.</p>
