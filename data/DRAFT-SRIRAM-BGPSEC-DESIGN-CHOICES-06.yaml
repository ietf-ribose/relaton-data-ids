abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document has been written to capture the design rationale
    for\n   the individual draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I-\n
    \  D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00).  It lists the decisions that were\n   made
    in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief\n   summaries of
    the arguments that aided the decision process.  A\n   similar document can be
    published in the future as the BGPSEC design\n   discussions make further progress
    and additional design\n   considerations are discussed and finalized.\n\n\t </p>\n
