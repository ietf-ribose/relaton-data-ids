abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents tcpcrypt, a TCP extension for\n   cryptographically
    protecting TCP segments.  Tcpcrypt maintains the\n   confidentiality of data transmitted
    in TCP segments against a passive\n   eavesdropper.  It can be used to protect
    already established TCP\n   connections against denial-of-service attacks involving
    injection of\n   forged RST segments or desynchronizing of sequence numbers.  Finally,\n
    \  applications that perform authentication can obtain end-to-end\n   confidentiality
    and integrity guarantees by tying authentication to\n   tcpcrypt Session ID values.\n\n
    \  The extension defines two new TCP options, CRYPT and MAC, which are\n   designed
    to provide compatible interworking with TCPs that do not\n   implement tcpcrypt.
    \ The CRYPT option allows hosts to negotiate the\n   use of tcpcrypt and establish
    shared secret encryption keys.  The MAC\n   option carries a message authentication
    code with which hosts can\n   verify the integrity of transmitted TCP segments.
    \ Tcpcrypt is\n   designed to require relatively low overhead, particularly at
    servers,\n   so as to be useful even in the case of servers accepting many TCP\n
    \  connections per second.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
