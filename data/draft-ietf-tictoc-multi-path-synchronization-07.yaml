abstract:
- content: "<p>Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based networks.
    The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed for many years, and
    the last few years have seen an increasingly rapid deployment of the Precision
    Time Protocol (PTP). As time-sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements
    are becoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization protocols
    to provide high accuracy. This memo describes a multipath approach to PTP and
    NTP over IP networks, allowing the protocols to run concurrently over multiple
    communication paths between the master and slave clocks, without modifying these
    protocols. The multipath approach can significantly contribute to clock accuracy,
    security, and fault tolerance. The multipath approach that is presented in this
    document enables backward compatibility with nodes that do not support the multipath
    functionality.</p>"
