abstract:
- content: "<p>This document mainly talks about Chinese characters and two proposed
    schemes of implemention based on [IDNREQ] and [NAMEPREP],though there are some
    differences among them.The distinction between these two schemes is the position
    of the implementation function: -- client side processing or -- server side processing</p>"
