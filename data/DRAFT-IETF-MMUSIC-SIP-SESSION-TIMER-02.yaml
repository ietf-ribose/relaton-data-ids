abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an extension to the SIP specification.
    \ This\nextension adds a new message header that is used to specify the\nduration
    of a requested session.\n \nThe session timer can be used to control the duration
    of a session\nif, for instance, one of the participants in the session wants to\nlimit
    the cost of the session.  It can also be used by stateful SIP\nProxy Servers to
    track the status of sessions for which session state\nexists on the servers. Currently
    a stateful SIP Proxy Server that is\nnot handling the media stream(s) for the
    session has no mechanism to\ndefinitively determine the state of all sessions
    for which it has state.\nWhile the SIP Specification does provide the BYE method
    for terminating\nthe session, there is no mechanism for a SIP Proxy Server to
    detect the\nend of a session when the BYE message is not sent or is lost due to\nnetwork
    problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
