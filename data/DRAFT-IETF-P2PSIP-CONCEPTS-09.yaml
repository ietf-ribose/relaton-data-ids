abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines concepts and terminology for using the Session
    Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar
    and message-routing functions are replaced by a distributed mechanism.  These
    mechanisms may be implemented using a Distributed Hash Table or other distributed
    data mechanism with similar external properties.  This document includes a high-level
    view of the functional relationships between the network elements defined herein,
    a conceptual model of operations, and an outline of the related problems addressed
    by the P2PSIP working group, the REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol,
    and the SIP usage document defined by the working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
