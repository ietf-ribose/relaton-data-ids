abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the use of Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection\n   (BFD) for multi-point networks to provide nodes that participate
    in\n   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) over shared-\n   media
    segment with the sub-second convergence of the Designated\n   Router and defines
    the extension to bootstrap point-to-multipoint BFD\n   session.  Optional extension
    to PIM-SM Hello, as defined in RFC 7761,\n   also defined in this document.\n\n\t
