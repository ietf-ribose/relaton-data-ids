abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the architecture and application scenarios
    of fused service function chain. Fused service function chain means that two or
    more service function chains are fused to become a single service function chain
    from the view of data plane and control plane. Fused service function chain is
    a expansion for service function chain. Anyhow, some mechanism or methods need
    to be used when two or more service function chains are fused to be a single service
    function chain based on architecture described in this memo.</p>"
