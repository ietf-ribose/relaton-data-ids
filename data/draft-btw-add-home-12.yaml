abstract:
- content: "<p>The document specifies new DHCP and IPv6 Router Advertisement options
    to discover encrypted DNS servers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over- TLS, DNS-over-QUIC).
    Particularly, it allows to learn an authentication domain name together with a
    list of IP addresses and a port number to reach such encrypted DNS servers. The
    discovery of DNS-over-HTTPS URI Templates is also discussed.</p>"
