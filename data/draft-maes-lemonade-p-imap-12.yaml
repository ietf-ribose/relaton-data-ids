abstract:
- content: "<p>Push Extensions to the IMAP protocol (P-IMAP) defines extensions to
    the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile setting, aimed
    at delivering extended functionality for mobile devices with limited resources.
    The first enhancement of P-IMAP is extended support to push changes actively to
    a client, rather then requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state
    changes. In addition, P-IMAP contains extensions for email filter management,
    message delivery, and maintaining up-to-date personal information. Bindings to
    specific transport are explicitly defined. Eventually P- IMAP aims at being neutral
    to the network transport neutrality. P-IMAP is a recommendation for interoperable
    intermediate implementations awaiting [LEMONADEPROFILEBIS] or the realization
    of the OMA MEM enabler using it.</p>"
