abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing
    list\n   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology\n   through
    the general discussion of topics for which no dedicated\n   mailing lists exists.
    \ As this is the most general IETF mailing list,\n   considerable latitude is
    allowed, but there are posts and topics that\n   are unsuitable for this mailing
    list.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC3005.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
