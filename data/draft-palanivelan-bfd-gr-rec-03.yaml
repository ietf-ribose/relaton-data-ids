abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd) defined in RFC5880 is comprehensive
    and has sufficient mechanisms to overcome challenges in surviving Graceful Restart
    (Planned). However, implementations with architectural limitation were found to
    influence a BFD failure, in a process intensive environment.This memo outlines
    design options to overcome the challenges, within the existing bfd framework,
    in surviving planned GracefulRestart.</p>"
