abstract:
- content: "<p>Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party Web Service
    that supports a transactional second factor confirmation mechanism that provides
    a superset of the capabilities of traditional second factor authentication schemes.
    The three parties in the protocol are Enquirer who posts a confirmation request,
    a Responder who may or may not respond to the request and the Broker where the
    requests and responses are posted.</p>"
