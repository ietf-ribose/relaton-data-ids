  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an address resolution process tailored
    to work\nunder NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)[1] over Asynchronous\nTransfer
    Mode (ATM) network with mixture of PVC environment and SVC\nenvironment. Now consider
    the case where NHRP clients, each are\nconnected to PVC network, try to communicate
    each other through SVC\nnetwork existing on the path between the PVC networks
    of each client.\n\t </p>\n      "
