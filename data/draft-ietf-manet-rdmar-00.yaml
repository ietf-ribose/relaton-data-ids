abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Relative Distance Micro-discovery AdHoc
    Routing (RDMAR) protocol for use in mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs). The protocol
    is highly adaptive, bandwidth-efficientand scaleable. A key concept in its design
    is that protocolreaction to link failures is typically localised to a very smallregion
    of the network near the change. This desirable behaviour isachieved through the
    use of a novel mechanism for route discovery,called Relative Distance Micro-discovery
    (RDM). The concept behindRDM is that a query flood can be localised by knowing
    the relativedistance (RD) between two terminals. To accomplish this, everytime
    a route search between the two terminals is triggered, aniterative algorithm calculates
    an estimate of their RD, given anaverage nodal mobility and information about
    the elapsed time sincethey last communicated and their previous RD. Based on the
    newlycalculated RD, the query flood is then localised to a limitedregion of the
    network centred at the source node of the routediscovery and with maximum propagation
    radius that equals to theestimated relative distance. This ability to localise
    query floodinginto a limited area of the network serves to increase scalabilityand
    minimise routing overhead and overall network congestion.</p>"
