abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the concept of \"segments\" to HTTP/2,
    and\n   adds a flag to the DATA frame type to allow the expression segments.\n\n
    \  A \"segment\" is a contiguous block of HTTP message data that can be\n   freely
    split apart and recombined at any time, allowing transmission\n   in multiple
    HTTP/2 frames across network segments with smaller frame\n   size limits without
    risk of permanent fragmentation when traversing\n   network segments with much
    larger limits.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
