abstract:
- content: <p>BGP has been used to distribute different types of routing and policy
    information in the network. In some cases, the information distributed may be
    only intended for one or several particular receiving BGP nodes in the network.
    BGP does not have a general mechanism for designating the receiving node of the
    routing information. This document defines a new type of BGP extended community
    called "Node Target". The mechanism and of using the Node Target extended community
    to steer BGP route distribution to particular BGP nodes is specified.</p>
