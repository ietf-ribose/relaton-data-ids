abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP [1] is an excellent vehicle for the converged network services
    of\nthe future; of that there is no doubt.  However, even in the near\nterm, SIP
    is an equally powerful solution to bridge the PSTN and VoIP\nnetworks by its application
    to the IN (Intelligent Network) services\ndomain.\nThis Internet Draft details
    our experiences of applying SIP to the\nsaid domain.  We use a SIP call controller
    to execute IN services by\nmapping IN call model states to those of the SIP protocol
    state\nmachine [2].  [2] uses the notion of call model integration [3], an\nexample
    of which is to use the IN call model as a canonical call\nmodel to map the protocol
    states of IP (Internet Protocol) based call\ncontrollers  (SIP, H.323,...) to
    those of the IN call model.\n\t </p>\n      "
