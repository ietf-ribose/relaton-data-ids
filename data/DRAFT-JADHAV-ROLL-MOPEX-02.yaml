abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes
    to have a\n   consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join
    the\n   network.  The MOP field in [RFC6550] is of 3 bits and is fast\n   depleting.
    \ This document extends the MOP for future use.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
