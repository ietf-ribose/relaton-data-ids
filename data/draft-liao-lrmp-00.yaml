abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes LRMP, the Light-weight Reliable Multicast Protocol.
    LRMP provides a minimum set of functions for end-to-end reliable network transport
    suitable for bulk data transfer to multiple receivers. LRMP is designed to work
    in heterogeneous network environments and support multiple data senders. A totally
    distributed control scheme is used for error recovery so that no prior configuration
    and no router support are required. LRMP also includes a selective feedback mechanism
    allowing to monitor the quality of service at receivers. In LRMP, flow and congestion
    control is performed based on NACK packets and congestion indication from receivers.
    Forward error correction is supported as an independent optional module.</p>"
