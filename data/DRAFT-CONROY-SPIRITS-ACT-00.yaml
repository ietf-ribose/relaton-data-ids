abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  Internet Draft has  been written at the  request of one
    \ of the\nSPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on what\nextended
    functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide.\nIt has been requested  that mapping
    \ to any specific  protocol is not\nundertaken at this  juncture. As such,  only
    'possible' functionality\nis identified and no mapping to existing protocol methods
    is given.\nThis document is only intended to  provide a basis for discussion and\nwould
    be expected to form one aspect of the requirements for SPIRITS.\nAs such the terminology
    used is deliberately and (we hope) suitably\nambiguous.\n\t </p>\n      "
