abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document establishes an architectural pattern whereby
    a remote\n   attestation could be issued for a complete set of benchmarks or\n
    \  controls that are defined and grouped by an external entity,\n   preventing
    the need to send over individual attestations for each\n   item within a benchmark
    or control framework.  This document\n   establishes a pattern to list sets of
    benchmarks and controls within\n   CWT and JWT formats for use as an Entity Attestation
    Token (EAT).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
