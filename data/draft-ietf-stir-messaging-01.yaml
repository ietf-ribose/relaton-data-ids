abstract:
  content: "<p>Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of attesting
    the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in order to prevent impersonation
    of a calling party number, which is a key enabler for illegal robocalling. Similar
    impersonation is sometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text messaging space.
    This document considers the applicability of STIR's Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT)
    and certificate issuance framework to text and multimedia messaging use cases,
    both for instant messages carried or negotiated by SIP.</p>"
