abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport
    Layer\n   Security (TLS) protocol to support certificate-less, secure\n   authentication
    using only a simple, low-entropy, password.  The\n   exchange is called TLS-PWD.
    \ The ciphersuites are all based on an\n   authentication and key exchange protocol,
    named \"dragonfly\", that is\n   resistant to off-line dictionary attack.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
