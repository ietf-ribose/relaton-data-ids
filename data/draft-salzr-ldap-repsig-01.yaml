abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments the final step of certificate issuance is publishing
    the certificate to a repository. Unfortunately, there is no way for a Certification
    Authority (CA) to have a secure application-level acknowledgement that the proper
    repository did, in fact, receive the certificate. This issue is of greater concern
    when considering the publication of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) -- if
    an adversary manages to interpose itself between the CA and its intended repository,
    then clients could end up relying on outdated revocation lists. This document
    defines a set of controls so that an LDAP client, such as a CA, can receive a
    cryptographically secure acknowledgement that an LDAP server has received a request,
    and that the integrity of the server's reply has not been compromised. Whenever
    possible, the definitions here use mechanisms and datatypes defined by the IETF
    PKIX working group. This document references RFC 2459 [RFC2459]. Knowledge of
    the RFC is required for proper implementation of this document, although it should
    be possible to understand this document without much knowledge of that RFC. It
    is expected that future versions of this document will reference 2459's successor(s).</p>"
