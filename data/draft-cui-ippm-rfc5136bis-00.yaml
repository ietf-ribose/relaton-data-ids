abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines the metric of network capacity, including
    linkcapacity aspect, router capacity aspect and path capacity aspect.RFC5136 has
    defined link capacity and path capacity, where the routerimpact is implicitly
    considered in link capacity. However, in thisdocument, router capacity is considerred
    as a separate factor of pathcapacity, no longer a factor of link capacity. This
    documentexplicitly describes the router capacity and its impact to networkcapacity,
    e.g. how to evaluate path capacity.This document is derived from RFC5136 and obsoletes
    RFC5136.</p>"
