abstract:
- content: "<p>The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest provides
    a way for many different update and boot workflows to be described by a common
    format. However, this does not provide a feedback mechanism for developers in
    the event that an update or boot fails. This specification describes a lightweight
    feedback mechanism that allows a developer in possession of a manifest to reconstruct
    the decisions made and actions performed by a manifest processor.</p>"
