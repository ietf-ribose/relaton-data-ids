abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal which allows network OAM applications
    to collect telemetry data about any user packet. Unlike similar techniques such
    as INT and in-situ OAM, the Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) does not require inserting
    telemetry data into user packets, but directly exports the telemetry data to a
    collector through separated OAM packets called postcards. Two variations of PBT
    are described in this document: one requires inserting an instruction header to
    user packets to guide the data collection and the other only marks the user packets
    to invoke the data collection. Each has its own pros and cons. Either way, the
    postcards for a single user packet are from multiple devices and need to be correlated
    at the collector, which is a unique issue pertaining to PBT. Whereas, PBT provides
    an alternative to INT and address several implementation and deployment challenges
    of the INT-based solutions.</p>"
