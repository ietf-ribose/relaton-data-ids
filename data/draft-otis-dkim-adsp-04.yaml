abstract:
  content: "\t <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) as described in [RFC4871], definesa
    domain-level authentication framework for email to permitverification of the source
    and contents of messages. This documentspecifies an adjunct mechanism to aid in
    assessing messages that lackvalid DKIM signatures for domains used in the author's
    address. Itdefines a record that can advertise the extent to which a domainsigns
    outgoing mail that is publicly exchanged on SMTP port 25, asdescribed in [RFC2821].
    Also, how other hosts can access thoserecords.Advertisements, defined by this
    document, may also increase DKIMsignature expectations for messages received by
    Mail User Agents(MUAs) or for messages which might have been exchanged over protocolsother
    than SMTP. In some circumstances, author domains may wish tohave accommodations
    for protocol failures or for mixed publicprotocol messaging not to be made.In
    addition, DKIM's identity parameters related to the author addressare decisive
    only when a corresponding DKIM key local-part templateprecludes an author address.
    DKIM in conjunction with ADSP is toprovide methods for detecting the spoofing
    of known domains, but notfor making strong assertions about the identity of the
    messageauthor.</p>"
