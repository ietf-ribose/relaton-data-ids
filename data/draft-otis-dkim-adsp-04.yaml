abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) as described in [RFC4871], defines
    a domain-level authentication framework for email to permit verification of the
    source and contents of messages. This document specifies an adjunct mechanism
    to aid in assessing messages that lack valid DKIM signatures for domains used
    in the author's address. It defines a record that can advertise the extent to
    which a domain signs outgoing mail that is publicly exchanged on SMTP port 25,
    as described in [RFC2821]. Also, how other hosts can access those records. Advertisements,
    defined by this document, may also increase DKIM signature expectations for messages
    received by Mail User Agents (MUAs) or for messages which might have been exchanged
    over protocols other than SMTP. In some circumstances, author domains may wish
    to have accommodations for protocol failures or for mixed public protocol messaging
    not to be made. In addition, DKIM's identity parameters related to the author
    address are decisive only when a corresponding DKIM key local-part template precludes
    an author address. DKIM in conjunction with ADSP is to provide methods for detecting
    the spoofing of known domains, but not for making strong assertions about the
    identity of the message author.</p>"
