abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of generic mechanisms which can
    be used\n   to set up network based Virtual Private Networks (VPN) across IP\n
    \  networks. In particular,  it describes how these mechanisms can be\n   mapped
    into a network running the Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) specification.
    \ The mechanisms described, however, can apply\n   to any type of IP network running
    various forms of IP tunneling\n   mechanisms, and are not solely restricted to
    MPLS networks.  This\n   Draft serves to introduce these generic mechanisms, which
    are part of\n   the broader VPN framework which will be described more fully in\n
    \  forthcoming Drafts.\n\t </p>\n      "
