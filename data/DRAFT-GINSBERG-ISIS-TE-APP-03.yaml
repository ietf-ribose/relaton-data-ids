abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Existing traffic engineering related link attribute advertisements\n
    \  have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  In cases\n   where
    multiple applications wish to make use of these link attributes\n   the current
    advertisements do not support application specific values\n   for a given attribute
    nor do they support indication of which\n   applications are using the advertised
    value for a given link.\n\n   This draft introduces new link attribute advertisements
    which address\n   both of these shortcomings.  It also discusses backwards\n   compatibility
    issues and how to minimize duplicate advertisements in\n   the presence of routers
    which do not support the extensions defined\n   in this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
