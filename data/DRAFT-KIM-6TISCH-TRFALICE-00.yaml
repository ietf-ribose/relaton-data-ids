abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides the method that autonomously and dynamically\n
    \  schedules TSCH slotframe based on the current traffic load. In the\n   introduction
    part, we introduce some basic knowledge on TSCH and\n   RPL. After this, we introduce
    some existing TSCH schedulers and\n   their limitations. They are classified as
    centralized, distributed,\n   and autonomous. Then, we propose a novel autonomous
    and dynamic\n   TSCH cell scheduler. With this, each node schedules its own TSCH\n
    \  slotframe and allocates additional cells based on the current\n   traffic load
    without any negotiation or traffic overhead. Since\n   they allocate additional
    cells only when needed, energy efficient\n   operation can be achieved simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\t
