abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The pursuit by major national Administrations of declared\npolicies
    of ENUM technical and administrative neutrality among\nimplementations in the
    marketplace suggest the need for a\nframework for such neutrality and a focus
    on interworking\namong them. [1] [2]  This document draws upon the ENUM Working\nGroup
    archive of discussions as well as public activities in other\nstandards forums
    and the marketplace to construct an ENUM options\nframework for facilitating neutrality.
    \ This framework includes not\nonly protocol considerations, but also various
    critical technical\nand administrative support functions such as authentication
    and\nancillary directory services.\n\t </p>\n      "
