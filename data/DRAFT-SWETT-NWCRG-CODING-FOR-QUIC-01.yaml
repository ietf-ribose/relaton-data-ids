abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document focusses on the integration of FEC coding in
    the QUIC\n   transport protocol, in order to recover from packet losses.  This\n
    \  document does not specify any FEC code but defines mechanisms to\n   negotiate
    and integrate FEC Schemes in QUIC.  By using proactive loss\n   recovery, it is
    expected to improve QUIC performance in sessions\n   impacted by packet losses.
    \ More precisely it is expected to improve\n   QUIC performance with real-time
    sessions (since FEC coding makes\n   packet loss recovery insensitive to the round
    trip time), with\n   multicast sessions (since the same repair packet can recover
    several\n   different losses at several receivers), and with multipath sessions\n
    \  (since repair packets add diversity).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
