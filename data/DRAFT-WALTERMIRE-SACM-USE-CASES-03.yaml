abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional\n
    \  capabilities, and requirements needed to provide a foundation for\n   creating
    interoperable automation tools and continuous monitoring\n   solutions that provide
    visibility into the state of assets, user\n   activities, and network behavior.
    \ Stakeholders will be able to use\n   these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant
    security and\n   operational data to understand the organizations security posture,\n
    \  quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support\n   organizational
    objectives while protecting critical information.\n   Organizations will be able
    to use these tools to augment and automate\n   information sharing activities
    to collaborate with partners to\n   identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation
    tools will be able\n   to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies
    based on\n   human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the\n
    \  overall attack surface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
