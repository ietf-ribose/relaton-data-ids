abstract:
- content: "<p>Pervasive monitoring attacks on the privacy of Internet users are of
    serious concern to both user and operator communities. RFC 7258 discusses the
    critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications and
    also recognizes that making networks unmanageable to mitigate pervasive monitoring
    is not an acceptable outcome: an appropriate balance is needed. This document
    discusses current security and network operations as well as management practices
    that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide
    protocol development in support of manageable and secure networks.</p>"
