abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes an architectural pattern whereby a remote
    attestation could be issued for a complete set of benchmarks or controls that
    are defined and grouped by an external entity, preventing the need to send over
    individual attestations for each item within a benchmark or control framework.
    This document establishes a pattern to list sets of benchmarks and controls within
    CWT and JWT formats for use as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT).</p>"
