abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching
    for\n   specific resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination\n
    \  with the HTTP GET verb.  The Extended Search specification defines\n   the
    following additional features:\n\n   o  Specification of search terms within an
    HTTP POST verb to avoid\n      accidental leakage of confidential information
    via HTTP GET URLs,\n\n   o  An optional result set representation enabling clients
    to page\n      through results in a state consistent fashion, and\n\n   o  The
    ability to search across multiple resource types (endpoints)\n      and return
    one or more resource types.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
