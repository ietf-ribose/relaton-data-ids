abstract:
- content: "<p>Current IP and MPLS OAM techniques need to be extended to permit operators
    to effectively diagnose load-balancing issues. Specifically, new ad-hoc OAM techniques
    are needed to diganose various link-bundling techniques, such as IP/MPLS Equal
    Cost Multi- Path (ECMP) and Link Aggregation Groups (LAG). In addition, these
    OAM tools should also be extended to permit performance monitoring over longer
    time durations. This document defines requirements for the next generation of
    OAM solutions.</p>"
