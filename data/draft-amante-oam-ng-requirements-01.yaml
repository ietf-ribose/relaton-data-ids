    to effectively diagnose load-balancing issues.Specifically, new ad-hoc OAM techniques
    are needed to diganosevarious link-bundling techniques, such as IP/MPLS Equal
    Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and Link Aggregation Groups (LAG). In addition, theseOAM
    tools should also be extended to permit performance monitoringover longer time
