abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF and the RFC series are trusted names, for producing high quality
    technical documents that make the Internet work better. While the success of our
    documents is variable, many of them are widely used over a long time period. As
    norms in the outside world change, our documents need to remain relevant and accessible
    to future generations of those working on the internet, everywhere in the world.
    This longevity of our documents, and the impossibility of predicting the future,
    implies that we should be conservative in the language that we send. Effective
    language expresses our intent with clarity, and without distraction. This document
    describes a mechanism for increasing awareness of words that are likely to cause
    distraction to readers, both now and in the future, while maintaining document
    clarity and not interfering with our mission.</p>"
