abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The registration and use of interface types (\"ifType\" values)\n
    \  predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules,\n   and
    so confusion has arisen about the interface type allocation\n   process.  Tunnel
    types were then added later, with the same\n   requirements and allocation policy
    as interface types.  This document\n   provides updated guidelines for the definition
    of new interface types\n   and tunnel types, for consideration by those who are
    defining,\n   registering, or evaluating those definitions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
