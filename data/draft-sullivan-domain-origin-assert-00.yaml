abstract:
- content: "<p>Some clients on the Internet make inferences about the administrative
    relationships among servers on the Internet based on the domain names of those
    servers. Examples include decisions about acceptance of cookies and about cross-document
    information sharing in ECMAScript DOM. Perhaps unfortunately, real administrative
    boundaries in the DNS are not possible to detect, and therefore these inferences
    can go wrong in several ways. Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale.
    The solution to this is to provide a way to make an explicit assertion about the
    relationships between different domain names.</p>"
