abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern the behavior
    of all IETF participants with respect to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) about
    which they might reasonably be aware. The IETF takes conformance to these IPR
    policies very seriously. However, there has been some ambiguity as to what the
    appropriate sanctions are for the violation of these policies, and how and by
    whom those sanctions are to be applied. This document discusses these issues and
    provides a suite of potential actions that can be taken within the IETF community
    in cases related to patents. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
