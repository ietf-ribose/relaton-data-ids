abstract:
  content: "\t <t>LoST maps service identifiers and location information to servicecontact
    URIs. If a LoST client wants to discover available servicesfor a particular location,
    it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt;query to the LoST server. However,
    the response from the LoST serverdoes not provide information about the geographical
    region for whichthe returned service list is valid. Therefore, this documentproposes
    a ServiceListBoundary to assist the client to not miss achange in available services
    when moving.</p>"
