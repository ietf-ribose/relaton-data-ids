abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The encapsulation of IP packet headers in tunnels is used in many\nplaces,
    including IPsec and IP in IP [RFC2003].  Explicit Congestion\nNotification (ECN)
    is an experimental addition to the IP architecture\nthat uses the ECN field in
    the IP header to provide an indication of\nthe onset of congestion to applications.
    \ ECN provides this\ncongestion indication to enable end-node adaptation to network\nconditions
    without the use of dropped packets [RFC 2481].  Currently,\nthe ECN specification
    does not accommodate the constraints imposed by\nsome of these pre-existing specifications
    for tunnels.  This document\nconsiders issues related to interactions between
    ECN and IP tunnels,\nand proposes two alternative solutions\n\t </p>\n      "
