abstract:
- content: "<p>RPS Security [2] requires certain RPSL [1] objects in the IRR to be
    hierarchically delegated. The set of objects that are at the root of this hierarchy
    needs to be created and digitally signed by ICANN. This paper presents these seed
    objects and lists operations required from ICANN.</p>"
