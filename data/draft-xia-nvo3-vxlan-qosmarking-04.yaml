abstract:
- content: "<p>Overlay networks such as The Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network
    enable multiple tenants to operate in a data center. Each tenant needs to be assigned
    a priority group to prioritize their traffic using tenant based quality of service
    marking. Also, cloud carriers wish to use quality of service to differentiate
    different applications, i.e. legacy, traffic based marking. For these purposes,
    Quality of Service bits are assigned in the Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network
    outer Ethernet header. How these bits are assigned and are processed in the network
    are explained in detail. Also the document presents a quality of service framework
    for overlay networks such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network.</p>"
