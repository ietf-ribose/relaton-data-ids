abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a mechanism for information exchange between an
    application and the network. The information provided from the application to
    the network MAY be used by a network element in the path to modify its behavior
    to improve application quality of experience (QoE). Likewise, the information
    provided by the network to the application MAY be used by the application to modify
    its behavior to optimize for QoE. The information provided from the application
    to the network can also be useful for middleboxes that are responsible for security
    at edges of network (e.g. firewalls) or other middleboxes in determining how to
    treat the packets delivered from this application.</p>"
