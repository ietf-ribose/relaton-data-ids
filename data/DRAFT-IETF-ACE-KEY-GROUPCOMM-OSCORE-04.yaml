abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an application profile of the ACE\n
    \  framework for Authentication and Authorization, to request and\n   provision
    keying material in group communication scenarios that are\n   based on CoAP and
    secured with Group Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful Environments (OSCORE).
    \ This application profile delegates\n   the authentication and authorization
    of Clients that join an OSCORE\n   group through a Resource Server acting as Group
    Manager for that\n   group.  This application profile leverages protocol-specific\n
    \  transport profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, server\n   authentication
    and proof-of-possession for a key owned by the Client\n   and bound to an OAuth
    2.0 access token.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
