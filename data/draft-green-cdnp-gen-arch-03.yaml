abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting ContentNetworks,
    variously called 'Content Peering' or 'ContentInternetworking'. We present the
    general architecture and corebuilding blocks used in the internetworking of Content
    Networks. The scope of this work is limited to external interconnections withContent
    Networks and does not address internal mechanisms usedwithin Content Networks,
    which for the purpose of the document areconsidered to be black boxes. This work
    establishes an abstractarchitectural framework to be used in the development of
    protocols,interfaces, and system models for standardized ContentInternetworking.</p>"
