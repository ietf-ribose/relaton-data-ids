abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the Delay and Disruption\n
    \  Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol specification [RFC5050]\n   which
    describes a protocol that enables the transfer of relatively\n   large Data Objects
    over disrupted networks.  The Erasure Coding\n   Extension is a mechanism that
    extends the ability of the existing DTN\n   bundle fragmentation mechanism to
    handle situations where bundles\n   have a high probability of being dropped.
    \ An example use case is a\n   situation where no communication contact period
    will ever be long\n   enough to send the whole Data Object.  In this case the
    object must\n   be partitioned into smaller chunks and these chunks are sent in\n
    \  multiple bundles.  The Erasure Coding Extension provides a recovery\n   mechanism
    that allows many of these bundles to be dropped and still\n   allow the whole
    Data Object to be successfully sent.\n\n   This document describes an Erasure
    Coding Extension Block and a\n   framework for integrating Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) into the\n   bundle protocol.  The Erasure Coding Extension is designed
    to support\n   multiple FEC schemes and content object types.  This is the framework\n
    \  document for a series of documents about erasure coding for DTN.\n   Companion
    documents describe specific FEC schemes [RandBinary] and\n   specific Data Object
    types [EcObjects].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
