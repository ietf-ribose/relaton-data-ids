abstract:
- content: "<p>YANG enables to compile a set of consistent vendor-neutral data models
    for optical networks and components based on actual operational needs emerging
    from heterogeneous use cases. A YANG model has been also proposed to describe
    finite state machine to program network elements that are modeled with YANG. This
    document augments the more generic YANG model for finite state machine [I-D.sambo-netmod-yang-fsm],
    in order to pre-instruct an optical transponder on the actions to be performed
    (e.g., code adaptation) in case some events, such as physical layer degradations,
    occur.</p>"
