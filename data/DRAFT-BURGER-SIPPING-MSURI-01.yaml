abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Application Servers, SIP Proxies, and SoftSwitches (a.k.a. Media
    \nGateway Controllers) act as SIP [2] User Agents to control the media \nprocessing
    capabilities of media servers.  The SIP Request URI \nidentifies the desired service
    and provides a context for the media \nserver to interpret the SIP message.  This
    document describes a \nstandard SIP addressing mechanism to address specific services.
    \ \nBecause of SIP's flexibility, the existing protocol accommodates \nthese services.
    \ This document proposes a standard URI scheme for \nimportant media services
    such as announcements and conferencing.\n\t </p>\n      "
