abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an optional extension to the OSPF protocol,\n
    \  to represent the metric on a multi-access network as two parts: the\n   metric
    from a router to the network, and the metric from the network\n   to the router.
    \ The router to router metric would be the sum of the\n   two.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
