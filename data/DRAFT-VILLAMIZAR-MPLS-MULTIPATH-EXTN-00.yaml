abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Extensions to OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE, and RSVP-TE are defined in
    support of\n   carrying LSP with strict packet ordering requirements over multipath\n
    \  and and carrying LSP with strict packet ordering requirements within\n   LSP
    without violating requirements to maintain packet ordering.  LSP\n   with strict
    packet ordering requirements include MPLS-TP LSP.\n\n   OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE extensions
    defined here indicate node and link\n   capability regarding support for ordered
    aggregates of traffic,\n   multipath traffic distribution, and abilities to support
    multipath\n   load distribution differently per LSP.\n\n   RSVP-TE extensions
    either identifies an LSP as requiring strict\n   packet order, or identifies an
    LSP as carrying one or more LSP that\n   requires strict packet order further
    down in the label stack, or\n   identifies an LSP as having no restrictions on
    packet ordering except\n   the restriction to avoid reordering microflows.  In
    addition an\n   extension indicates whether the first nibble of payload will reliably\n
    \  indicate whether payload is IPv4, IPv6, or other type of payload,\n   most
    notably pseudowire using a pseudowire control word.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
