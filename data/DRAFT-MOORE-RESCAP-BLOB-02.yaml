abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the Binary Low-Overhead Block (BLOB) protocol
    for\non-the-wire presentation of data in the context of higher-level\nprotocols.
    \ BLOB is designed to encode and decode data with low overhead\non most CPUs,
    to be reasonably space-efficient, and for its\nrepresentation to be sufficiently
    precise that it is suitable as a\ncanonical format for digital signatures.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
