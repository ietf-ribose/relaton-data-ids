abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DIAMETER base protocol defines message integrity and AVP\nencryption
    using symmetric transforms to secure the communication\nbetween two DIAMETER nodes.
    The base protocol also defines a DIAMETER\nproxy server, that forwards requests
    to other servers when it detects\nthat a given request cannot be satisfied locally.\nThe
    ROAMOPS Working Group has defined a requirement that allows for\nthe DIAMETER
    servers communicating through the proxy to be able to\nprovide for end-to-end
    AVP integrity and confidentiality, making it\ndifficult for the proxy to be able
    to modify, and/or be able to view\nsensitive information, within the message.
    The Mobile-IP and NASREQ\nWorking Groups have stated that strong authentication
    is a\nrequirement for AAA data, such as accounting records, for the\npurposes
    of non-repudiation.\nThis DIAMETER extension specifies how strong AVP authentication,\nintegrity
    and encryption can be done using asymmetric transforms, by\nencapsulating Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) data into DIAMETER\nAVPs. The CMS data can also be used to
    carry X.509 certificates.\n\t </p>\n      "
