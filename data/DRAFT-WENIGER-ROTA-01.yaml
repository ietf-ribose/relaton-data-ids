abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IPv6 in route optimization mode reveals mobile node's
    care-of\n   address to the correspondent node and hence cannot provide location\n
    \  privacy.  In contrast, Mobile IPv6 in bi-directional tunneling mode\n   can
    provide location privacy, but the resulting route may be far from\n   optimal,
    especially when correspondent node is mobile as well.  This\n   may be an issue
    for conversational mobile-to-mobile communication\n   scenarios, e.g., using VoIP.
    \ The draft discusses the problem of\n   providing both location privacy and route
    optimization with Mobile\n   IPv6 and describes a solution in terms of an optional
    extension to\n   Mobile IPv6.  The basic idea is that mobile nodes switch the
    reverse\n   tunnel endpoint in bi-directional tunneling mode from their home\n
    \  agent to a so-called tunneling agent in an on-demand manner.  To\n   ensure
    location privacy, the tunneling agent selection is done by the\n   home agents.
    \ The solution does not require the mobile node to change\n   its home address
    and does not rely on visited network support.\n\t </p>\n      "
