abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes network architecture based on recursiveaddressing.
    The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomoussites, each being a collection
    of nodes. Each site is named by asite address drawn from a global number space
    while each node isnamed by a node address drawn from a number space local to each
    site.Routing among sites depends solely on site addresses while thatwithin each
    site on node addresses. Flat routing to render inherentmobility as well as mapped
    routing to additionally cope with tablesize are proposed. The model can recursively
    repeat itself bothoutwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability,
    forexample, to inter-planetary as well as body area networks.</p>"
