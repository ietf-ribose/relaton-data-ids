abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of privacy considerations
    related\n   to user IP addresses.  It includes an analysis of some current use\n
    \  cases for tracking of user IP addresses, mainly in the context of\n   anti-abuse.
    \ It discusses the privacy issues associated with such\n   tracking and provides
    input on mechanisms to improve the privacy of\n   this existing model.  It then
    captures requirements for proposed\n   'replacement signals' for IP addresses
    from this analysis.  In\n   addition, existing and under-development techniques
    are evaluated for\n   fulfilling these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
