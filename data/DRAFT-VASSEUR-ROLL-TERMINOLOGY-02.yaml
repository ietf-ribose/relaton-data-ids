abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing\nrequirements
    and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and\nLossy Networks (LLN).
    \ A LLN is typically composed of many embedded\ndevices with limited power, memory,
    and processing resources\ninterconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide
    scope of\napplication areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building\nautomation
    (e.g.  Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting,\naccess control, fire),
    connected home, healthcare, environmental\nmonitoring, urban sensor networks,
    energy management, assets\ntracking, refrigeration.Requirements Language\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
