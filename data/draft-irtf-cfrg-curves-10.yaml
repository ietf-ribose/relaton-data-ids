abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer
    high practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer
    Security (TLS). These curves are intended to operate at the ~128-bit and ~224-bit
    security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based on a list
    of required properties.</p>"
