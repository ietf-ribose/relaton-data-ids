abstract:
- content: "<p>In Real-time multimedia applications using multiple media streams in
    point to point and multipoint calls can benefit from options that will enable
    them to pause and resume media streams as well as to indicate a mute state. This
    document describes the difference between pause and mute and describes how to
    provide this required functionality. This document updates RFC5104.</p>"
