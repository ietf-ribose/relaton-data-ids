abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) include
    several\n   techniques that improve the reliability and the security of data\n
    \  transfers.  In this document we propose Multipath TLS (MPTLS), a\n   tighter
    coupling between TLS and Multipath TCP that provides improved\n   security and
    reliability in the presence of adversaries.  MPTLS would\n   the resilience of
    existing TLS applications to attacks.  It could\n   also serve as a basis for
    the TCP extension that is being discussed\n   within the TCPINC working group
    to provide unauthenticated encryption\n   and integrity protection of TCP streams.\n\n\t
