abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SIP working group has been grappling with a variety of very\ndifficult
    problems lately. These include early media, coupling of\nresource reservation
    and call signaling, and the so-called\nHeterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem
    (HERFP). Additional\nproblems being considered include supporting capability negotiation\nfor
    indicating support any one of one-of-N codecs, upgrading the\nsecurity on RTP
    streams, and demultiplexing media from a forked\nINVITE. In this document, we
    present a unified view of all of these\nproblems, and present a unified solution
    that solves all of them in\nthe same way.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
