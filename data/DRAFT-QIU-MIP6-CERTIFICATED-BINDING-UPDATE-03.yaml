abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a comprehensive security solution for
    mobile \n   IPv6 networks including secure binding update, secure fast handover,
    \n   user authentication and session key management for data security. In \n   our
    proposal, one of the home agent's functions is to act as \n   security proxy for
    its mobile nodes. The authentication is based on \n   the home agent's certificate
    and the secret session keys are \n   generated by strong cryptosystems. Our proposal
    avoids many security \n   obstacles in the Return Routability protocol and provides
    a simple, \n   integrated and efficient security solution for mobile communication.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
