abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
    and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements to be met
    in the context of delivery of services (e.g. Voice over IP or IP TV) which are
    to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure. The CPP defines the set of IP transfer
    parameters to be supported by the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together
    with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate performance
    metrics such as one-way delay, one-way delay variation are used to characterize
    an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be
    captured in the CPP.</p>"
