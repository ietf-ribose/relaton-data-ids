abstract:
  content: "<p>Electronic signatures have a limited lifespan with respect to the time
    period that they can be validated and determined to be authentic. The Signature
    Validation Token (SVT) defined in this specification provides evidence that asserts
    the validity of an electronic signature. The SVT is provided by a trusted authority,
    which asserts that a particular signature was successfully validated according
    to defined procedures at a certain time. Any future validation of that electronic
    signature can be satisfied by validating the SVT without any need to also validate
    the original electronic signature or the associated digital certificates. SVT
    supports electronic signatures in CMS, XML, and PDF documents.</p>"
