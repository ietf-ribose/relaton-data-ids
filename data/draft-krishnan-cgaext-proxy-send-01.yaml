abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securingNeighbor
    Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats. Asspecified today, SEND assumes
    that the node advertising an address isthe owner of the address and is in possession
    of the private key usedto generate the digital signature on the message. This
    means thatthe Proxy ND signaling initiated by nodes that do not possessknowledge
    of the address owner's private key cannot be secured usingSEND. This document
    extends the current SEND specification withsupport for Proxy ND, the Secure Proxy
    ND Support for SEND.</p>"
