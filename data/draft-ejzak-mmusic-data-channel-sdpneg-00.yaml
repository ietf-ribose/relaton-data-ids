abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the
    concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might
    be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols. Data channel setup
    can be done using either the in-band WebRTC Data Channel protocol or some external
    (in-band or out-of-band) negotiation. This document specifies how the SDP offer/answer
    exchange can be used to achieve such an external negotiation. Even though data
    channels are designed for RTCWeb use initially they may be used by other protocols
    like, but not limited to, the CLUE protocol. This document is intended to be used
    whereever data channels are used.</p>"
