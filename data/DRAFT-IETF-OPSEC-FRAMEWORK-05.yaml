abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines work done and documents produced by
    the\n   Operational Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group.  The goal of\n
    \  the working group is to codify knowledge gained through operational\n   experience
    about feature sets that are needed to securely deploy and\n   operate managed
    network elements providing transit services at the\n   data link and IP layers.\n\n
    \  The intent is to provide clear, concise documentation of capabilities\n   necessary
    for operating networks securely, to assist network\n   operators in communicating
    their requirements to vendors, and to\n   provide vendors with input that is useful
    for building more secure\n   devices.  The working group produced a list of capabilities\n
    \  appropriate for large Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Enterprise\n   Networks.
    \ This work is intended to refine [RFC3871].\n\n   This document also provides
    guidance for the creation of profile\n   documents which are lists of security
    features needed in specific\n   operating environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
