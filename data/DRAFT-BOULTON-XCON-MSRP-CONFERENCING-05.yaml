abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document \"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized\n
    \  Conferencing\" defines a centralized conference as both signaling and\n   protocol
    agnostic.  The primary examples within this framework focus\n   on audio and video
    as the media types for the session.  This document\n   describes the mechanisms,
    in the context of this centralized\n   conferencing framework, when using instant
    messaging sessions as the\n   media.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
