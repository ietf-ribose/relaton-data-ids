abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The mailing list command specification and identification header\n
    \  fields are a set of structured fields to be added to email messages\n   sent
    by email distribution lists.  Command header fields typically\n   contain URIs
    (usually including \"mailto\") locating the relevant\n   information or performing
    the command directly.  The three core\n   command header fields described in this
    document are List-Help, List-\n   Subscribe, and List-Unsubscribe.\n\n   There
    are three other header fields described here which, although\n   not as widely
    applicable, will have utility for a sufficient number\n   of mailing lists to
    justify their formalization here.  These are\n   List-Post, List-Owner and List-Archive.\n\n
    \  By including these header fields, mailing list managers can make it\n   possible
    for mail user agents to provide automated tools for users to\n   perform list
    functions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
