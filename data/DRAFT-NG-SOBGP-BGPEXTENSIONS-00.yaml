abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing
    systems\n   within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway\n
    \  Protocol [BGP], which is used to provide routing information between\n   autonomous
    systems. This document proposes a system where the origin\n   of any advertisement
    within BGP can be verified and authenticated,\n   preventing the advertisement
    of prefix blocks by unauthorized\n   networks, verifying that the final destination
    in the path is\n   actually within the autonomous system to which the packets
    are being\n   routed, and proving the validity of the AS Path contained in the\n
    \  update.\n\t </p>\n      "
