abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses some security issues associated with IP
    over\n   ATM operation. RFC1577 defines the Classic IP model for sending IP\n
    \  traffic over ATM. However, security issues were not addressed in the\n   standard.
    Since internet is an open architecture, security measures\n   to protect network
    integrity are essential for normal operation. The\n   security loopholes in the
    current RFC 1577 model are analyzed and\n   discussed. Possible solutions are
    proposed.\n\t </p>\n      "
