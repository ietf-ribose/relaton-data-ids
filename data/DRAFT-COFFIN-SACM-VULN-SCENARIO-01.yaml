abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a core narrative that walks through
    an\n   automated enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario.  It is\n   aligned
    with the SACM use cases and begins with an enterprise\n   ingesting vulnerability
    description data, followed by identifying\n   endpoints on the network and collecting
    and storing information about\n   them to enable posture assessment, and finally
    ends with assessing\n   these endpoints against the vulnerability description
    data to\n   determine which ones are affected.  Processes that specifically\n
    \  overlap between this scenario and SACM use cases will be noted where\n   applicable.
    \ Specifically, the relationship between this document and\n   the SACM use case
    building block capabilities and the usage scenarios\n   will be covered.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
