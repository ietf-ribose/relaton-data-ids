abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism whereby,  in  response  to
    \ a  AAA\nrequest, a AAA server may refer a client to another server, which will\nthen
    directly handle requests from that client.  This is  in  contrast\nto  a  proxy
    \ mechanism, where one AAA server acts as an intermediary,\ncommunicating with
    another AAA server on behalf of the AAA client.  An\nimplementation  of  this
    \ mechanism  for  Dial Access AAA is presented\nusing the RADIUS protocol.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
