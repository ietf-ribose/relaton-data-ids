abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
    established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in
    ways that required changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this
    RFC is to document and describe the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version
    2.0 (IASA 2.0). It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration
    LLC Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society
    in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process. It also
    defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF LLC Board.\n\n This document
    obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.\n\t </p>\n      "
