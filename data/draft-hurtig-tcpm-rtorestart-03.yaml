abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the TCP and
    SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when a connection's
    amount of outstanding data is small. The modification allows the transport to
    restart its retransmission timer more aggressively in situations where fast retransmit
    cannot be used. This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections
    that are short-lived or application-limited.</p>"
