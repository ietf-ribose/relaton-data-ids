abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines a method that may be used by authors of
    successor\n(or canceling) articles to authenticate their authorship of the original\narticle.\n
    \nAs a proto-article article passes through various agents they may include\nthe
    hash of a secret string in a Cancel-Key header. Later if they wish to\nuse a standard
    mechanism to remove the original article (eg Cancel or\nSupersede) they can include
    this string in the Cancel-Lock header to\nverify that they are entitled to perform
    this operation.\n \nFamiliarity with the current News Article Format draft [ARTICLE]
    is\nassumed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
