abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>         Fax over IP is currently using SMTP, i.e. the fax is
    sent\n         as an e-mail.  It would be desireable to support a fax\n         delivery
    that can return status of the transmission in\n         real time, such as whether
    the phone number or address\n         was correct, whether the remote side was
    busy, etc. The\n         ITU is standardizing a protocol for transferring real\n
    \        time fax over IP, T.38.  This standard is meant to be\n         used
    with the H.323 standard, but it is also possible to\n         use it together
    with SIP, provided that SDP is extended\n         to support the necessary parameters.
    This document\n         defines extensions to SDP to support the use of T.38 for\n
    \        real-time fax.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
