abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) inOSPFv3
    [RFC2740]). These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] aremeant to instantiate
    distinct OSPFv3 instances to convey routinginformation which is specific to IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 address AddressFamily [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]. The goal of runningseparate
    instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 is to distinguish the nativeIPv6 routing topology
    from the IPv4 routing topology. Separateinstances are also meant to prevent any
    overload of the native IPv6routing tables by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes. This isolation
    ismotivated also from an operational perspective to enforce specificrouting policies
    for each topology.</p>"
