abstract:
- content: "<p>In packet transport networks, there are requirements where reverse
    unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its
    forward unidirectional LSP. The bidirectional LSP needs to maintain co-routed-ness
    even after a failure event in the network. This document describes RSVP signaling
    to unambiguously bind two co- routed point-to-point LSPs into an associated co-routed
    bidirectional LSP. Fast-reroute procedures are defined to ensure that the traffic
    flows on the co-routed path after a failure event.</p>"
