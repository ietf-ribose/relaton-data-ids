abstract:
- content: "<p>The offer/answer model for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) assumes
    that endpoints somehow establish the Quality of Service (QoS) required for the
    media streams they establish. Endpoints in closed environments typically agree
    out-of-band (e.g., using configuration information) regarding which QoS mechanism
    to use. However, on the Internet, there is more than one QoS service available.
    Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism to negotiate which QoS mechanism
    to use for a particular media stream. This document defines such a mechanism.
