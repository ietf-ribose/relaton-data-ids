abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an incremental approach towards deploying\n
    \  HNCP and routing protocols in home networks.  Its aim is to provide a\n   minimal,
    forward-compatible transitional extension to HNCP to promote\n   testing, deployment
    and adoption of homenet technology while the IGP\n   decision and standardization
    process is not yet finalized.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
