abstract:
  content: "<p>With the proliferation of IP based internetworking services to massbusiness
    and consumer markets carriers are faced with operationalchallenges in an extent
    never before experienced in previous LAN MANor WAN environments. To accommodate
    these new internetworking envi-ronments, carrier workflow management applications
    for service Ful-fillment, Assurance, and Billing (FAB) need to undergo major a
    tran-sition. In essence applications need to transition from being pertechnology
    centric to being service centric, as historic correspon-dence between technology
    and service is no longer true. Applicationsdo not need to change in nature, since
    they still need to supportinventory, CRM, order and other workflows. However,
    applicationsneed to include a service centric aspect as basis for these work-flows.Service
    Centric solutions can be shared by a wide range of managementand workflow applications,
    rather than be re-invented by each one.Service Centric Management solutions must
    be distributed in order tocope with the massive scale and complexity challenges
    of the underly-ing networks. Service Centric Management Protocol (SCMP) and distri-bution
    should be standardized to facilitate multi-vendor interoper-ability in this emerging
    space, allow for potential future embeddingwithin NE, and to allow for Service
    Centric Management primitives toextend across Inter Carrier Interfaces (ICI) and
    inner carrier regu-latory bounds.</p>"
