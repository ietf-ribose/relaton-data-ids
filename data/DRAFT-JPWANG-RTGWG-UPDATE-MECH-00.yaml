abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When a connection request comes in a mesh optical network, the
    \nrouters automatically choose the suitable routing paths and \nwavelength to
    it according to the network topology and link state\ninformation saved in its
    global link state database. Because some \nof these wavelengths may be released
    or occupied at any time, the \nglobal state database is always out of date and
    needed by update by \nsome an update policy. A suitable link state update policy
    is \ncritical, since that a high frequency update polity imposes heavy \nburden
    on network, while a low frequency one would increase the \ninaccurate of the global
    link state database. In this paper, we \npropose a link state update policy, named
    EA-HD policy, which \nconsiders two index of a link, one is the Hamming distance
    between \nthe local link state database and the global link state database, \nand
    another is the used ratio of its wavelengths. The proposed \nupdate policy gets
    a trade-off between the accurate of link state \ninformation and its update cost.
    Simulation proves that our scheme \nachieve a good performance in traffic blocking
    probability while \nmaintaining moderate volume of update traffic.\n\t </p>\n
