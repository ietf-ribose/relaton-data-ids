abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo acknowledges the change of scale in network and people\n
    \  centricities within the whole digital ecosystem. It shows how the\n   Internet
    technology can sustain the resulting network and societal\n   effects in scaling
    itself from the end to end Internet to a fringe to\n   fringe fully optional and
    compatible Internet+ which strictly\n   conforms to the Internet architecture
    and RFCs. It introduces the\n   Internet+ architectural framework and the IUTF
    to document it. It\n   explores a transition that can be seamlessly immediate
    and will\n   probably start a complete review and extension of the Internet\n
    \  schemas towards the semiotic Internet (Intersem).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
