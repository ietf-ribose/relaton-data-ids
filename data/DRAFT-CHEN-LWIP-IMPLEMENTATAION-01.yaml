abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Since small devices such as sensors are often required to be\nphysically
    small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internet\nprotocols will have
    to deal with having limited computing resources\nand memory.  This report describes
    the design and implementation of a\nsmall TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small
    enough to be used in\nminimal systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
