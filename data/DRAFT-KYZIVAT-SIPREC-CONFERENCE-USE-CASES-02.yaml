abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current work of SIPREC will soon finish.  As conferences
    are the\n   key requirement for some environments, it is worth to explore several\n
    \  extensions and additional functionality to support multimedia\n   conference
    recording.  SIPREC is not sufficient to record all the\n   conference sessions
    via certain interactive media channels, like\n   multi-user chat or screen sharing.\n\n
    \  This draft tries to show the use cases for multimedia conference\n   recording
    and the requirements for how to work well under SIPREC\n   mechanism.  The requirements
    ask for extensions to SIP that will\n   manage delivery of RTP media sessions,
    including content media\n   defined by [RFC4796] , and MSRP media sessions to
    a recording device.\n   The recorded media sessions are all SIP-based.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
