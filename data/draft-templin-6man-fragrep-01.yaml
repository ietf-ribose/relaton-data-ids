abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) provides a fragmentation and reassembly
    service for end systems allowing for the transmission of packets that exceed the
    path MTU. However, loss of just a single fragment requires retransmission of the
    original packet in its entirety, with the potential for devastating effects on
    performance. This document specifies an IPv6 fragment retransmission scheme that
    matches the loss unit to the retransmission unit.</p>"
