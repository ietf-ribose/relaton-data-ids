abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes procedures that enable a router to populateits
    Traffic Engineering Database (TED), with local addresses of otherrouters, that
    are not advertised in IS-IS TE extensions. The onlyaddresses belonging to a router
    that are advertised in IS-IS TE LSAsare the router's local addresses on links
    enabled for TE and theRouter ID. The described procedures enable a router to computetraffic
    engineered MPLS LSPs to a given router's loopback and non-TEcapable interface
    addresses.</p>"
