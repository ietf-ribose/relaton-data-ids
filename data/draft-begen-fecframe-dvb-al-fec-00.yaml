abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the Application-layer Forward ErrorCorrection
    (FEC) protocol that was developed by the Digital VideoBroadcasting (DVB) consortium
    for the protection of media streamsover IP networks. The DVB AL-FEC protocol uses
    two layers for FECprotection. The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleavedparity
    code. The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptorcode. Since both of
    these codes have already been specified inseparate documents, the current document
    does not define the detailsof these codes but provides the references to the respectivespecifications.
    By offering a layered approach, the DVB AL-FECoffers a good protection against
    both bursty and random packet lossesat a cost of decent complexity.</p>"
