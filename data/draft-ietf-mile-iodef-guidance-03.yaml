abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a
    data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly
    exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
    security incidents. Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options
    that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging
    for implementers to develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for incident sharing.
    This document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers. It will also address
    how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how
    IODEF is being used so far.The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption
    by vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by Computer
    Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.</p>"
