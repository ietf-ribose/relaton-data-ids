abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX
    \ntype devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based \nAddress of
    Records, using the GIN mechanism defined in [draft-gin].  \nTwo other drafts,
    [draft-olive] and [draft-glass], propose the same \nfor non-E.164-based AoRs.
    \ This document defines a means by which \nthe IP-PBX can verify the resolution
    entries in the SSP for open-\nended or full AoRs of any GIN-based mechanism, using
    a new Event-\nPackage named \"vermouth\".\n\t </p>\n      "
