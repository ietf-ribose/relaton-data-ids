abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and is used in basic services including both the\n   cost
    map service and the endpoint cost service.\n\n   Different applications may use
    different cost metrics, but the ALTO\n   base protocol documents only one single
    cost metric, i.e., the\n   generic \"routingcost\" metric; see Sec. 14.2 of ALTO
    base\n   specification [RFC7285].  Hence, if the resource consumer of an\n   application
    prefers a resource provider that offers low-delay\n   delivery to the resource
    consumer, the base protocol does not define\n   the cost metric to be used.\n\n
    \  ALTO cost metrics can be generic metrics and this document focuses on\n   network
    performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet\n   loss, hop count,
    and bandwidth.  These metrics can be derived and\n   aggregated from routing protocols
    with different granularity and\n   scope, such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE,
    or from end-to-end\n   traffic management tools.  These metrics may then be exposed
    by an\n   ALTO Server to allow applications to determine \"where\" to connect\n
    \  based on network performance criteria.  Additional cost metrics may\n   be
    documented in other documents.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
