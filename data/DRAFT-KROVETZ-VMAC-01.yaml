abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification describes how to generate an authentication
    tag\n   using the VMAC message authentication algorithm.  VMAC is designed to\n
    \  have exceptional performance in software on 64-bit CPU architectures\n   while
    still performing well on 32-bit architectures.  Measured speeds\n   are as fast
    as one-half CPU cycle per byte (cpb) on 64-bit\n   architectures, under five cpb
    on desktop 32-bit processors, and\n   around ten cpb on embedded 32-bit architectures.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
