abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various circumstances in which it is highly desirable for
    a Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover
    a set of Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), along with some of information that
    can be used for PCE selection. When the PCE is an LSR participating to the IGP,
    or even a server participating passively to the IGP, a simple and efficient way
    for PCE discovery consists of relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose this document
    defines OSPF and ISIS extensions for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information
    within an IGP area or within the entire routing domain.</p>"
