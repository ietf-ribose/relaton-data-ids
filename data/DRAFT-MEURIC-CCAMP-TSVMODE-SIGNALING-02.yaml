abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ReSource Reservation Protocol with Traffic Engineering
    extensions\n   (RSVP-TE) allows to carry optical information so as to set up\n
    \  channels over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks between\n   a
    pair of transceivers.  Nowadays, there are many transceivers that\n   not only
    support tunable lasers, but also multiple modulation\n   formats.  This memo leverages
    the Generalized Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching protocol extensions to support
    the signaling of the\n   associated information as a \"mode\" parameter within
    a \"transceiver\n   type\" context.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
