abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires that the
    original data does not change during serialization or parsing. By applying the
    rules defined by the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), data provided in JSON
    [RFC8259] format can be exchanged "as is", while still being usable by secure
    cryptographic operations. JCS achieves this by building on the strict serialization
    formats for JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript [ES6], constraining JSON data
    to the I-JSON [RFC7493] subset, and through a platform independent property sorting
    scheme. The intended audiences of this document are JSON tool vendors, as well
    as designers of JSON based cryptographic solutions.</p>
