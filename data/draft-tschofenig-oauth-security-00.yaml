abstract:
- content: <p>The OAuth working group has finished work on the OAuth 2.0 core protocol
    as well as the Bearer Token specification. The Bearer Token is a TLS-based solution
    for ensuring that neither the interaction with the Authorization Server (when
    requesting a token) nor the interaction with the Resource Server (for accessing
    a protected resource) leads to token leakage. There has, however, always been
    the desire to develop a security solution that is "better" than Bearer Tokens
    (or at least different) where the Client needs to show possession of some keying
    material when accessing a Resource Server. This document tries to capture the
    discussion and to come up with requirements to process the work on solutions.
    This document aims to discuss threats, security requirements and desired design
    properties of an enhanced OAuth security mechanism.</p>
