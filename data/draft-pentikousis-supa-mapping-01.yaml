abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale and
    complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage and configure
    the network. Deploying policy or configuration based on an abstract view of the
    underlying network is much better than manipulating each individual network element,
    however, in this case, the policy and configuration cannot be recognized by the
    network elements. This document describes guidelines for mapping configuration
    and policy into device-level configuration and the way in which such SUPA models
    will be processed by software to produce configuration details for actual devices.
    The SUPA framework overview and primary procedures of mapping are proposed. Moreover,
    an exemplary mapping scenario is provided to illustrate the mechanism involved.</p>"
