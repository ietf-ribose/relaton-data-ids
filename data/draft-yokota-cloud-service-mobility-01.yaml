abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine
    makesit possible to dynamically relocate functional entities withouttopological
    and physical constraints. By tapping into thistechnique, service mobility, which
    deals with not only functionalentities but also sessions established between those
    entities, willbecome possible and such capability is especially longed forrealizing
    more scalable and reliable telecom networks. This documentprovides the reference
    model for service mobility in a virtualenvironment and defines the control protocol
    between the virtualizedplatform and the managing controller to realize service
    mobility.</p>"
