abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A method for indirectly publishing presence information is described.\nThis
    allows a presentity user agent to publish a URI that can be used\nby the presence
    agent to retrieve presence information.  A presence\nagent is then better able
    to acquire dynamic presence information\nwithout relying on the presentity user
    agent.  This also allows a\npresentity user agent to delegate responsibility for
    managing\nchanging presence data to the source of that information.\n\t </p>\n
