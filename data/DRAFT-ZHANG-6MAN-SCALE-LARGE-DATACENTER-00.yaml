abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Server virtualization has been overwhelmingly accepted especially
    in\n   cloud-based data centers. Accompanied with expansion of services and\n
    \  technology advancements, the size of a data center has increased\n   significantly.
    There could be hundreds or thousands of physical servers\n   installed in a single
    large data center which implies that the number\n   of Virtual Machines (VMs)
    could be in the order of millions.\n   Effectively supporting millions of VMs
    with limited hardware resources,\n   becomes a real challenge to networking vendors.
    This document describes a\n   method to scale a switching system with limited
    hardware resources\n   using IPv6 in large data center environments.\n\n\t </p>\n
