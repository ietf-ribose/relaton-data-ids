abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an extension to LSP for the Rbridge
    in one\n   site to advertise Global VLAN scope and associated link attribute to\n
    \  all the Rbridges both in the site of that Border Rbridge and the\n   other
    adjacent sites in the same campus.  With this extension,\n   RBridges can prune
    the distribution tree of multi-destination frames\n   according to the scope of
    the VLAN and link attribute defined in this\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
