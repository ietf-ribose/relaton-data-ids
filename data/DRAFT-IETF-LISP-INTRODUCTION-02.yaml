abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LISP is an upgrade to the architecture of the IP internetworking\n
    \  system, one which separates location and identity (previously\n   intermingled
    in IP addresses).  This is a change which has been\n   identified by the IRTF
    as a critically necessary evolutionary\n   architectural step for the Internet.
    \ In LISP, nodes have both a\n   'locator' (a name which says _where_ in the network's
    connectivity\n   structure the node is) and an 'identifier' (a name which provides
    a\n   persistent handle for the node).  A node may have more than one\n   locator,
    or its locator may change over time (e.g. if the node is\n   mobile), but it keeps
    the same identifier.\n\n   One of the chief novelties of LISP, compared to other
    proposals for\n   the separation of location and identity, is its approach to
    deploying\n   this upgrade.  LISP aims to achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment\n
    \  necessary for maximum exploitation of an architectural upgrade by i)\n   minimizing
    the amount of change needed (existing hosts and routers\n   can operate unmodified);
    and ii) by providing significant benefits to\n   early adopters.\n\n   This document
    is an introductory overview of the entire LISP system,\n   for those who are unfamiliar
    with it.  The first half of the document\n   is a unified stand-alone brief introduction
    to LISP, for those who\n   only want a basic understanding of LISP; the document
    taken as a\n   whole provides a more detailed overview of LISP and its operation.\n\n\t
