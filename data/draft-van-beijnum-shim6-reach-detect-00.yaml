abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allowsmultihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication between theinitially chosen addresses
    for a transport session is no longerpossible, a \"shim\" layer makes it possible
    to switch to a different setof addresses without breaking current transport protocol
    assumptions.This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currentlyused
    address pair between two hosts (\"current pair reachability\") andand picking
    a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs (\"fullpath exploration\").</p>"
