abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how DSR [1] can be extended for the support
    of MANET multipath routing. In DSR, the route record informatio is available at
    the destination, so the destination can select multiple routes with good characteristics
    and notify the source of them. Therefore, in this draft, we describe how we can
    extend the Route Request option to specify the number of routes selected at the
    destination.</p>"
