abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, distributing traffic
    to acluster of multiple downstream servers, can use the DNS SRV mechanismto perform
    load balancing. However, the \"weight\" field in the DNSSRV mechanism is intended
    for static server selection. Over time,the traffic arriving at the downstream
    SIP servers may cause them toenter an overload condition, adversely impacting
    the throughput ofthe SIP cluster. This document proposes to impart the dynamic
    loadof each SIP server to the load distributing SIP proxy, therebyallowing it
    to load balance the traffic so as to reduce --- or evenprevent --- an overload
    condition.</p>"
