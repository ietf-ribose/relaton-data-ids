abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along
    the\n   standards track, specifically RFC 2679 on One-way Delay Metrics.\n   Observing
    that the metric definitions themselves should be the\n   primary focus rather
    than the implementations of metrics, this memo\n   describes the test procedures
    to evaluate specific metric requirement\n   clauses to determine if the requirement
    has been interpreted and\n   implemented as intended.  Two completely independent
    implementations\n   have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
