abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The draft makes performance analysis in two kinds of resource\nexchange
    and discovery methods, tracker based and DHT based\narchitectures in P2P streaming.
    Our analysis shows that centralized\ntracker solution for resource discovery (and
    chunk lookup) has much\nshorter response time than highly distributed DHT approach.\n\t
