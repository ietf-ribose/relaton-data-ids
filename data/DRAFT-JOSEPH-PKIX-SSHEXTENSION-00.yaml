abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key
    distribution\n   protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public keys.
    \ However,\n   that protocol is limited to provisioning an SSH server.   This
    document\n   describes extensions to this protocol to allow the provisioning of
    keys\n   and certificates to a server using the SSH transport.\n\n   The defined
    protocol extensions allow the calling client to organize\n   keys and certificates
    in different namespaces on a server.  These\n   namespaces can be used by the
    server to allow a client to configure\n   any application running on the server
    (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP).\n\n   The defined extensions provide a server-independent
    mechanism for clients\n   to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates,
    remove\n   certificates, and list the current set of keys and certificates known
    by\n   the server by namespace (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH\n   namespace).\n\n
    \  Rights to manage keys and certificates in a specific namespace are\n   specific
    and limited to the authorized user and are defined as part of\n   the server's
    implementation.   The described protocol is backward\n   compatible to version
    2 defined by RFC 4819.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
