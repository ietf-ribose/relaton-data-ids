abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by
    a DNSSEC\n   enabled Recursive Nameserver configured as a forwarder to send a\n
    \  single DNS query requesting to receive a complete validation path\n   along
    with the regular DNS answer, without the need to rapid-fire\n   many UDP requests
    in an attempt to attain a low latency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
