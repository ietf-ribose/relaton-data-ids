abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for
    the\n   description and negotiation of a CLUE telepresence session.  The\n   design
    of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and\n   the framework
    defined, respectively, in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and\n   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements].
    \ The companion document\n   [I-D.kyzivat-clue-signaling] delves into CLUE signaling
    details, as\n   well as on the SIP/SDP session establishment phase.  CLUE messages\n
    \  flow upon the CLUE data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP\n   over
    DTLS transport, as described in [I-D.ietf-clue-datachannel].\n   Message details,
    together with the behavior of CLUE Participants\n   acting as Media Providers
    and/or Media Consumers, are herein\n   discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
