abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    During the lifecycle of a constrained device, responsibility for managing authorization
    policies for the constrained device may change several times. To ensure the security
    of the constrained devices, the authorization to authorize must be transferred
    to the new principal in a secure way. The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework
    (DCAF) specifies how resource-constrained nodes can delegate defined authentication-
    and authorization-related tasks to less-constrained devices called Authorization
    Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements of the security solution for
    the constrained devices. This document defines how DCAF can be used to manage
    the Authorization Manager of a constrained device and introduces a flexible authorization
    solution for the whole lifecycle of a constrained device.</p>"
