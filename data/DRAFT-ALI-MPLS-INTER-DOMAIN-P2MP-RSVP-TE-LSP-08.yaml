abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>         Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \     (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label\n      Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling\n      techniques described
    in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not\n      address many issues that comes
    when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in\n      an inter-domain networks. Specifically,
    one of the issues in\n      inter-domain networks is how to allow computation
    of a loosely\n      routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free. Another
    issue\n      is reoptimization of a P2MP-TE tree vs. reoptimization of\n      an
    individual destination, as loosely routing domain border node\n      is not aware
    of the reoptimization scope. This document\n      provides a framework and required
    protocol extensions needed for\n      establishing, controlling and reoptimizing
    P2MP MPLS and GMPLS\n      TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.\n\n         This
    document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from [RFC\n      4726], e.g., for
    the purposes of this document, a domain is\n      considered to be any collection
    of network elements within a\n      common sphere of address management or path
    computational\n      responsibility. Examples of such domains include Interior
    Gateway\n      Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).\n\n\n   \n\t
