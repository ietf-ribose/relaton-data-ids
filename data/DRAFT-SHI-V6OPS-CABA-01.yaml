abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Addressing is the foundation of routing and it impacts the
    routing\n   scalability.  The IPv6 routing system will face severe scalability\n
    \  issue if the IPv6 addresses are recklessly used without careful\n   aggregation
    strategy.  This draft describes an addressing scheme and\n   the corresponding
    allocation scheme which can facilitate the\n   aggregation of IPv6 addresses and
    keep the IPv6 inter-domain routing\n   system from being overloaded.\n\n\t </p>\n
