abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism to adjust IS-IS flooding speed between
    two adjacent routers by adjusting the sender flooding speed to the capability
    of the receiver. This helps improving the flooding throughput, reducing LSPs losses
    and retransmissions due to receiver overload, and avoiding manual tuning of flooding
    parameters by the network operator. This document defines a new TLV for Hello
    messages. This TLV may carry a set of parameters indicating the performance capacity
    to receive LSPs.</p>"
