abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 8007 to include generic extensions
    and more\n   granular content matching options, required by the Open Caching\n
    \  architecture.  The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video\n   Alliance
    is focused on the delegation of video delivery request from\n   commercial CDNs
    to a caching layer at the ISP.  In that aspect, Open\n   Caching is a specific
    use case of CDNI, where the commercial CDN is\n   the upstream CDN (uCDN) and
    the ISP caching layer is the downstream\n   CDN (dCDN).  The extensions specified
    in this document to the CDNI\n   Control Interface / Triggers are derived from
    requirements of Open\n   Caching but are applicable to CDNI use cases in general.\n\n\n\t
