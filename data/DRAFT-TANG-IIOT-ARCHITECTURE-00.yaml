abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the foundation of the current new round of industrial revolution,\n
    \  the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on Cyber-Physical\n   Systems
    (CPS) [smart-factory] has become the focus of research in\n   various countries.
    \ In the entire development stage of IIoT, one of\n   the key issues is the standardization
    of the IIoT architecture.  With\n   the development of intelligent manufacturing
    technology, the number\n   of the IIoT devices will increase sharply, and a large
    amount of data\n   will be generated in the industrial manufacturing process.
    \ However,\n   traditional industrial networks cannot meet the IIoT requirements
    for\n   high data rates, low latency, massive connections, interconnection\n   and
    interoperability.  The current IIoT architectures also have\n   various limitations:
    mobility, security, scalability, and\n   communication reliability.  These limitations
    hinder the development\n   and implementation of IIoT.  As a network layer protocol,
    IPv6 can\n   solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.  As a high-speed, low-\n
    \  latency wireless communication technology, 5G has great potential in\n   promoting
    IIoT.  In order to solve the above problems, this draft\n   proposes an IIoT architecture
    based on IPv6 and 5G.  It can provide\n   high-speed, low-latency communication
    services, provide massive\n   connectivity, mobility, scalability, security and
    other features for\n   industrial device.  And the architecture can provide generalized,\n
    \  refined, and flexible network services for devices outside the\n   factory.
    \ And an information model is defined to standardize the\n   representation of
    information in IIoT.  Finally, the draft discusses\n   security challenges and
    recommendations in IIoT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
