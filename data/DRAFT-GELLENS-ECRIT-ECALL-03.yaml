abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan European in-\n   vehicle
    emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative\n   of the European
    Commission (generally referred to as \"eCall\"). eCall\n   is a standardized and
    mandated system for a special form of emergency\n   calls placed by vehicles.
    \ eCall deployment is required by 2015 in\n   European Union member states, and
    eCall is also being deployed in\n   other regions.  eCall provides an integrated
    voice path and a\n   standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related),
    and\n   location data.  An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized\n
    \  form of emergency call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable\n   Public
    Safety Answering Point (PSAP) capable of processing the\n   vehicle data and trained
    in handling emergency calls from vehicles.\n   Currently, eCall functions over
    circuit-switched cellular telephony;\n   work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall,
    sometimes called packet-\n   switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and
    this document\n   assists in that work by describing how to support eCall within
    the\n   IP-based emergency services infrastructure.\n\n   This document also registers
    a MIME Content Type and an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block for the eCall
    vehicle data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
