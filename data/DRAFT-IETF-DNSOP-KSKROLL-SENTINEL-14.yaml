abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
    origin\n   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n
    \  signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain
    of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular
    node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that\n   will allow an end
    user and third parties to determine the trusted key\n   state for the root key
    of the resolvers that handle that user's DNS\n   queries.  Note that this method
    is only applicable for determining\n   which keys are in the trust store for the
    root key.\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/APNIC-Labs/draft-kskroll-sentinel.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  RFC\n   Editor,
    please remove text in square brackets before publication. ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
