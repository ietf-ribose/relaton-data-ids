abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document, we propose another solution to support Internet
    \n   connectivity for AODV. In the design of our solution, several \n   important
    limits of existing solutions are considered. Especially, \n   new route determination
    and forwarding algorithms are proposed. \n   Proposed route determination algorithm
    supports dynamic switching \n   between default route and host route in a sender
    node through which \n   enhanced performance can be achieved under frequent topological
    \n   changes. And proposed forwarding algorithm supports next hop \n   forwarding
    for default routes towards multiple gateways.\n\t </p>\n      "
