abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reviews the architectural design of the transport\n
    \  layer.  In particular, this document proposes to separate the\n   transport
    layer into two sublayers; the data path and the data flow\n   layers.  The data
    path layer provides functionality on the data path,\n   such as connection handling,
    path quality and trajectory monitoring,\n   waypoint management, and congestion
    control for the data path\n   resource management.  The data flow layer provides
    additional\n   functionality upon the data path layer, such as flow control for
    the\n   receive buffer management, retransmission for reliable data delivery,\n
    \  and transport layer security.  The data path layer multiplexes\n   multiple
    data flow layer protocols and provides data path information\n   to the data flow
    layer to control data transmissions, such as\n   prioritization and inverse multiplexing
    for multipath protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
