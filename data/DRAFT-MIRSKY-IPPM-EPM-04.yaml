abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the error performance metric
    to\n   characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre-\n   defined
    set of performance objectives.  In this document, metrics\n   that characterize
    error performance in a packet-switched network\n   (PSN) are defined, as well
    as methods to measure and calculate them.\n   Also, the requirements for an active
    Operation, Administration, and\n   Maintenance protocol to support the error performance
    measurement in\n   PSN are discussed, and potential candidate protocols are analyzed.\n
    \  All metrics and measurement methods are equally applicable to\n   underlay
    and overlay networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
