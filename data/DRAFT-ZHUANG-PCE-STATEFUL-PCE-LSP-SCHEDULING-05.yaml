abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a set of extensions needed to the stateful\n
    \  Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as\n   to
    enable Labeled Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation\n   and LSP
    setup/deletion based on the actual network resource usage\n   duration of a traffic
    service in a centralized network environment as\n   stated in [I.D.ietf-teas-scheduled-resources].\n\n\t
