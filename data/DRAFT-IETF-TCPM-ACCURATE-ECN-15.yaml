abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where
    network\n   nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   incipient
    congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-\n   capable transport protocol
    feed back this information to the sender.\n   ECN was originally specified for
    TCP in such a way that only one\n   feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip
    Time (RTT).  Recent\n   new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data
    Center TCP\n   (DCTCP) or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need
    more\n   accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is\n
    \  received in one RTT.  This document specifies a scheme to provide\n   more
    than one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header.  Given TCP\n   header space
    is scarce, it allocates a reserved header bit previously\n   assigned to the ECN-Nonce.
    \ It also overloads the two existing ECN\n   flags in the TCP header.  The resulting
    extra space is exploited to\n   feed back the IP-ECN field received during the
    3-way handshake as\n   well.  Supplementary feedback information can optionally
    be provided\n   in a new TCP option, which is never used on the TCP SYN.  The\n
    \  document also specifies the treatment of this updated TCP wire\n   protocol
    by middleboxes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
