abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document shows that short TCP sessions are prone to timeout.
    Inparticular, one single segment loss will provoke TCP to timeout if thedocument
    size is below certain threshold. This document analyzes thebenefit of TCP modifications
    such as Limited Transmit Algorithm[RFC3042] and Increasing Initial Window [RFC2414]
    in the context ofshort-lived TCP transfers. However TCP remains vulnerable to
    the lossesat the very end of the transmission. Therefore we suggest complementarymodifications
    to Limited Transmit Algorithm to recover effectively fromlosses at the end of
    the TCP transfer.</p>"
