abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) keying framework
    [1]\n   leaves out guidelines for using the extended master session key\n   (EMSK)
    for future discussion and specification.  While the keying\n   framework does
    provide guidance for EAP master session key (MSK)\n   usage, some SDOs use that
    key in a non-compliant manner.  This\n   document provides a description and analysis
    of MSK and EMSK usage\n   and provides an outline for a discussion on these topics.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
