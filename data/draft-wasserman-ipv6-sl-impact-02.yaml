abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) introduces a scoped unicastaddressing
    architecture, including the concept of site-localaddressing. Although site-local
    addresses were originally definedfor use in networks that were not yet connected
    to the Internet,there has been work underway for several years to expand the use
    ofsite-local addresses to globally connected IPv6 networks and nodes.The use of
    site-local addresses on globally connected networks andnodes raises complex technical
    issues for many parts of the TCP/IPprotocol suite. Many of these issues are caused
    by the fact thatIPv6 sites are private address spaces, and site-local addresses
    areunreachable or ambiguous outside the borders of their originatingsite. Site-local
    addresses also add significant complexity at theIP layer and at other layers of
    the protocol stack. In addition,many of the benefits of site-local addressing
    can be achieved usingmechanisms that are significantly less complex and that cause
    fewerproblems than IPv6 site-local addressing.This document makes a recommendation
    to limit the use of site-localaddresses to isolated, single-site networks, and
    offers suggestionsfor less complicated mechanisms to achieve many of the benefitscurrently
    attributed to IPv6 site-local addressing.</p>"
