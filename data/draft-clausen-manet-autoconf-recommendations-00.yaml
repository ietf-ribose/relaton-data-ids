abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a pragmatic set of configurationrecommendations
    for MANETs, as well as provides a rationale for whythese recommendations are sound.
    While there may be other equallyvalid ways of configuring a MANET, the recommendations
    in thisdocument have the merit of being supported by an existence proof(there're
    running networks in existence, configured according tothese recommendations),
    and they require neither modifications to theIP stack nor to upper-layer protocols
    or applications.</p>"
