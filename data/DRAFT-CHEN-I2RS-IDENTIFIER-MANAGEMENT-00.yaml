abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An I2RS Agent may communicate with multiple clients.  Two (or
    more)\n   client may attempt to manipulate the same piece of data on the I2RS\n
    \  Agent.  In order to solve this collision, the proposal is to have a\n   simple
    priority associated with each I2RS Client.\n\n   In addition, if the hold timer
    for an I2RS session expires, the I2RS\n   Agent should delete the I2RS data associated
    with the I2RS Client.\n   In order to delete the related I2RS data correctly,
    it is important\n   to identify the client on the I2RS Agent.\n\n   This document
    describes how to deploy identifier and priority\n   associated with each I2RS
    Client based on\n   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
