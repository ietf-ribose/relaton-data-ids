abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo defines Name-based sockets. name-based sockets allowapplication
    developers to refer to remote hosts (and it self) by nameonly, passing on all
    IP (locator) management to the operating system.Applications are thus relieved
    of re-implementing features such asmulti-homing, mobility, NAT traversal, IPv6/IPv4
    interoperability andaddress management in general. The operating system can in
    turn re-use the same solutions for a whole set of guest applications. name-based
    sockets aims to provide a whole set of features without addingnew indirection
    layers, new delays or other dependences whilemaintaining transparent backwards
    compatibility.</p>"
