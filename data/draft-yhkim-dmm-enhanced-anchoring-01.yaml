abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new perspective for the solution design of
    enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management deployment. Based
    on the definition of anchor function, location management function, and forwarding
    management function in RFC7429, we propose four cases of distributed deployment
    models and enhanced anchoring models over them.</p>"
