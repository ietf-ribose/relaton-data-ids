  content: "\n\t <p>   SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter
    that \n   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other
    \n   important state that can describe the originating party. Based on the \n
    \  CPC parameter from the calling network, the called network can do \n   some
    special processes related to the calling party category, just \n   like override
    the calee's DND and some other barring services. \n\n   This document specifies
    a way to deliver the calling party category \n   to implement some supplementary
    services derived from the PSTN \n   network. \n\t </p>\n      "
