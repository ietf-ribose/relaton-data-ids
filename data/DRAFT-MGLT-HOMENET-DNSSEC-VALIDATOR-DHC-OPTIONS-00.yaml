abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC\n
    \  validators.  However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable\n   value
    for the current time.  DNSSEC validation cannot be performed.\n   This leads to
    multiple exceptions where DNSSEC validation MUST NOT be\n   performed.  This list
    of exception is expected to become larger if\n   DNSSEC is deployed this way.
    \ All conditions where DNSSEC is disable\n   adds complexity to the implementation
    and increases the vectors that\n   disables security.\n\n   This document assumes
    that DNSSEC adoption by end devices requires\n   that end devices can have DNSSEC
    always set today and in the future.\n\n   This document describes DHCP Options
    to provision the DHCP Client\n   with valid trust anchors and time so DNSSEC validation
    can be\n   performed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
