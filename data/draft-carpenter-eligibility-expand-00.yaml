abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to participate
    in the IETF Nominating Committee. It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying
    signatories to a community recall petition. The purpose is to make the criteria
    more flexible in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a probable
    decline in face-to-face meetings. This document updates RFC8713.</p>"
