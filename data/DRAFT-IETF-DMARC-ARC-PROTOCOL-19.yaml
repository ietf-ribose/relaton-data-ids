abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an\n
    \  authenticated \"chain of custody\" for a message, allowing each entity\n   that
    handles the message to see what entities handled it before, and\n   to see what
    the message's authentication assessment was at each step\n   in the handling.\n\n
    \  ARC allows Internet Mail Handlers to attach assertions of message\n   authentication
    assessment to individual messages.  As messages\n   traverse ARC-enabled Internet
    Mail Handlers, additional ARC\n   assertions can be attached to messages to form
    ordered sets of ARC\n   assertions that represent the authentication assessment
    at each step\n   of message handling paths.\n\n   ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers
    can process sets of ARC assertions\n   to inform message disposition decisions,
    to identify Internet Mail\n   Handlers that might break existing authentication
    mechanisms, and to\n   convey original authentication assessments across trust
    boundaries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
