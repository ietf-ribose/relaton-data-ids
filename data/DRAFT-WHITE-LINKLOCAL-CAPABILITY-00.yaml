abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP, described in [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide\n
    \  reachability between domains and between the edges of a domain.  As\n   such,
    BGP assumes the next hop towards any reachable destination may\n   not reside
    on the advertising speaker, but rather may either be\n   through a router connected
    to the same subnet as the speaker, or\n   through a router only reachable by traversing
    multiple hops through\n   the network.  Because of this, BGP does not recognize
    the use of IPv6\n   link-local addresses, as described in [RFC4291], as a valid
    next hop\n   for forwarding purposes.\n\n   However, BGP speakers are now often
    deployed on point-to-point links\n   in networks where multihop reachability of
    any kind is not assumed or\n   desired (all next hops are assumed to be the speaker
    reachable\n   through a directly connected point-to-point link).  This is common,\n
    \  for instance, in data center fabrics.  In these situations, a global\n   IPv6
    address is not required for the advertisement of reachability\n   information;
    in fact, providing global IPv6 addresses in these kinds\n   of networks can be
    detrimental to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).\n\n   This draft standardizes the
    operation of BGP over a point-to-point\n   link using link-local IPv6 addressing
    only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
