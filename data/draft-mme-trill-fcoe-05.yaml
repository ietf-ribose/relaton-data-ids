abstract:
- content: "<p>Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links (TRILL) are two emerging standards in the data center environment.
    While these two protocols are seemingly unrelated, they have a very similar behavior
    in the forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over Ethernet,
    modifying the packet's Media Access Control (MAC) addresses at each hop. This
    document describes an architecture for the integrated deployment of these two
    protocols. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>"
