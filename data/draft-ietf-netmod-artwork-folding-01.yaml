abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for
    handling long lines in inclusions in drafts using a backslash ('\\') character
    where line-folding has occurred. The strategy works on any text-based content,
    but is primarily intended for a structured sequence of lines, such as would be
    referenced by the &lt;sourcecode&gt; element defined in Section 2.48 of RFC 7991,
    rather than for two- dimensional imagery, such as would be referenced by the &lt;artwork&gt;
    element defined in Section 2.5 of RFC 7991. The approach produces consistent results,
    regardless of the content, that is both self- documenting and enables automated
    reconstitution of the original content.</p>"
