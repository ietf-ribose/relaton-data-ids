abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines two media types and a link relation
    type\n   for sets of links.  The media types can be used to represents links\n
    \  in a standalone fashion, in one case in the native format as used in\n   the
    HTTP Link header, and in the other case in a JSON-based format.\n   The link relation
    type can be used by a resource to point at another\n   resource that provides
    a set of links, including links in which the\n   former resource participates.
    \ One typical scenario is when the\n   number of links to put in an HTTP Link
    header becomes too big, and\n   thus these links should be provided in another
    way.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
