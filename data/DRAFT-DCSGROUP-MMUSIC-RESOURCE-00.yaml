abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a two-stage call-setup mechanism, with
    the\nresource management protocol interleaved between the two stages. The\nobjective
    of such a mechanism is to enable deployment of robust IP\nTelephony services.
    The first phase ensures that resources are made\navailable before the phone rings
    and the participants of the call\nare 'invited' to participate. The second phase
    involves the alerting\nof the user after the network resources are reserved. This
    draft\npresents the call signaling requirements that lead to this design,\nand
    the specific SIP extension of an INVITE that does not ring the\nfar-end phone.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
