abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange\n
    \  version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management.\n   The
    protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key\n   management
    architecture, which contains two components: member\n   registration and group
    rekeying.  Both components require a Group\n   Controller/Key Server to download
    IPsec group security associations\n   to authorized members of a group.  The group
    members then exchange IP\n   multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets.
    \ This document\n   obsoletes RFC 6407.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
