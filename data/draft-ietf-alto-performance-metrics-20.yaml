abstract:
- content: <p>The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO), and different applications may use different types of cost metrics. Since
    the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a single cost metric (namely, the
    generic "routingcost" metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or
    an endpoint cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
    a better delay performance, the base protocol does not define the cost metric
    to be used. This document addresses this issue by extending the specification
    to provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network delay,
    delay variation (jitter), packet loss rate, hop count, and bandwidth. There are
    multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements or service-level agreement)
    to derive a performance metric. This document introduces an additional "cost-context"
    field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey the source of a performance metric.</p>
