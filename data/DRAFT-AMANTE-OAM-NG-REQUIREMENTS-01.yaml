  content: "\n\t <p>Current IP and MPLS OAM techniques need to be extended to permit\noperators
    to effectively diagnose load-balancing issues.\nSpecifically, new ad-hoc OAM techniques
    are needed to diganose\nvarious link-bundling techniques, such as IP/MPLS Equal
    Cost Multi-\nPath (ECMP) and Link Aggregation Groups (LAG).  In addition, these\nOAM
    tools should also be extended to permit performance monitoring\nover longer time
    durations.  This document defines requirements for\nthe next generation of OAM
    solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
