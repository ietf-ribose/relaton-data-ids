abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the addition of a latency spin bit
    to the\n   QUIC transport protocol and describes how to use it to measure end-\n
    \  to-end latency.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   This document specifies an experimental
    delta to the QUIC transport\n   protocol.  Specifically, this experimentation
    is intended to\n   determine:\n\n   o  the impact of the addition of the latency
    spin bit on\n      implementation and specification complexity; and\n\n   o  the
    accuracy and value of the information derived from spin bit\n      measurement
    on live network traffic.\n\n   The information generated by this experiment will
    be used by the QUIC\n   working group as input to a decision about the standardization
    of the\n   latency spin bit.  Although this is a Working Group document, it is\n
    \  currently NOT a Working Group deliverable.\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes
    place on the QUIC working group\n   mailing list (quic@ietf.org), which is archived
    at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic [1].\n\n   Working
    Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg\n   [2]; source code
    and issues list for this draft can be found at\n   https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-spin
    [3].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
