abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) makes expression of domain
    name\nrich.  The demand for such enrichment is to use native language\ncharacters
    in a domain name.  IDN itself has no locale dependency as a\nprotocol, but to
    utilize IDN in the real world, language and/or\nregional aspects should be taken
    into account.\nThis document explains a guideline to any IDN zone administrator
    who\naccepts Japanese as an IDN label.\n\t </p>\n      "
