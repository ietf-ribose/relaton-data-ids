abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] specifies that the set
    of\n   network-layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop\n
    \  field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n   and
    the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The current\n   AFI/SAFI definitions
    for the IPv4 address family only have provisions\n   for advertising a Next Hop
    address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol\n   when advertising IPv4 Network Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI)\n   or VPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies
    the extensions necessary\n   to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
    a Next Hop\n   address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n
    \  extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the\n   Next
    Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6\n   protocol, the
    encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of\n   the protocols the
    address actually belongs to, and a new BGP\n   Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers
    to dynamically discover whether they\n   can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI
    with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
