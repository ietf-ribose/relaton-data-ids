abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a functional model for forwarding elements
    \n(FEs) used in the Forwarding and Control Plane Separation (ForCES) \nprotocol.
    \ This model is used to describe the capabilities, \ncapacities, state and configuration
    of ForCES forwarding elements \nwithin the context of the ForCES protocol, so
    that ForCES control \nelements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly. The model
    is to \nspecify what logical functions are present in the FEs, what \ncapabilities
    these functions support, and how these functions are \nor can be interconnected.
    The forwarding element model defined \nherein is intended to satisfy the requirements
    specified in the \nForCES requirements draft [FORCES-REQ].  Using this model,
    \npredefined or vendor specific logical functions can be expressed \nand configured.
    However, the definition of these individual \nfunctions are not described and
    defined in this document.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
