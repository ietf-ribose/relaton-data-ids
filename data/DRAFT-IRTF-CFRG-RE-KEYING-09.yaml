abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when\n
    \  encryption is performed under a single key.  This amount is called\n   \"key
    lifetime\".  This specification describes a variety of methods to\n   increase
    the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides external and\n   internal re-keying
    mechanisms based on hash functions and on block\n   ciphers, that can be used
    with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM,\n   CBC, CFB and OMAC.\n\n\t </p>\n
