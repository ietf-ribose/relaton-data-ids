abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification
    for\n   CCN.  Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or\n   multicast
    to multiple listening points.  Notifications do not expect\n   a Content Object
    response hence only requires the use of FIB state in\n   the CCN forwarder.  Emulating
    Notification as a PULL has performance\n   and routing implications.  The draft
    first discusses the design\n   choices associated with using current Interest/Data
    abstraction for\n   achieving push and challenges associated with them.  We follow
    this\n   by proposing a new fixed header primitive called Notification and a\n
    \  CCN message encoding using Content Object primitive to transport\n   Notifications.
    \ This discussion are presented in the context of\n   CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.  The
    draft also provides discussions on various\n   aspects related to notification
    such as flow and congestion control,\n   routing and reliability considerations,
    and use case scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
