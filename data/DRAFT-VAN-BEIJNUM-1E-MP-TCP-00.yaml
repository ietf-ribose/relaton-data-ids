abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Normal TCP/IP operation is for the routing system to select a
    best\npath that remains stable for some time, and for TCP to adjust to the\nproperties
    of this path to optimize throughput.  A multipath TCP\nwould be able to either
    use capacity on multiple paths, or\ndynamically find the best performing path,
    and therefore reach higher\nthroughput.  By adapting to the properties of several
    paths through\nthe usual congestion control algorithms, a multipath TCP shifts
    its\ntraffic to less congested paths, leaving more capacity available for\ntraffic
    that can't move to another path on more congested paths.  And\nwhen a path fails,
    this can be detected and worked around by TCP much\nmore quickly than by waiting
    for the routing system to repair the\nfailure.\n\nThis memo specifies a multipath
    TCP that is implemented on the\nsending host only, without requiring modifications
    on the receiving\nhost.\n\t </p>\n      "
