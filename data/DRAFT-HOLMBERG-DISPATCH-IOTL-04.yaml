abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks, the
    signalling\n   path between a calling user and a called user can be partioned
    into\n   segments, referred to as traffic legs.  Each traffic leg may span\n   networks
    belonging to different operators, and will have its own\n   characteristics that
    can be different from other traffic legs in the\n   same call.  A traffic leg
    might be associated with multiple SIP\n   dialogs, e.g. in case a B2BUA which
    modifies the SIP dialog\n   identifier is located within the traffic leg.\n\n
    \  This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl'.  The parameter\n   can
    be used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with\n   the address,
    or an entity responsible for the host part of the\n   address, represents the
    end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple\n   traffic legs).\n\n   The SIP URI
    'iotl' parameter defined in this document has known uses\n   in 3GPP networks.
    \ Usage in other networks is also possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
