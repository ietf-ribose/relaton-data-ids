abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the framework to support a new protocol
    forexplicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can bedeployed
    incrementally around unmodified routers. Re-ECN allowsaccurate congestion monitoring
    throughout the network thus enablingthe upstream party at any trust boundary in
    the internetwork to beheld responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow
    to becaused. So, networks can introduce straightforward accountabilityfor congestion
    and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end-customers or from neighbouring
    network domains. As well as givingthe motivation for re-ECN this document also
    gives examples ofmechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respondcorrectly
    to congestion. And it describes example mechanisms thatensure the dominant selfish
    strategy of both network domains and end-points will be to use the protocol honestly.</p>"
