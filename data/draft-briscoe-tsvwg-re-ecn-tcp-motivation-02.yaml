abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework to support a new protocol for
    explicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployed incrementally
    around unmodified routers. Re-ECN allows accurate congestion monitoring throughout
    the network thus enabling the upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork
    to be held responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to be caused. So,
    networks can introduce straightforward accountability for congestion and policing
    mechanisms for incoming traffic from end- customers or from neighbouring network
    domains. As well as giving the motivation for re-ECN this document also gives
    examples of mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond
    correctly to congestion. And it describes example mechanisms that ensure the dominant
    selfish strategy of both network domains and end- points will be to use the protocol
    honestly.</p>"
