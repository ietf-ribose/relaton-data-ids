abstract:
  content: "<p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technique whereby a device,known
    as an RFID 'reader', can remotely sense the presence of, andaccess embedded memory
    on, a transponder known as a 'tag'. Tags may beaffixed to objects as a means of
    tracking the location and movement ofsaid objects within facilities equipped with
    RFID readers. Typically,readers communicate with upstream devices, in this document
    referred toas 'controllers', to receive control commands and upload read taginformation.This
    draft specifies the Simple Lightweight RFID Reader Protocol, orSLRRP (pronounced
    'slurp'), to be used to convey configuration, control,status, and tag information
    between controllers and readers in an IP-based network.</p>"
