abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Service Connect (JCX) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may be used
    to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device to an account held
    with a Web Service Provider. Multiple connection bindings may be established under
    the same account to support multiple devices and/or multiple users of a single
    device. A connection binding permits a device to securely connect to one or more
    services offered by the Web Service Provider with support for protocol and protocol
    version agilty and fault tollerance. The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON
    Web Service and uses the HTTP session continuation mechanism for authentication
    of transaction messages and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation
    mechanism context for the established endpoint connections.</p>"
