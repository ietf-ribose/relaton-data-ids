abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC 0-RTT relies on the sharing of the \"initial_max_data\"
    transport\n   parameter between peers.  It indicates to the client the number
    of\n   bytes it is allowed to send in the first packet of the 0-RTT\n   connection.
    \ This allows a faster startup of flows and enables\n   adaptated buffer sizes
    at the server.  The traffic that the client\n   sends, i.e. the egress trafic,
    is improved.  This memo proposes the\n   sharing of additional transport parameters
    to provide a faster\n   startup of flows and a better buffer management for the
    data that the\n   client receives, i.e. the ingress traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
