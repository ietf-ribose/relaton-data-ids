abstract:
- content: "<p>Many emerging Internet applications use URIs to identify various protocol
    components. In many of these cases it is possible for a URI to be used as a value
    that was created outside the context of that application. This document describes
    an architecture using RESCAP and RDF to allow an application to discover basic
    relationships between the URI in question and its Resource.</p>"
