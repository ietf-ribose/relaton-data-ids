abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached\n
    \  to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers\n   that
    provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and\n   redirection
    services for route optimization.  AERO provides an IPv6\n   link-local address
    format that supports operation of the IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol
    and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding.\n   Admission control and address/prefix provisioning
    are supported by\n   the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),
    while\n   mobility management and route optimization are naturally supported\n
    \  through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  Although DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND\n   messaging
    are used in the control plane, both IPv4 and IPv6 are\n   supported in the data
    plane.  AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling\n   solution especially well suited
    to mobile Virtual Private Networks\n   (VPNs) and other applications as described
    in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
