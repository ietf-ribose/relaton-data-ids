abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedures and recommendations for Virtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) Provider Edges (PEs) to facilitate replication of multicast
    traffic to only certain ports (behind which there are interested Protocol Independent
    Multicast (PIM) routers and/or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) hosts)
    via Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) snooping and proxying. With PIM snooping,
    PEs passively listen to certain PIM control messages to build control and forwarding
    states while transparently flooding those messages. With PIM proxying, Provider
    Edges (PEs) do not flood PIM Join/Prune messages but only generate their own and
    send out of certain ports, based on the control states built from downstream Join/Prune
    messages. PIM proxying is required when PIM Join suppression is enabled on the
    Customer Equipment (CE) devices and useful to reduce PIM control traffic in a
    VPLS domain. The document also describes PIM relay, which can be viewed as light-
    weight proxying, where all downstream Join/Prune messages are simply forwarded
    out of certain ports but not flooded to avoid triggering PIM Join suppression
    on CE devices.</p>"
