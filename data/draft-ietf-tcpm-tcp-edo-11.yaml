abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP segments include a Data Offset field to indicate space for TCP
    options but the size of the field can limit the space available for complex options
    such as SACK and Multipath TCP and can limit the combination of such options supported
    in a single connection. This document updates RFC 793 with an optional TCP extension
    to that space to support the use of multiple large options. It also explains why
    the initial SYN of a connection cannot be extending a single segment.</p>"
