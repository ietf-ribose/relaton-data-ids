abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite\n
    \  intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in\n   browsers
    - \"real time communication on the Web\".\n\n   It intends to serve as a starting
    and coordination point to make sure\n   all the parts that are needed to achieve
    this goal are findable, and\n   that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol
    suite are fully\n   specified and on the right publication track.\n\n   This work
    is an attempt to synthesize the input of many people, but\n   makes no claims
    to fully represent the views of any of them.  All\n   parts of the document should
    be regarded as open for discussion,\n   unless the RTCWEB chairs have declared
    consensus on an item.\n\n   This document is a candidate to become a work item
    of the RTCWEB\n   working group.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
