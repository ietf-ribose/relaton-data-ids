abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There exists a class of devices where DLEP functionality is
    desired\n   but as the devices operate at layer-3, supporting the core DLEP\n
    \  specification with its requirement that modems operate as transparent\n   layer-2
    bridges is inappropriate.\n\n   This document introduces two optional extensions
    to the core DLEP\n   specification.  Each extension may be used in isolation without\n
    \  breaking backwards compatibility.\n\n   By relaxing the requirement that all
    DLEP destinations be identified\n   by MAC address, and the addition of a new
    extension TLV describing\n   available destination routes, the functionality of
    DLEP can be\n   implemented by layer-3 forwarding devices.\n\n   Note:\n\n   o
    \ This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP\n      specification,
    and readers are expected to be fully conversant\n      with the operation of core
    DLEP.\n\n   o  The DLEP specification is still in draft, and this document serves\n
    \     a secondary purpose to explore and validate the extension\n      mechanisms
    detailed in DLEP.  This document will therefore require\n      further update
    as the core DLEP draft progresses towards standards\n      track.\n\n\t </p>\n
