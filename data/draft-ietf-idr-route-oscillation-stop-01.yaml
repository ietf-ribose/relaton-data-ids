abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we present two sets of paths for an address prefix
    that can be advertised by a BGP route reflector or confederation ASBR to eliminate
    the MED-induced route oscillations in a network. The first set involves all the
    available paths, and would achieve the same routing consistency as the full IBGP
    mesh. The second set, which is a subset of the first one, involves the neighbor-AS
    based Group Best Paths, and would be sufficient to eliminate the MED- induced
    route oscillations (subject to certain commonly adopted topological constrains).</p>"
