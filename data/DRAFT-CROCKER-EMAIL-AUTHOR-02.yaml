abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author
    of the\n   message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially\n
    \  handled the message, on the author's behalf.  The Sender: field is\n   optional,
    if it has the same information as the From: field.  This\n   was not a problem,
    until development of stringent protections on use\n   of the From: field.  It
    has prompted Mediators, such as mailing\n   lists, to modify the From: field,
    to circumvent mail rejection caused\n   by those protections.  In effect, the
    From: field has become\n   dominated by its role as a handling identifier.  The
    current\n   specification augments the altered use of the From: field, by\n   specifying
    the Author: field, which ensures identification of the\n   original author of
    the message and is not subject to modification by\n   Mediators.\n\n\t </p>\n
