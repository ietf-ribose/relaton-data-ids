abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes
    for\nReed-Solomon codes that can be used to protect media streams along\nthe lines
    defined by the FECFRAME framework.  Reed-Solomon codes\nbelong to the class of
    Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which\nmeans they offer optimal protection
    against packet erasures.  They\nare also systematic codes, which means that the
    source symbols are\npart of the encoding symbols.  The price to pay is a limit
    on the\nmaximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols,\nand
    a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for\ninstance.\n\nThe
    first scheme is for Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m\n&lt;= 16
    and arbitrary packet flows.  The second scheme is similar to\nthe first scheme,
    with the exception that it is restricted to a\nsingle sequenced flow.\n\t </p>\n
