abstract:
- content: '<p>In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking
    architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints, and provides for endpoints and applications to use
    these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. While
    this property of "path awareness" already exists in many Internet-connected networks
    within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the network layer,
    a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts across layers and across
    the Internet. This document poses questions in path-aware networking open as of
    2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware
    internetworks. It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware
    Networking proposed Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot
    current thinking in this space.</p>'
