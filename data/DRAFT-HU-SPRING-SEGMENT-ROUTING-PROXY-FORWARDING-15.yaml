abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) supports explicit
    paths\n   using segment lists containing adjacency-SIDs, node-SIDs and binding-\n
    \  SIDs.  The current SR FRR such as TI-LFA provides fast re-route\n   protection
    for the failure of a node along a SR-TE path by the direct\n   neighbor or say
    point of local repair (PLR) to the failure.  However,\n   once the IGP converges,
    the SR FRR is no longer sufficient to forward\n   traffic of the path around the
    failure, since the non-neighbors of\n   the failure will no longer have a route
    to the failed node.  This\n   document describes a mechanism for the restoration
    of the routes to\n   the failure of a SR-TE path after the IGP converges.  It
    provides the\n   restoration of the routes to an adjacency segment, a node segment
    and\n   a binding segment of the path.  With the restoration of the routes to\n
    \  the failure, the traffic is continuously sent to the neighbor of the\n   failure
    after the IGP converges.  The neighbor as a PLR fast re-\n   routes the traffic
    around the failure.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
