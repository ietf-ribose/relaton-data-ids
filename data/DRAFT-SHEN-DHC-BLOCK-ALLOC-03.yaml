abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A new DHCP address allocation mechanism called Micro-blocking\n
    \  is proposed in this document. It is used for DHCP proxy servers or\n   routers
    working with DHCP servers to maximize the IP address\n   allocation efficiency
    while improve dynamic routing scalability\n   in provider's networks. A DHCP sub-option
    within the relay agent\n   information option 82 is defined in this document.
    This simple\n   DHCP extension can be applied as a simple IP address-pool management\n
    \  among multiple IP devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
