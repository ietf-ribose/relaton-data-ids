abstract:
  content: "<p>This document makes recommendations for the use of ECN withretransmitted
    data packets, for an ECN-capable TCP connection. Thisdocument supplements RFC
    2481 [RFC2481], which did not address theissue of retransmitted data packets.
    This document recommends thatfor ECN-capable TCP implementations, the ECT bit
    (ECN-CapableTransport) in the IP header SHOULD NOT be set on retransmitted datapackets,
    and that the TCP data receiver SHOULD ignore the ECN fieldon arriving data packets
    that are outside of the receiver's currentwindow. This is for greater security
    against denial-of-serviceattacks.</p>"
