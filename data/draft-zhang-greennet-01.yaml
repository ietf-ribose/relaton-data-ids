abstract:
  content: "<p>Energy consumption of network infrastructures is rising fast. There
    are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering, which adjust
    routing paths to help reduce power consumption network- wide. This document gives
    a high-level analysis on the basic requirements, approaches, and potential issues
    in power-aware routing and traffic engineering.</p>"
