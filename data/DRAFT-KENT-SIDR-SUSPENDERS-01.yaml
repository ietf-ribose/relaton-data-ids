abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is an authorization\n
    \  infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources\n   (INRs)
    to make verifiable statements about those resources.  The\n   certification authorities
    (CAs) in the RPKI issue certificates to\n   match their allocation of INRs.  These
    entities are trusted to issue\n   certificates that accurately reflect the allocation
    state of\n   resources as per their databases.  However, there is some risk that
    a\n   CA will make inappropriate changes to the RPKI, either accidentally\n   or
    deliberately (e.g., as a result of some form of \"government\n   mandate\").  The
    mechanisms described below, and referred to as\n   \"Suspenders\" are intended
    to address this risk.\n\n   Suspenders enables an INR holder to publish information
    about changes\n   to objects it signs and publishes in the RPKI repository system.\n
    \  This information is made available via a file that is external to the\n   RPKI
    repository, so that Relying Parties (RPs) can detect erroneous\n   or malicious
    changes related to these objects.  RPs can then decide,\n   individually, whether
    to accept changes that are not corroborated by\n   independent assertions by INR
    holders, or to revert to previously\n   verified RPKI data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
