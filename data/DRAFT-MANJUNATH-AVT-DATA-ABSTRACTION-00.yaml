abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Meeting quality of service (QoS) in a network is \nchallenging.
    DiffServe architecture, given in [RFC2474] has \nbeen proposed as a solution.
    However, it results in a \nkind of self-simlalarity in the network traffic. The
    method \nresults in the reduction of bit rates and discard of \ncells during congestion.
    It requires re transmission of \nthe same data. Alternatively, the information
    input can be \nreduced with hierarchical arrangement of data in to different \nlevels
    of abstraction. With the increased load on the network, \nthe complexity of meeting
    QoS and the issues of congestion \nare to be transferred to the receiver from
    the network. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
