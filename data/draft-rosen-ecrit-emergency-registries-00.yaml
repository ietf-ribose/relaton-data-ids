abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing
    standards based on IETF emergency call standards and other IETF protocols. There
    is a desire among these organizations to use common registries not tied to a particular
    country or national SDO, in the long term pursuit of a single worldwide standard.
    This document asks IANA to create a set of registries and provides processes for
    expanding the set and populating them.</p>"
