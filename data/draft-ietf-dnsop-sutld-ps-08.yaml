abstract:
- content: <p>The policy defined in RFC 6761 for IANA registrations in the "Special-Use
    Domain Names" registry has been shown, through experience, to present challenges
    that were not anticipated when RFC 6761 was written. This memo presents a list,
    intended to be comprehensive, of the problems that have since been identified.
    In addition, it reviews the history of domain names and summarizes current IETF
    publications and some publications from other organizations relating to Special-Use
    Domain Names. This document should be considered required reading for IETF participants
    who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of Special-Use Domain Names.</p>
