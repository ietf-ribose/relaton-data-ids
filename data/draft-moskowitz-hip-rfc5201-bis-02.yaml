abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol(HIP).
    HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish andmaintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifierand locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity ofcommunications across IP address changes. HIP is
    based on a SIGMA-compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiersfrom
    a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.The protocol is designed
    to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
    When used together withanother suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulated
    SecurityPayload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optionalencryption
    for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.This document obsoletes RFC 5201
    and addresses the concerns raised bythe IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.
    It also incorporateslessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.</p>"
