abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses about the framework of Orchestrator
    in the\n   NFV deployment.  A hierarchical framework of Orchestrator is then\n
    \  proposed.  Such framework is very important for large scale NFV\n   deployment
    in Operator networks, since multi-site of NFV deployment\n   and management should
    be considered.  This draft will further discuss\n   the responsibilities of the
    multi-layers of the Orchestrator and the\n   interfaces between them.\n\n\t </p>\n
