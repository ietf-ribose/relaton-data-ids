abstract:
  content: "<p>Internet mail has operated as an open and unfetteredchannel between
    originator and recipient. This invitessome abuses, called spam, such as burdening
    recipientswith unwanted commercial email. Spam has become anextremely serious
    problem, is getting much worse and isproving difficult (or impossible) to eliminate.
    Themost practical goal is to bring spam under control; itwill require an on-going,
    adaptive effort, withstochastic rather than complete results. This notediscusses
    available points of control in the Internetmail architecture, considerations in
    using any of thosepoints, and opportunities for creating Internetstandards to
    aid in spam control efforts. It offersguidance about likely trade-offs, benefits
    andlimitations.</p>"
