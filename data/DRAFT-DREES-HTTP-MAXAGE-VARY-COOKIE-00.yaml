abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The maxage-vary-cookie HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows\nan
    origin server to instruct caches to serve a stale response if the\nDate header
    field-value received with the response is greater than a\nspecified date-valued
    request cookie.  It can be used to implement a\nsimple view consistency mechanism
    for read/write applications while\nextending freshness lifetimes, reducing latency,
    bandwidth usage, and\norigin server load in some situations.\n\t </p>\n      "
