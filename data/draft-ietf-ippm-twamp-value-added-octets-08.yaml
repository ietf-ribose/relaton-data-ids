abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to the TWAMP test protocol for identifying
    and managing packet trains, which enables measuring capacity metrics like the
    available path capacity, tight section capacity and UDP delivery rate in the forward
    and reverse path directions. This memo contains the description of a working prototype.
    It does not represent a consensus of the IETF community. The IETF community is
    currently working on the problem statement and has not reached consensus on the
    preferred method for measuring capacity metrics.</p>"
