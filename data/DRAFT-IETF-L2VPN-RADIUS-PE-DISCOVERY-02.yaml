abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a strategy by which Provider Equipment
    (PE)\n   can be dynamically provisioned for inclusion in PE-based Layer 2\n   Virtual
    Private Networks (L2VPNs).  This layered strategy utilizes\n   the Remote Authentication
    Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol as a\n   centralized control mechanism
    and can be used in conjunction with\n   other proposed mechanisms.  The mechanisms
    described in this document\n   enhance those established by RFC 2868 and conform
    to those described\n   by the L2VPN Framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
