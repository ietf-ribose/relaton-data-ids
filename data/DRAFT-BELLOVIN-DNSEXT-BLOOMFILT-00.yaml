abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some aspects of DNSSEC, such as NXDOMAIN error messages, require
    an\nauthenticated answer.  Producing this answer requires complex\nmechanisms,
    online storage of the zone's secret key, expensive online\ncomputations, or massive
    zone files.  As an alternative, we propose\nstorage of authenticated pointers
    to Bloom filters.  This scheme\nprovides large reductions in the size of, and
    computational expense\nto produce, partially-signed zone files.\n\t </p>\n      "
