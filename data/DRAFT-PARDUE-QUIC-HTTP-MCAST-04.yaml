abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a profile of the QUIC protocol and
    the HTTP/3\n   mapping that facilitates the transfer of HTTP resources over\n
    \  multicast IP using the QUIC transport as its framing and\n   packetisation
    layer.  Compatibility with the QUIC protocol's syntax\n   and semantics is maintained
    as far as practical and additional\n   features are specified where this is not
    possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
