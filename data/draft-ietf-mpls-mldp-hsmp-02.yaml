abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (or HSMP LSP
    for short), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also
    leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path. That means traffic entering the
    HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream to each
    leaf node, exactly as if it is travelling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each
    leaf node. Upstream traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream
    along the tree to the root, as if it is unicast to the root, and strictly follows
    the downstream path of the tree rather than routing protocol based unicast path
    to the root.</p>"
