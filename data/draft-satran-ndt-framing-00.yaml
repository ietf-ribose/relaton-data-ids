abstract:
- content: "<p>During the last year several attempts have been made to provide a generalized
    framing mechanism for protocols using TCP. The main pur- pose of those mechanisms
    is to enable hardware network adapter builders to discover fast the next Upper
    Layer Protocol Data Unit boundary and thus minimize the amount of memory required
    on the network adapters in order to handle packet drop or reordering in the network.</p>"
