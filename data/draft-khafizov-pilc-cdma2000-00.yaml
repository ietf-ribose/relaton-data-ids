abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of this document is to inform the Internet community
    ofthe TCP optimization techniques that were found useful fortransmitting data
    over the CDMA2000 1x network. Our recommendationsare based on lab measurements
    and simulations of FTP datatransmissions over the CDMA2000 1x systems. Same recommendationscould
    be applicable to networks with similar characteristics (e.g.,W-CDMA, GPRS, etc.)
    and therefore could be incorporated into theexisting document addressing performance
    implications of 2.5G/3Gnetworks [3].This document does not specify an Internet
    standard and it does notpropose any changes to an Internet standard.</p>"
