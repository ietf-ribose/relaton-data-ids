abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to include an\n
    \  additional authorization flow for single page applications called the\n   assisted
    token flow.  It enables OAuth clients written in scripting\n   languages, like
    JavaScript, to request user authorization using a\n   simplified method compared
    to other flows.  Communication does not\n   rely on redirection of the user agent,
    but instead leverages HTML's\n   iframe element, child windows, and the postMessage
    interface.  This\n   communication is done using an additional endpoint, the assisted\n
    \  token endpoint.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
