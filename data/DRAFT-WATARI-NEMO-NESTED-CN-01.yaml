abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document aims at assisting the problem statement of route\n
    \  optimization in nested mobile networks.  We describe the paths\n   packets
    would take using existing Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support\n   mechanisms when
    one or both end nodes of a communication flow are\n   located in a nested NEMO.
    \ One of both of the end nodes may\n   themselves be either mobile nodes performing
    Mobile IPv6, or standard\n   IPv6 nodes performing no mobility function at all.
    \ The path can\n   become extremely suboptimal if no optimization is provided.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
