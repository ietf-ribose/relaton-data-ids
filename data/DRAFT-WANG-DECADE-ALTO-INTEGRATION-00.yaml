abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While DECADE architecture is going to provide a framework to
    use in-\n   network storage with standard interface for content distribution,\n
    \  there are still cases when many in-network storage servers provide\n   the
    same content.  Then traffic optimization mechanism is needed to\n   select one
    best replica for the user request.  This document is going\n   to discuss the
    integration of Application Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO) protocol into
    DECADE so as to optimize network traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
