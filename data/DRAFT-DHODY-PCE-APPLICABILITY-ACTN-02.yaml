abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the
    set of\n   virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage\n
    \  large-scale multi-domain TE networks so as to facilitate network\n   programmability,
    automation, efficient resource sharing, and end-to-\n   end virtual service aware
    connectivity and network function\n   virtualization services.\n\n   The Path
    Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n   mechanisms for
    Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computations in response
    to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n\n   This document examines the
    applicability of PCE to the ACTN\n   framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
