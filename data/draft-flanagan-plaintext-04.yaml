abstract:
- content: <p>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was
    made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML. The high-level
    requirements for the format of RFCs were defined in RFC6949, "RFC Series Format
    Requirements and Future Development." Several different publication formats will
    be rendered from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and EPUB. This
    draft documents the change in requirements and layout for the plain-text RFC publication
    format.</p>
