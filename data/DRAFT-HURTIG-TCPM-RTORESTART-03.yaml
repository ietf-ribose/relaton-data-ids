abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the
    TCP and\n   SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when
    a\n   connection's amount of outstanding data is small.  The modification\n   allows
    the transport to restart its retransmission timer more\n   aggressively in situations
    where fast retransmit cannot be used.\n   This enables faster loss detection and
    recovery for connections that\n   are short-lived or application-limited.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
