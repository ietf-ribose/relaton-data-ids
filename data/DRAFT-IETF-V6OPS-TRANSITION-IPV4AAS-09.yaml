abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements
    for\n   an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router, either provided by the service\n   provider
    or through the retail market.\n\n   Specifically, this document extends the \"Basic
    Requirements for IPv6\n   Customer Edge Routers\" in order to allow the provisioning
    of IPv6\n   transition services for the support of \"IPv4 as-a-Service\" (IPv4aaS)\n
    \  by means of new transition mechanisms.  The document only covers\n   transition
    technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only access\n   networks, commonly called
    \"IPv4 as-a-Service\" (IPv4aaS).  This is\n   required in a world where public
    IPv4 addresses are no longer\n   available for every possible customer.  However,
    devices or\n   applications in the customer LANs may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only
    and\n   still need to communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet.\n\n\t
