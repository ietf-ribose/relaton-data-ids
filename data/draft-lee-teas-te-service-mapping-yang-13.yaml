abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service models
    (e.g., the L3VPM Service Model) to Traffic Engineering (TE) models (e.g., the
    TE Tunnel or the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks Virtual
    Network model). This model is referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and is applicable
    generically to the operator's need for seamless control and management of their
    VPN services with TE tunnel support. The model is principally used to allow monitoring
    and diagnostics of the management systems to show how the service requests are
    mapped onto underlying network resource and TE models.</p>"
