abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS) architecture facilitates
    the\n   attestation of device characteristics that, in general, are based on\n
    \  specific trustworthiness qualities intrinsic to a device or service.\n   It
    includes trusted computing functionality provided by device\n   hardware and software
    that allows trustworthiness qualities to be\n   asserted and verified as part
    of, or pre-requisite to, the device's\n   normal operation.  The RATS architecture
    maps corresponding\n   attestation functions and capabilities to specific RATS
    Roles.  The\n   goal is to enable an appropriate conveyance of evidence about
    device\n   trustworthiness via network protocols.  RATS Roles provide the\n   endpoint
    context for understanding the various interaction semantics\n   of the attestation
    lifecycle.  The RATS architecture provides the\n   building block concepts, semantics,
    syntax and framework for\n   interoperable attestation while remaining hardware-agnostic.
    \ This\n   flexibility is intended to address a significant variety of use-cases\n
    \  and scenarios involving interoperable attestation.  Example usages\n   include,
    but are not limited to: financial transactions, voting\n   machines, critical
    safety systems, network equipment health, or\n   trustworthy end-user device management.
    \ Existing industry\n   attestation efforts may be helpful toward informing RATS\n
    \  architecture.  Such as: Remote Integrity VERification (RIVER), the\n   creation
    of Entity Attestation Tokens (EAT), software integrity\n   Measurement And ATtestation
    (MAAT)\n\n\t </p>\n      "
