abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Where multiple application servers are able to receive inbound\nconnections
    from clients, it is desirable provide some policy control\nover client behaviour.
    \ This specification allows application service\nproviders to provide addresses
    of multiple servers in response to DNS\nqueries, while specifying failover and
    load balancing behaviours.\n\nMultiple servers are specified using existing protocol
    mechanisms for\nDNS Service records (SRV).  An experimental record definition
    is\ndescribed, which can be implemented on existing systems.\n\t </p>\n      "
