abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed\n
    \  approach is needed to Mobile IPv6.  This document defines a\n   distributed
    mobility management protocol with multicast support.\n   Protocol is based on
    Mobile IPv6 and its extensions for multiple care\n   of address registration,
    flow mobility and dual stack mobile IPv6\n   with minimum extensions.  Control
    and data plane separation is\n   achieved by separating Home Agent functionalities
    into the control\n   and data planes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
