abstract:
- content: "<p>In an increasingly complex internet it is becoming more common for
    endpoints to want to influence the behavior of network devices, and for those
    devices to want to communicate with endpoints for autho- rization and policy discover.
    Frameworks and protocols are evolv- ing for communication with application intermediaries
    and with net- work edge policy enforcement devices. One area that has received
    relatively little attention to date is communication between end- points and transport
    intermediaries. This document presents a problem statement and an overview of
    different communication mod- els.</p>"
