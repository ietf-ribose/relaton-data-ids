abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes the general problem of encrypting the Server Name
    Identification (SNI) TLS parameter. The proposed solutions hide a Hidden Service
    behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI of the fronting service to
    external observers. The draft lists known attacks against SNI encryption, discusses
    the current "co-tenancy fronting" solution, and presents requirements for future
    TLS layer solutions. In practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every
    requirement, and that practical solutions will have to make some compromises.</p>
