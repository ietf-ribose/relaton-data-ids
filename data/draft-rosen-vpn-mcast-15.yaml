abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the MVPN (Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) solution
    designed and deployed by Cisco Systems. The procedures specified in this document
    are largely a subset of the generalized MVPN framework recently standardized by
    the IETF. However, as the deployment of the procedures specified herein predates
    the publication of IETF standards (in some cases by over five years), an implementation
    based on these procedures differs in some respects from a fully standards-compliant
    implementation. These differences are pointed out in the document. This document
    defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>"
