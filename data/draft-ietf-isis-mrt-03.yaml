abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to IS-IS to support the distributed
    computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT). Example uses of MRT include IP/LDP
    Fast-Reroute and global protection or live-live for multicast traffic. The extensions
    indicate what MRT profile(s) each router supports. Different MRT profiles can
    be defined to support different uses and to allow transition of capabilities.
    An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible links, due to administrative
    policy. This document also defines the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV, which is
    useful for MRT FRR as well as other applications.</p>"
