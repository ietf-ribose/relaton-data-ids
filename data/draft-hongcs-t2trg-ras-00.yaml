abstract:
  content: "\t <t>An efficient resource allocation scheme directly affects the overallsystem's
    network utilization, and notably, the wireless resource suchas bandwidth is itself
    an expensive commodity. In this regards, toaddress the requirement of massively
    increased IoT traffic at theedge, as a solution approach, a number of small cell
    base stations(SBSs) have been deployed with certain computational capabilities.However,
    it is still limited, and any inappropriate resourceallocation scheme for the associated
    nodes with trafficcharacterized by ultra-reliability and low-latency (URLLC)requirements
    can impact the system's resource utilization andperformance. Considering a reserve
    resource for such kind of traffic,the resource allocation problem in each time
    slot behaves as a nodeselection problem with contention amongst active nodes for
    theresource. In this paper, we have formulated this as an index problem,and with
    simulation results have shown that the cumulative reward interms of network utility
    is maximized following this approach.</p>"
