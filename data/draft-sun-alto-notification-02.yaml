abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances
    notonly the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiencesof end
    users. To design the information exchanging protocol andarchitecture that facilitate
    such cooperation is the objective ofApplication-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    working group.Currently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response messagebased
    on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannotsupport rapid dispatch
    of ALTO information. Noted that many scenariosrequire the updated network information
    to be dispatched to clients assoon as possible, such as when part of the network
    is congested, when anew policy is to be deployed urgently, or when unexpected
    networkmaintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this draft proposed aserver
    notification extension to the original query/response mechanism.</p>"
