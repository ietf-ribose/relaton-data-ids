abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a distributed system that provides the\nmechanisms
    needed for discovering, accessing and processing security\npolicy information
    of hosts, subnets or networks of a security domain.\nIn this system policy clients
    and servers exchange information using\nthe Security Policy Protocol. The protocol
    defines how the policy\ninformation is exchanged, processed, and protected by
    clients and\nservers. The system accommodates topology changes, hence policy\nchanges,
    rather easily without the scalability constraints imposed by\nstatic reconfiguration
    of each client. The protocol is extensible and\nflexible. It allows the exchange
    of complex policy objects between\nclients and servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
