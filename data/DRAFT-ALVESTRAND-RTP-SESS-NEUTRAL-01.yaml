abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is not intended for publication as an RFC.\n\n
    \  It gives the underpinning arguments for why the idea that RTP\n   sessions
    and MIME top level types are related is a deeply broken\n   paradigm, and that
    we need to get away from it.\n\n   These arguments are solely the opinion of the
    listed author.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
