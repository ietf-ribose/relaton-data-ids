abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism whereby, in response to a AAA request,
    a AAA server may refer a client to another server, which will then directly handle
    requests from that client. This is in contrast to a proxy mechanism, where one
    AAA server acts as an intermediary, communicating with another AAA server on behalf
    of the AAA client. An implementation of this mechanism for Dial Access AAA is
    presented using the RADIUS protocol.</p>"
