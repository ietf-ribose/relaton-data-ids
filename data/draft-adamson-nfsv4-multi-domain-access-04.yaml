abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network File System, version 4 (NFSv4) uses a representation of
    identity that allows the use of users and groups from multiple, distinct administrative
    domains, and NFSv4 allows the use of security mechanisms that authenticate principals
    from multiple, distinct administrative domains. This document describes methods
    by which NFSv4 clients and servers can handle principals, users, groups from multiple
    administrative domains.</p>"
