abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such
    as CNAME\n   (Canonical Name), where a query can be redirected to a different\n
    \  name. A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used\n   for
    indicating errors, and response status bits. This document\n   clarifies, in the
    case of such redirected queries, how the RCODE and\n   status bits correspond
    to the initial query cycle (where the CNAME or\n   the like was detected) and
    subsequent or final query cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
