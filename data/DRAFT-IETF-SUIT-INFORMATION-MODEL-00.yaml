abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have
    raised the\n   need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also\n
    \  suitable for constrained devices.  Incorporating such update\n   mechanism
    to fix vulnerabilities, to update configuration settings as\n   well as adding
    new functionality is recommended by security experts.\n\n   One component of such
    a firmware update is the meta-data, or\n   manifest, that describes the firmware
    image(s) and offers appropriate\n   protection.  This document describes all the
    information that must be\n   present in the manifest.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
