abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Historically, Internet Standards have been characterized by threeprimary
    criteria: the specifications are stable, implementations ofthem have been demonstrated
    to be interoperable, and they haveachieved sufficient deployment to be considered
    useful. The IETF hasdeveloped specific rules for determining whether those criteria
    havebeen met, but the rules and their implementation have sometimes notadequately
    reflected those underlying criteria. The result has beenthat the application of
    the rules has not resulted in STDs for allprotocols that meet the underlying criteria.
    This document proposesa process experiment to reclassify standards-track documents
    whoseinteroperability and utility have been demonstrated by the fact ofdeployment
    and use in products being used by Internet users.</p>"
