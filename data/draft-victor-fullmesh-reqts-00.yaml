abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo enumerates requirements to realize full-mesh multiparty conferencing
    using baseline Session Initiation Protocol. Primary requirement is to advertise
    conference membersâ€™ addresses to new participants by concatenating multiple SDP
    session descriptions together. This particular requirement can solve several well-known
    problems, including disjoint meshes and race conditions, that are lingering in
    full-mesh conferencing for a while now.</p>"
