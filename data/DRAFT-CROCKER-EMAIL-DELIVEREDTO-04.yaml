abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The address to which email is delivered might be different
    than any\n   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were\n
    \  created by the email author.  The address used by the email transport\n   service
    is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP \"RCPT TO\"\n   command.  Before
    final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of\n   submission/delivery events,
    using different destination addresses,\n   that lead to the recipient.  It can
    be helpful for a message to have\n   a common way to record each delivery in such
    a sequence, and to\n   include each address used for that recipient.  This document
    defines\n   a header field for this information.\n\n   Email handling information
    is a matter of modifying the email\n   infrastructure and possibly creating privacy
    concerns.  A header\n   field such as this is not automatically assured of adoption
    or use.\n   Therefore it is being published as an Experiment, looking for\n   constituency
    and for operational utility.\n\n   This document is produced through the Independent
    RFC stream and was\n   not subject to the IETF's approval process.\n\n\t </p>\n
