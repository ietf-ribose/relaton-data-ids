abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm\n
    \  augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation\n   avoidance.
    \ This document describes a number of niches where Babel\n   has been found to
    be useful and that are arguably not adequately\n   served by more mature protocols.\n\n\t
