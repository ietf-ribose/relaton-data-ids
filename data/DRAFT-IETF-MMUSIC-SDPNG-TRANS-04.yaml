abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in
    the\nInternet to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions and\nexchange
    capabilities.  Having originally been designed for session\nannouncements only,
    as opposed to announcements and capabilities\nnegotiation announcements, native
    SDP lacks numerous features to be\napplicable in many session scenarios.  Numerous
    extensions have been\ndeveloped to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have
    also\nrepeatedly shown its inherent limitations.  A successor protocol --\ntermed
    'SDPng' for the time being -- is developed to address the\naforementioned needs
    of Internet applications in a more structured\nmanner.  With the huge installed
    base of SDP-based applications, a\nmigration path needs to be developed to move
    from SDP to SDPng over\ntime.  This document outlines how this migration can be
    achieved: in\ngeneral as well as for the various IETF control protocols that\npotentially
    make use of SDP and SDPng.\n\t </p>\n      "
