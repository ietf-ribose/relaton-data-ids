abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies proactive, in-band network OAM mechanisms to
    detect loss of continuity and miss-connection faults that affect unicast and multi-destination
    paths (used by Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast traffic) in an Ethernet
    VPN (EVPN) network. The mechanisms specified in the draft are based on the widely
    adopted Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.</p>"
