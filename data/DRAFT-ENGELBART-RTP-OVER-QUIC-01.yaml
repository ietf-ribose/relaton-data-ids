  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a minimal mapping for encapsulating
    RTP and\n   RTCP packets within QUIC.  It also discusses how to leverage state\n
    \  from the QUIC implementation in the endpoints to reduce the exchange\n   of
    RTCP packets.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document takes place on the mailing list (),
    which\n   is archived at .\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can
