abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and
    as a \n   consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has
    \n   been developed and is currently being deployed.  RFC 3471 [RFC3471] \n   has
    defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) \"only has \n   significance
    between two neighbors\".  However, in a network composed \n   of a new generation
    of lambda switch-capable equipment, this document \n   explains new models that
    require standardization of the label.  It \n   highlights new operator requirements
    and describes signaling \n   extensions to satisfy those requirements. \n\n   This
    document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label \n   Switching
    (GMPLS) signaling.  It defines the Label Switching Capable \n   (LSC) technology
    specific information needed when using GMPLS.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
