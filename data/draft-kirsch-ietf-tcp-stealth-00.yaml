abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP servers are visible on the Internet to unauthorized clients, as
    the existence of a TCP server is leaked in the TCP handshake before applications
    have a chance to authenticate the client. We present a small modification to the
    initial TCP handshake that allows TCP clients to replace the TCP ISN in the TCP
    SYN packet with an authorization token. Based on this information, TCP servers
    may then chose to obscure their presence from unauthorized TCP clients. This RFC
    documents the specific method for calculating the authorization token to ensure
    interoperability and to minimize interference by middleboxes. Mandating support
    for this method in operating system TCP/IP implementation will ensure that clients
    can connect to TCP servers protected by this method.</p>"
