abstract:
  content: "<p>The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol formaintaining
    coherence among a zone's authoritative name serversconsists of three mechanisms.
    Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) isone of the mechanisms and originally was defined
    in RFC 1995.This document aims to provide a more detailed and up-to-datespecification
    of the IXFR mechanism and to align it with the currentspecification of the primary
    zone transfer mechanism, AXFR, given inRFC 5936. Further, based on operational
    experience, this documentjuxtaposes to the original IXFR query a new query type,
    IXFR-ONLY,that will likely be preferred over IXFR in specific deployments.This
    document obsoletes and replaces RFC 1995.DiscussionThis draft targets adoption
    by the DNSEXT working group. Commentsshould be sent to the authors and/or the
    namedroppers mailing list.</p>"
