abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8287 defines the extensions to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute
    for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with
    the MPLS data plane. RFC 8287 proposes three Target Forwarding Equivalence Class
    (FEC) Stack sub-TLVs. While RFC 8287 defines the format and procedure to handle
    those sub-TLVs, it does not sufficiently clarify how the length of the Segment
    ID sub-TLVs should be computed to be included in the Length field of the sub-TLVs.
    This ambiguity has resulted in interoperability issues. This document updates
    RFC 8287 by clarifying the length of each of the Segment ID sub-TLVs defined in
    RFC 8287.</p>"
