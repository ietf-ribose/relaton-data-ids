abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a generic algorithm for a transport
    protocol\n   sender to estimate the current delivery rate of its data.  At a high\n
    \  level, the algorithm estimates the rate at which the network\n   delivered
    the most recent flight of outbound data packets for a\n   single flow.  In addition,
    it tracks whether the rate sample was\n   application-limited, meaning the transmission
    rate was limited by the\n   sending application rather than the congestion control
    algorithm.\n   This algorithm can be implemented in any transport protocol that\n
    \  supports packet-delivery acknowledgment (thus far, open source\n   implementations
    are available for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000]).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
