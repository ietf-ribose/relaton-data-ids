abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to prevent the impersonation of telephone numbers on
    the Internet, some kind of credential system needs to exist that cryptographically
    asserts authority over telephone numbers.  This document describes the use of
    certificates in establishing authority over telephone numbers, as a component
    of a broader architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in protocols
    like SIP.\n\t </p>\n      "
