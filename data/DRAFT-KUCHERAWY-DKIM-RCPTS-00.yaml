abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) protocol applies a domain-level\n
    \  cryptographic signature to an e-mail message.  DKIM only guarantees\n   authenticity
    of the message content and does not consider the message\n   envelope.  This allows
    for replay attacks by recycling a signed\n   message with an arbitrary new set
    of recipients.\n\n   This document presents a protocol extension that can include
    the\n   original set of envelope recipients in the signed content, so that an\n
    \  altered set of recipients renders the signature invalid.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
