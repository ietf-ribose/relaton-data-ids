abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications)
    are widely\n   used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic
    in\n   many networks.  One technique to improve the network efficiency of\n   these
    applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the\n   networks; this
    is the capability provided by a DECADE (DECoupled\n   Application Data Enroute)
    compatible system.  This document presents\n   an architecture, discusses the
    underlying principles, and identifies\n   key functionalities in the architecture
    for introducing a DECADE in-\n   network storage system.  In addition, some examples
    are given to\n   illustrate these concepts.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
