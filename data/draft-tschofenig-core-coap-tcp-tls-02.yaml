abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been designed with TCP as
    an underlying transport protocol. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    which has been inspired by HTTP, has on the other hand been defined to make use
    of UDP. Therefore, reliable delivery and a simple congestion control and flow
    control mechanism are provided by the message layer of the CoAP protocol. A number
    of environments benefit from the use of CoAP directly over a reliable byte stream
    that already provides these services. This document defines the use of CoAP over
    TCP as well as CoAP over TLS.</p>"
