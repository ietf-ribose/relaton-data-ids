abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification clarifies \"Capabilities Update\" in OPEN state\ndefined
    in RFC 3588bis.  Capabilities update in OPEN state can reuse\ncommands CER/CEA
    commands for re-negotiation between Diameter peers\nwhen one of them changes its
    capabilities.It is a very important\nfunction in Diameter.\n\nHowever, RFC 3588
    has defined a mechanism of containing capabilities\nlist both in CER and CEA commands
    and the peer should update its\nlocal database whenever it receives CER/CEA.  This
    makes the process\ncomplex and redundant when they are used in OPEN state.  So
    this\ndraft proposes a simpler solution based on CER/CEA commands to deal\nwith
    this problem.\n\t </p>\n      "
