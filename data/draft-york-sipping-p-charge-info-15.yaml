abstract:
- content: "<p>This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing information about the
    party to be charged. This P-Header is currently in production usage by a number
    of equipment vendors and carriers and this document is submitted to request the
    registration of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also be used in some
    situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN interconnection.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the Internet Draft will be the last with this
    name, as the SIPPING Working Group no longer exists. The next version of this
    Internet Draft will be through the DISPATCH Working Group and will be draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info-00.</p>"
