abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ivip (Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing) is a Core-Edge Separation\nsolution
    to the routing scaling problem, for both IPv4 and IPv6.  It\nprovides portable
    address \"edge\" address space which is suitable for\nmultihoming and inbound
    traffic engineering (TE) to end-user networks\nof all types and sizes - in a manner
    which imposes far less load on\nthe DFZ control plane than the only current method
    of achieving these\nbenefits: separately advertised PI prefixes.  Ivip includes
    two\nextensions for ITR-to-ETR tunneling without encapsulation and the\nPath MTU
    Discovery problems which result from encapsulation - one for\nIPv4 and the other
    for IPv6.  Both involve modifying the IP header\nand require most DFZ routers
    to be upgraded.  Ivip is a good basis\nfor the TTR (Translating Tunnel Router)
    approach to mobility, in\nwhich mobile hosts retain an SPI micronet of one or
    more IPv4\naddresses (or IPv6 /64s) no matter what addresses or access network\nthey
    are using, including behind NAT and on SPI addresses.  TTR\nmobility for both
    IPv4 and IPv6 involves generally optimal paths,\nworks with unmodified correspondent
    hosts and supports all\napplication protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
