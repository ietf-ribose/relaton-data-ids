abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In various network deployments, end to end paths are partitioned
    into\n   multiple segments.  In some cloud based WAN connections, multiple\n   overlay
    tunnels in series are used to achieve better path selection\n   and lower latency.
    \ In satellite communication, the end to end path\n   is split into two terrestrial
    segments and a satellite segment.\n   Packet losses can be caused both by random
    events or congestion in\n   various deployments.\n\n   Traditional end-to-end
    transport layers respond to packet loss slowly\n   especially in long-haul networks:
    They either wait for some signal\n   from the receiver to indicate a loss and
    then retransmit from the\n   sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often
    quite long.  Non-\n   congestion caused packet loss may make the TCP sender over-reduce
    the\n   sending rate unnecessarily.  With end-to-end encryption moving under\n
    \  the transport (QUIC), traditional PEP (performance enhancing proxy)\n   techniques
    such as TCP splitting are no longer applicable.\n\n   LOOPS (Local Optimizations
    on Path Segments) aims to provide non end-\n   to-end, locally based in-network
    recovery to achieve better data\n   delivery by making packet loss recovery faster
    and by avoiding the\n   senders over-reducing their sending rate.  In an overlay
    network\n   scenario, LOOPS can be performed over the existing, or purposely\n
    \  created, overlay tunnel based path segments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
