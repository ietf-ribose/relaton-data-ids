abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes extensions for the flow control of the\nTransmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) that avoid interactions with fast\nstartup congestion control
    mechanisms, in particular the Quick-Start\nTCP extension.  Quick-Start is an optional
    TCP extension that allows\nto start data transfers with a large congestion window,
    using\nfeedback of the routers along the path.  This can avoid the time\nconsuming
    Slow-Start, provided that the TCP flow control is not a\nlimiting factor.\nThere
    are two potential interactions between the TCP flow control and\ncongestion control
    schemes without the standard Slow-Start: First,\nreceivers might not allocate
    a sufficiently large buffer space after\nconnection setup, or they may advertise
    a receive window implicitly\nassuming the Slow-Start behavior on the sender side.
    \ This document\ntherefore provides guidelines for buffer allocation in hosts\nsupporting
    the Quick-Start extension.  Second, the TCP receive window\nscaling mechanism
    can prevent fast startups immediately after the\ninitial three-way handshake connection
    setup.  This document\ndescribes a simple solution to overcome this problem.\n\t
