abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architecture for the communication
    between \nBorder Routers (BR) and a Bandwidth Broker (BB) in a MPLS/DiffServ \ncore
    network. This architecture is based on the Common Open Policy \nService (COPS)
    protocol and defines a new Client Type extension for it. This specification applies
    basically to intra-domain MPLS/DiffServ \nnetwork scenarios. However, the same
    extensions to COPS are suitable \nfor inter-domain communications, when MPLS Label
    Switched Paths (LSP) \nwith QoS-DiffServ guarantees are established across multiple
    \nMPLS/DiffServ islands. Therefore, this document provides also a \nsimple and
    efficient model for inter-BB communication. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
