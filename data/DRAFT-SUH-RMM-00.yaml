abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new protocol, namely, Regional Mobile
    IPv6 \nmobility management (RMM/RMIPv6). RMM mechanism satisfies the LMM \nrequirements
    while it is more flexible mobility management scheme \nthan existing solution,
    for example HMIPv6. This document therefore\ndescribes methods to be used to reduce
    the amount of signaling to\nthe Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes. In addition,
    this scheme \nis flexible enough to adapt to any network topology assumed by \nIPv6.
    The network that using RMM/RMIPv6 is robust against the failure \nor the performance
    degradation. The mechanism is intended to reuse \nthe Care of Address. Moreover,
    the forwarding tunnel length from \nan anchor point to a Mobile Node can be a
    controllable or \nconfigurable. \n\t </p>\n      "
