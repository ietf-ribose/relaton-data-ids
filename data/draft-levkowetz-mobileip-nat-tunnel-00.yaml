abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IP is now being deployed, providing connectivity to mobileusers.
    This is happening well ahead of the widespread use of IPv6,which may not have
    been expected at the time when the Mobile IPstandard was originally formulated.
    At the same time, networks withprivate address spaces are proliferating, using
    NAT devices to reachthe public internet. Today NATs are widely deployed in homegateways,
    as well as in other locations likely to be used by mobileusers, such as hotels.
    The result is that MIP-NAT incompatibilityissues have become a major barrier to
    deployment of Mobile IP in oneof its principal uses. This draft describes a known
    incompatibilitybetween NAT and Mobile IP, and also describes a possible solutionusing
    Mobile IP's vendor specific extensions.</p>"
