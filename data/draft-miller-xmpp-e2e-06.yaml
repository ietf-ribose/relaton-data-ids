abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two methods for securing objects (often referred
    to as stanzas) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which
    allows for efficient asynchronous communication between two entities, each with
    might have multiple devices operating simultaneously. One is a method to encrypt
    stanzas to provide confidentiality protection; another is a method to sign stanzas
    to provide authentication and integrity protection. This document also defines
    a related protocol for entities to request the ephemeral session keys in use.</p>"
