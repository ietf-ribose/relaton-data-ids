abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a method for multihoming support inapplication
    layer. We extend the basic socket API(ApplicationProgramming Interface) and propose
    some new interfaces formultihoming. Multihoming nodes are expected to have multipleaddresses.
    The existing socket APIs, however, are not designed tomanipulate multiple addresses
    in a connection. Proposed APIs help anapplication to handle multiple addresses,
    to avoid connection failureand to do load-balancing possibly. Right now, the proposed
    APIs arefor LIN6 nodes, one of the mobile protocols. This is because LIN6'saddressing
    architecture, which is called '8+8', is very friendly andconsistent with multihoming.
    In this document, we propose a host-based multihoming solution and which is called
    end-to-endmultihoming. In end-to-end multihoming, a fault-tolerant connectioncan
    be achieved relying not on routers but on the pair of end-nodesonly.</p>"
