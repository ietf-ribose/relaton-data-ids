abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a functional requirement of Message
    Level\n   Security (MLS) which provide an efficient management for multiple\n
    \  groups.  Although MLS defines an architecture and an abstract\n   protocol
    for a secure group communication, it overlooks the need of\n   multiple groups.
    \ This document describes a usecase of the multiple\n   groups, and the need for
    an efficient multiple group membership\n   management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
