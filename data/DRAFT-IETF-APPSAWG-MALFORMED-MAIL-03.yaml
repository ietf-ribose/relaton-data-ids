abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The email ecosystem has long had a very permissive set of common\n
    \  processing rules in place, despite increasingly rigid standards\n   governing
    its components, ostensibly to improve the user experience.\n   The handling of
    these come at some cost, and various components are\n   faced with decisions about
    whether or not to permit non-conforming\n   messages to continue toward their
    destinations unaltered, adjust them\n   to conform (possibly at the cost of losing
    some of the original\n   message), or outright rejecting them.\n\n   This document
    includes a collection of the best advice available\n   regarding a variety of
    common malformed mail situations, to be used\n   as implementation guidance.  It
    must be emphasized, however, that the\n   intent of this document is not to standardize
    malformations or\n   otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are
    manifestly\n   malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to
    be\n   fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at\n   all
    possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise\n   legitimate
    senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and,\n   unfortunately,
    commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply\n   reject or discard them.
    \ Accordingly, this document presents\n   alternatives for dealing with them in
    ways that seem to do the least\n   additional harm until the infrastructure is
    tightened up to match the\n   standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
