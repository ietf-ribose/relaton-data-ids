abstract:
- content: "<p>Sometimes some SFs of a SFC are provided by several DC networks. That
    means a SFC may cross several SFs in different DC network. How to establish such
    SFC that is across several DCs is what we want to state. In this document, a hierarchical
    SFC method is proposed. It will cover data plane, control plane for such hierarchical
    SFC. And it includes requirements of the SFC Gateway for every DC network that
    provide SF for SFC.</p>"
