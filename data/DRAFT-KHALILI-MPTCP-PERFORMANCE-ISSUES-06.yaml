abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We show, by measurements over a testbed and by mathematical
    analysis,\n   that the current MPTCP suffers from two problems: (P1) Upgrading
    some\n   TCP users to MPTCP can reduce the throughput of others without any\n
    \  benefit to the upgraded users; and (P2) MPTCP users can be\n   excessively
    aggressive towards TCP users. We attribute these problems\n   to the \"Linked
    Increases\" Algorithm (LIA) of MPTCP [4], and more\n   specifically, to an excessive
    amount of traffic transmitted over\n   congested paths. Our results show that
    these problems are important\n   and can be mitigated. We believe that the design
    of the congestion\n   control of MPTCP should be improved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
