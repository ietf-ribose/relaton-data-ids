abstract:
- content: "<p>Kernel metadata is a small prescriptive vocabulary designed to support
    highly uniform but minimal object descriptions for the purpose of orderly collection
    management. The Kernel vocabulary, based on a subset of the Dublin Core (DC) metadata
    element set, aims to describe objects of any form or category, but its reach is
    limited to a small number of fundamental questions such as who, what, when, and
    where. The Electronic Resource Citation (ERC), also specified in this document,
    is an object description that addresses those four questions using Kernel and
    other metadata elements.</p>"
