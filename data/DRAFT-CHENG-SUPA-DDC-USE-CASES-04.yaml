abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Large scale DCs can provide various services and usually have
    a lot\n   of internal and external links, and these links are usually VPNs.\n
    \  The Service provisioning and network connectivity configurations are\n   complex
    and sometimes dynamic, for which manual configuration is not\n   suitable.  This
    draft analyzes the use case in Distributed Data\n   Centers (DDC), in which some
    VPN scenarios are covered, and the\n   applicability of SUPA data models which
    can be used for better\n   resource usage and easy service/network configuration.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
