abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited
    number\nof flows from all of those observed at an observation point to be\nconsidered
    into the measurement process chain.  The flow selection\nprocess can be enabled
    at different stages of the monitoring\nreference model.  It can be performed at
    metering time once the\npacket classification has been executed, i.e. flow state
    dependent\npacket selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting the\nnumber
    of flows to be stored and/or exported to the collector\napplications.  This document
    illustrates the motivations which might\nlead flow selection to be performed and
    presents a classification of\nthe related techniques.  The document furthermore
    provides an\ninformation model for configuring flow selection techniques and\ndiscusses
    what information about the flow selection process is\nbeneficial to be exported
    by adopting a suitable information model.\n\t </p>\n      "
