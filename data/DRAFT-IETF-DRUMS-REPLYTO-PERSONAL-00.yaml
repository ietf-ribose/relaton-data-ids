abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This proposal describes proposed language for the 822bis draft,\ndraft-ietf-drums-msg-fmt-03.txt,
    that clarifies the semantics of\nthe Reply-To header.   The intention is to clarify
    the rather\nvague language in 822bis in a way which preserves compatibility\nwith
    the largest possible subset of existing mail user agents.\n \nThis document should
    be read in conjunction with Jacob Palme's\nMail-Followup-To proposal (draft-ietf-drums-mail-followup-to-00.txt),\nwhich
    the working group chair, Jacob Palme and the author regard as a\nnatural complement
    of this proposal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
