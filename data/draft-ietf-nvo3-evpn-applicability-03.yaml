abstract:
- content: "<p>In NVO3 networks, Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices sit at
    the edge of the underlay network and provide Layer-2 and Layer-3 connectivity
    among Tenant Systems (TSes) of the same tenant. The NVEs need to build and maintain
    mapping tables so that they can deliver encapsulated packets to their intended
    destination NVE(s). While there are different options to create and disseminate
    the mapping table entries, NVEs may exchange that information directly among themselves
    via a control-plane protocol, such as EVPN. EVPN provides an efficient, flexible
    and unified control-plane option that can be used for Layer-2 and Layer-3 Virtual
    Network (VN) service connectivity. This document describes the applicability of
    EVPN to NVO3 networks and how EVPN solves the challenges in those networks.</p>"
