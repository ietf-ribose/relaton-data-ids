abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) is a cryptographic key\n
    \  generated from an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) exchange\n   reserved
    solely for the purpose of deriving master keys for one or\n\n   more purposes
    identified as usage definitions.  This document\n   specifies a mechanism for
    deriving cryptographically separate root\n   keys from the EMSK, called usage
    specific root Keys (USRK).  The\n   document provides a set of requirements for
    avoiding conflicts\n   between usage definitions to ensure this cryptographic
    separation.\n   The USRK is used according to the usage definition defined for
    a\n   specific purpose.\n\t </p>\n      "
