abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type
    that\n   allows resource representations to indicate that they are following\n
    \  one or more profiles.  A profile is defined to not alter the\n   semantics
    of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients\n   to learn about
    additional semantics that are associated with the\n   resource in addition to
    those defined by the media type and possibly\n   other mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n
