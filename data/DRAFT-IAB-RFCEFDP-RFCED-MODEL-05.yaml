abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes updated processes for defining and\n
    \  implementing policies regarding the RFC Series as a whole and thus\n   specifies
    version 3 of RFC Editor Model.  The model defines two high-\n   level tasks related
    to the RFC Series.  Policy definition is the\n   responsibility of the RFC Series
    Working Group (RSWG), which produces\n   policy proposals that are subject to
    approval by the RFC Series\n   Approval Board (RSAB).  Policy implementation is
    primarily the\n   responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the
    ultimate\n   authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF\n
    \  LLC).\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.  This document updates RFC 7841,\n
    \  RFC 8729, and RFC 8730.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
