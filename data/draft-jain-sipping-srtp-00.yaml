abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secured Real Time Protocol (SRTP) is a lightweight protocol that
    secures voice data between two end points. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    is a simple and adaptive session-controlling protocol. Efforts have been underway
    to get these two protocols working together. Several ideas have been presented
    in different documents in past. This document describes one more way to accomplish
    this task. The proposed approach is simple and does not consume too much CPU cycles.
    However, some assumptions need to be made in lack of the specific SIP and SDP
    fields.</p>"
