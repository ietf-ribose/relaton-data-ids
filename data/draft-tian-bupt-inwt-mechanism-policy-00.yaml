abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide telemetry
    framework based on INT(In-band Network Telemetry), by decoupling the network monitoring
    system into a routing mechanism and a routing path generation policy. INT-path
    embed SR(Source Routing) into INT probes to allow specifying the route that the
    probe packet takes through the network. Above this probing path control mechanism,
    an Euler trail-based path planning policy is developed to generate non-overlapped
    INT paths that cover the entire network with a minimum path member, reducing the
    overall telemetry overhead. INT- path is very suitable for deployment in data
    center networks thanks to their symmetric topologies.</p>"
