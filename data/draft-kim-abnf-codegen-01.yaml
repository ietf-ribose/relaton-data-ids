abstract:
  content: <p>This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation. ABNFhas
    been widely used for decades. While its popurarity is ascribed toits simplicity
    and ease of use, the demand for code generationhas been fulfilled only marginally,
    by some sort of non-standardextensions, or by conversion to yet another meta language.
    Onepossible solution is to add more detailed specifications to theexisting ABNF
    standard, but this hurts the very competitiveness ofABNF itself. Another solution
    is to standardize an extension andmake it a 'sister' standard in parallel to the
    existing ABNFstandaard. In this document we propose such an extension as astandard.
    The generated code using the proposed extension would be"complete", meaning no
    need to modify by hand, if there exist noconcepts of unordered groups in the specification.</p>
