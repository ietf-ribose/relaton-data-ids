abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types
    of route\n   leaks are provided in RFC 7908.  This document describes a new well-\n
    \  known Large Community that provides a way for route-leak prevention,\n   detection,
    and mitigation.  The configuration process for this\n   Community can be automated
    with the methodology for setting BGP roles\n   that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy
    draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
