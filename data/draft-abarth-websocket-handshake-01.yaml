abstract:
  content: "<p>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a useragent
    running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to aremote host that
    has opted-in to communications from that code. Thesecurity model used for this
    is the Origin-based security modelcommonly used by Web browsers. The protocol
    consists of an initialhandshake followed by basic message framing, layered over
    TCP. Thegoal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-basedapplications
    that need two-way communication with servers that doesnot rely on opening multiple
    HTTP connections (e.g. usingXMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).Please
    send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
