abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EAP Session-Id derivation has not been defined for EAP-SIM,
    EAP-AKA,\n   and EAP-AKA' when using the fast re-authentication exchange instead\n
    \  of full authentication.  This document updates [RFC5247] to define\n   those
    derivations for EAP-SIM, and EAP-AKA.  Since [AKAP] defines the\n   Session-ID
    for EAP-AKA', the definition for EAP-AKA' is not included\n   here.  [RFC5247]
    also does not define Session-Id derivation for PEAP.\n   A definition is given
    here which follows the definition for other\n   TLS-based EAP methods.\n\n\t </p>\n
