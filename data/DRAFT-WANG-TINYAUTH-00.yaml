abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies basic security standards for authentication\nprotocol
    on Ad hoc. The security standards are based on the ECDH to\ndiscover a authentication
    protocol between two nodes, and on the\nTinyOS simulation platform and Mica nodes.
    This document also\ndefines elements of procedure for authentication protocol,
    including\nSystem Initialization, Key extract and the identity authentication.\nWith
    these standards, authentication between two nodes can be\ncompleted in a certain
    time and a certain circles.\n\t </p>\n      "
