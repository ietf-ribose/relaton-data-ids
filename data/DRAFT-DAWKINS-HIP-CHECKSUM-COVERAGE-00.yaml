abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification suggests two changes to the Host Identity Protocol\n(HIP)
    checksum calculation.  Specifically, only the HIP header and\npayload fields would
    be included in the checksum calculation, and the\nCRC32c algorithm would be used
    to compute the checksum.  The HIP\nversion number would be incremented if these
    suggestions are\naccepted, to reflect a different checksum algorithm.\n\t </p>\n
