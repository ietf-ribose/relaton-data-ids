abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) called one-to-any\nAssured
    Rate. The PDB is useful to implement services in a\nDifferentiate Services domain,
    which need an assured rate. The\nassurance is given with a certain well-defined
    probability for\ntraffic using this PDB. However, no delay and no jitter guarantees\nare
    provided.\n\t </p>\n      "
