abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a special form of RTP redundant packatization\n
    \  format for multimedia broadcast and multicast services to combat\n   service
    interruptions caused by losses of large numbers of\n   consecutive media frames.
    \ Along with the payload format, this\n   document also defines the procedures
    the RTP sender and receiver will\n   need to use to conceal the large frames losses.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
