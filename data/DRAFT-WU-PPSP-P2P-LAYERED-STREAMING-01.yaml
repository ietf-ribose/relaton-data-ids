abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The scenarios where a Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) contains\nheterogeneous
    nodes need special considerations. For example, mobile\ndevices, PCs and set-top
    boxes may all need to access and provide\nservice for the same content. To support
    heterogeneity and maximize\nthe total network utilization, it may be necessary
    to have layered\ncoding of content to achieve desired results. This document defines\nthe
    Layered P2P Streaming in PPSP with support for heterogeneous peer\nnodes.\n\t
