abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n
    \  traverses a path in the network.  This document discusses the data\n   fields
    and associated data types for in-situ OAM.  In-situ OAM data\n   fields can be
    encapsulated into a variety of protocols such as NSH,\n   Segment Routing, Geneve,
    or IPv6.  In-situ OAM can be used to\n   complement OAM mechanisms based on, e.g.,
    ICMP or other types of\n   probe packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
