abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of
    Things(IoT). Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made itpossible
    to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Sucha network can be
    used for diverse applications such as monitoring humanbody activities and personal
    entertainments. A typical wearable deviceruns on battery power, which is limited
    and often non-rechargeable.Therefore, a low energy operation environment is desirable.
    Emergencytraffic management is an important aspect of such a network. Thisdocument
    describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based onon-demand mechanism can
    work to successfully transmit emergency trafficin a typical body-centric wearable
    network (BC-WN).</p>"
