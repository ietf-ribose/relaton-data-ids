abstract:
- content: "<p>Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of Things
    (IoT). Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made it possible
    to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Such a network can
    be used for diverse applications such as monitoring human body activities and
    personal entertainments. A typical wearable device runs on battery power, which
    is limited and often non-rechargeable. Therefore, a low energy operation environment
    is desirable. Emergency traffic management is an important aspect of such a network.
    This document describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based on on-demand
    mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency traffic in a typical body-centric
    wearable network (BC-WN).</p>"
