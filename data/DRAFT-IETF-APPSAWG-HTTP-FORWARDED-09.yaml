abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an HTTP extension header field that allows\n
    \  proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying\n   process,
    for example, the originating IP address of a request or IP\n   address of the
    proxy on the user-agent-facing interface.  In a path\n   of proxying components,
    this makes it possible to arrange it so that\n   each subsequent component will
    have access to, for example, all IP\n   addresses used in the chain of proxied
    HTTP requests.\n\n   This document also specifies guidelines for a proxy administrator
    to\n   anonymize the origin of a request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
