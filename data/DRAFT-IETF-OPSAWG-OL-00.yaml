abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides for an extension to RFC 8520 that allows
    MUD file\n   authors to specify ownership and licensing of MUD files themselves.\n
    \  This memo updates RFC 8520.  However, it can also be used for\n   purposes
    outside of MUD, and the grouping is structured as such.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
