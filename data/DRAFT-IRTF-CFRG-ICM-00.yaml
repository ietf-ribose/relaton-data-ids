abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Integer Counter Mode (ICM), a mode of\noperation
    of a block cipher which defines an indexed keystream\ngenerator (which generates
    a keystream segment given an index).\nThis mode is efficient, parallelizable,
    and has been proven secure\ngiven realistic assumptions about the block cipher.
    \ Test vectors\nare provided for AES.\nCounter Mode admits many variations.  The
    variant specified in\nthis document is secure and flexible, yet it enables a single\nimplementation
    of a keystream generator to suffice in different\napplication domains.\n\t </p>\n
