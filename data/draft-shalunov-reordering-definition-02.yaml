abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Various pieces of network testing equipment currently often report
    acharacteristic that is referred to as a 'degree (or percentage) ofpacket reordering'.
    The way this metric is computed is oftenundocumented and it differs between vendors.
    Having a useful numericmeasure of the degree of packet reordering is important
    forapplications such as TCP and VoIP on different ends of the spectrum.However,
    the metric that makes sense for one application may have noor little applicability
    to another. This document introduces adefinition of reordering metric that is
    hoped to be applicable to anumber of different applications by parametrizing the
    metric.</p>"
