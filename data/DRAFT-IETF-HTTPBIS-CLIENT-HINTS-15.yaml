abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to
    select the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user agent's
    characteristics, as expressed in request headers. In practice, user agents are
    often unwilling to send those request headers, because it is not clear whether
    they will be used, and sending them impacts both performance and privacy.\n\n
    This document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can use to advertise
    their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation, along with a set
    of guidelines for the creation of such headers, colloquially known as \"Client
    Hints.\"\n\t </p>\n      "
