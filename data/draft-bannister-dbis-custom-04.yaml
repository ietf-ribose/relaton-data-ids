abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support custom databases. The custom database
    schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information Service [NIS]
    but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. A custom database contains arbitrary key/value
    pairs. This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis- mapping-00]
    for custom databases, and database entries referenced by those maps.</p>"
