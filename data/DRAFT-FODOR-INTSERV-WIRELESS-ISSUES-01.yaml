  content: "\n\t <p>We consider a scenario wherein a QoS enabled application uses
    an\nIntegrated Services based API (IntServ).  Where the network\ninterface is
    over a cellular wireless access network, we examine the\nfeasibility of the radio
    management function to establish\nappropriate spectrum efficient bearers to support
    the requested\nservice.\n\t </p>\n      "
