abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mobility Management
    (HMM) in\n       Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks. The Internet
    is\n       divided into a number of mapping domains (MDs). An Agent Tunnel\n       Router
    (ATR) as an agent of each MD manages the Mobile Node's EID-to-\n       RLOC mapping.
    For the movement within the MD, the ATR keeps the EID-\n       to-RLOC mapping
    invariable, so it avoids the mapping update in the\n       mapping system and
    the Tunnel Router (TR) of each correspondent node.\n       For the handover between
    different MDs, to support fast update and\n       handover, a united mapping table
    is proposed in the ATR.\n\n    \n\t </p>\n      "
