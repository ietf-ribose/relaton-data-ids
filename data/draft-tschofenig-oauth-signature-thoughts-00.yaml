abstract:
  content: "<p>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth1.0),
    often referred to as the community addition, included anmechanism for putting
    a digital signature (when using asymmetrickeys) or a keyed message digest (when
    using symmetric keys) to aresource request when presenting the OAuth token. This
    cryptographicmechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly about theproblems
    implementers had, the use cases it supports, and thebenefit-cost tradeoff.This
    document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuthSignature' mechamism
    in an unbiased and less emotional way with themain purpose to conclude the discussions.</p>"
