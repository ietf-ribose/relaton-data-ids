abstract:
- content: "<p>The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level encryption
    of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security standpoint as it might be
    because of its opportunistic nature; message delivery is, by default, prioritized
    over security. This document describes an SMTP service extension, REQUIRETLS,
    and a message header field, TLS-Required. If the REQUIRETLS option or TLS-Required
    message header field is used when sending a message, it asserts a request on the
    part of the message sender to override the default negotiation of TLS, either
    by requiring that TLS be negotiated when the message is relayed or by requesting
    that recipient-side policy mechanisms such as MTA-STS and DNS-Based Authentication
    of Named Entities (DANE) be ignored when relaying a message for which security
    is unimportant.</p>"
