abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7908 provides a definition of the route leak problem, and also
    enumerates several types of route leaks. This document first examines which of
    those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the existing origin validation
    (OV) [RFC 6811]. It is recognized that OV offers a limited detection and mitigation
    capability against route leaks. This document specifies enhancements that significantly
    extend the route-leak prevention, detection, and mitigation capabilities of BGP.
    One solution component involves intra-AS messaging from ingress router to egress
    router using a BGP Community or Attribute. This intra-AS messaging prevents the
    AS from causing route leaks. Another solution component involves carrying a per-hop
    route-leak protection (RLP) field in BGP updates. The RLP fields are proposed
    to be carried in a new optional transitive attribute, called BGP RLP attribute.
    The RLP attribute helps with detection and mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream
    from the leaking AS.</p>"
