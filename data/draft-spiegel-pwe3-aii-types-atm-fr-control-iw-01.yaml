abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes work in progress in the MFA Forum on ATM
    andFrame Relay to MPLS Control Plane Interworking. Two specificationsare being
    defined, one for client-server interworking (between twoclient network endpoints
    that communicate across an IP/MPLS network)and one for SPVC interworking (from
    a client network endpoint to anIP/MPLS network endpoint). Both client-server interworking
    and SPVCInterworking use standard PWE3 control for establishment of thepseudowires
    that transport the ATM or Frame Relay data connectionsacross the IP/MPLS network.
    New AII type codepoints from the \"ExpertReview\" range are requested. The need
    for these codepoints andproposed usage is described.</p>"
