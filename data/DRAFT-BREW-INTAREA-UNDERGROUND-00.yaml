abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When users are at known undergroudn locations, such as tube stations\nthey
    often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the\nsatellites required
    cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests\nproviding GPS locations over
    WiFI using remote IP detection for a\nserver to respond with the correct name
    of clients location and\nthe clients GPS location.\n\nExtending this to those
    without WifI access the standard goes one\nstage further, by offering a hidden
    wifi network with a standard name,\nsuch as .location. The principle being that
    mobile devices can\nlook for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected.
    It\nis hoped that this will allow those using mapping services to know\nwhere
    they are when travelling on underground trains etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
