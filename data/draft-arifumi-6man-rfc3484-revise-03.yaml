abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 3484 has several known issues to be fixed. Deprecation of IPv6site-local
    unicast address and the coming of ULA brought somepreferable changes to the rules.
    Additionally, the rule 9 of thedestination address selection rules, namely the
    longest matchingrule, is known for its adverse effect on the round robin DNStechnique.
    This document covers these points to be fixed andproposes possible useful changes
    to be included in the revision ofRFC 3484.</p>"
