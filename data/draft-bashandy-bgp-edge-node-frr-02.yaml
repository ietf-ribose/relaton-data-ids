abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,CE2,...,
    CEm. If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totallydisconnected from the core,
    it is desirable for a core router \"P\"carrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restoretraffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi anddestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers thatadvertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it ishighly desirable to keep
    the core BGP-free while not imposingrestrictions on external connectivity. Thus
    (1) a core router shouldnot be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the size
    of theforwarding and routing tables in the core routers should beindependent of
    the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should be nospecial router (or group of routers)
    that handles restoring trafficor the need for one router to store the forwarding
    table of anotherrouter, (4) re-routing traffic without waiting for re-convergencemust
    not cause loops, and (4) there should be no restrictions on whatedge routers advertise
    what prefixes. For labeled prefixes, (6) therepairing core router must swap the
    label stack advertised by thefailed edge router PEi for the prefix P/m with the
    label stackadvertised for the same prefix by the edge router PEj before re-tunneling
    the packet to PEj</p>"
