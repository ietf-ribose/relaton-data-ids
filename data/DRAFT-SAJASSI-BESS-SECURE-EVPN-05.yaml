abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The applications of EVPN-based solutions ([RFC7432] and [RFC8365])\n
    \  have become pervasive in Data Center, Service Provider, and\n   Enterprise
    segments.  It is being used for fabric overlays and inter-\n   site connectivity
    in the Data Center market segment, for Layer-2,\n   Layer-3, and IRB VPN services
    in the Service Provider market segment,\n   and for fabric overlay and WAN connectivity
    in Enterprise networks.\n   For Data Center and Enterprise applications, there
    is a need to\n   provide inter-site and WAN connectivity over public Internet
    in a\n   secured manner with same level of privacy, integrity, and\n   authentication
    for tenant's traffic as IPsec tunneling using IKEv2.\n   This document presents
    a solution where BGP point-to-multipoint\n   signaling is leveraged for key and
    policy exchange among PE devices\n   to create private pair-wise IPsec Security
    Associations without IKEv2\n   point-to-point signaling or any other direct peer-to-peer
    session\n   establishment messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
