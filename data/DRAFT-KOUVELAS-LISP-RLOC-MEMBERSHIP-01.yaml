abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) operation is based
    on EID\n   to RLOC mappings that are exchanged through a mapping system.  The\n
    \  mapping system can use the RLOCs included in mapping registrations to\n   construct
    the complete set of RLOC addresses across all xTRs that are\n   members of the
    LISP deployment.  This set can then be made available\n   by the mapping system
    to all the member xTRs.  An xTR can use the\n   RLOC set to optimise protocol
    operation as well as to implement new\n   functionality.  This document describes
    the use of the LISP reliable\n   transport session between an xTR and a Map-Server
    to communicate the\n   contents of the RLOC membership set.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
