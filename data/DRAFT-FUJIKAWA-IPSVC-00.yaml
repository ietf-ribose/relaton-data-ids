abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes IP-SVC that is another ATM signaling protocol
    for implementing IP protocols. IP-SVC restricts the range of signaling to an IP
    subnet, and this restriction makes the IP-SVC structure simple.  IP-SVC provides
    easy implementation of the mechanism of ARP and IP multicasting without any servers.
    \                                                      IP-SVC can not establish
    VCs across IP subnet boundaries by itself.  However, adapting CSRs (Cell Switching
    Routers) with RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) enables end-to-end VC establishment
    across IP subnet boundaries in IP/ATM LANs based on IP-SVC.  This method also
    shows one solution of RSVP over ATM.\n\t </p>\n      "
