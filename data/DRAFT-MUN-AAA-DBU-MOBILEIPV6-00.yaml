    the messages with it's Corresponeant Node(CN) by using \nthe secure communication
    platform, the AAA infrastructure that consists \nof the many AAA servers in different
    domains when the MN is about to \nenter the visited link.\nThe MIPv6 node (MN,
    CN or both) has the unique identifier, NAI\n(Network Access Identifier) to distinguish
    itself from others and by\nparsing the NAI[5], we can get the information on which
    domain the MN \nbelongs.\n\t </p>\n      "
