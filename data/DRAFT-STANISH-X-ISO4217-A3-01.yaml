abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of\n
    \  identifiers for currencies or currency-like commodities lying outside\n   the
    traditional scope of the International Organization for\n   Standardization (ISO)
    4217 alpha-3 standard, such as digital\n   currencies and commodities, currencies
    issued by countries (nation-\n   states) with limited international recognition,
    emerging commodities\n   such as emissions reduction credits, private or commercial\n
    \  currencies, and accounting units for local exchange and trading\n   systems
    (LETS).  Such codes are already in use; the registry simply\n   codifies their
    existence.  This document obsoletes draft-stanish-x-\n   iso4217-a3-00.\n\t </p>\n
