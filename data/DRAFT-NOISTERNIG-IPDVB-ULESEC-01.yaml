abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol is
    an \nefficient and extensible transport mechanism for IP over MPEG-2 \nnetworks.
    Such networks are often operated on broadcast wireless \n \n \n channels, and
    are thus specifically vulnerable to attacks. Passive \nattacks, such as eaves-dropping,
    are simple to perform and emphasize \nthe importance of security support within
    ULE. \n\nThis document defines a mandatory security extension for the ULE \nprotocol
    that is designed with the aim of being conservative in \nbandwidth consumption
    and lightweight in the sense that it allows for \nimplementation in low-cost,
    resource-scarce (mobile) receiver \ndevices. The extension may be easily adapted
    to the Generic Stream \nEncapsulation (GSE) protocol, which uses the same extension
    header \nmechanism. The document describes the format of the security \nextension
    header, specifies default security algorithms to be used \nwith this extension,
    and gives detailed processing descriptions for \ndevices implementing the security
    extension. \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe following DVB specific
    terms are taken from [RFC4326] and \nrecapitulated here for easy lookup: \n\nDVB:
    Digital Video Broadcast.  A framework and set of associated \nstandards published
    by the European Telecommunications Standards \nInstitute (ETSI) for the transmission
    of video, audio, and data using \nthe ISO MPEG-2 standard [MPEG2]. \n\nMPEG-2:
    A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts \nGroup (MPEG) and
    standardized by the International Standards \nOrganization (ISO/IEC 13818-1) [MPEG2]
    and ITU-T [H222]. \n\nNPA: Network Point of Attachment.  In this document, refers
    to a 48-\nbit destination address (resembling an IEEE MAC address) within the
    \nMPEG-2 transmission network that is used to identify individual \nreceivers
    or groups of receivers. \n\nPDU: Protocol Data Unit.  Examples of a PDU include
    Ethernet frames, \nIPv4 or IPv6 datagrams, and other network packets. \n\nPID:
    Packet Identifier [MPEG2].  A 13-bit field carried in the header \nof TS cells.
    \ This is used to identify the TS Logical Channel to \nwhich a TS cell belongs
    [MPEG2]. \n\nSNDU: SubNetwork Data Unit.  An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2
    \npayload unit. \n\nTS: Transport Stream [MPEG2].  A method of transmission at
    the MPEG-2 \nlevel using TS cells; it represents layer 2 of the ISO/OSI reference
    \nmodel. \n \n TS Logical Channel: Transport Stream Logical Channel.  In this
    \ndocument, this term identifies a channel at the MPEG-2 level [MPEG2]. \nAll
    packets sent over a TS Logical Channel carry the same PID value. \n\nULE: Unidirectional
    Lightweight Encapsulation [RFC4326].  A protocol \nthat encapsulates PDUs into
    SNDUs that are sent in a series of TS \ncells using a single TS Logical Channel.
    \n\nTerms and abbreviations from cryptography are explained when they \nfirst
    appear within this document. \n\nAll numbers encoded in protocols are to be interpreted
    in network \nbyte order. \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\", when \nappearing within this document, are to be interpreted
    as described in \n[RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
