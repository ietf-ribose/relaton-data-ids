abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes alternative, optimized packet structures for
    theHost Identity Payload and Host Layer Protocol (HIP). The packetstructures presented
    in this memo are intended replace originalpackets in HIP. In addition, this memo
    describes a new packet, CER,to transmit certificates.The main objective in redefining
    HIP packet structures is to make thepacket structures simpler and more distinct,
    which makes theimplementation work easier, hopefully leading to more secure protocolimplementation.
    The new structures reduce the average packet size andtake advantage of other existing
    IPv6 protocols formats, includingalignments concerns, like the newly suggested
    Mobility header formatfor Mobile IPv6.</p>"
