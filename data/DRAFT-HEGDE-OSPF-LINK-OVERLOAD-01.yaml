abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 deployments run on overlay networks provisioned\n
    \  by means of pseudo-wires or L2-circuits.  when the devices in the\n   underlying
    network go for maintenance, it is useful to divert the\n   traffic away from the
    node before the maintenance is actually\n   scheduled.  Since the nodes in the
    underlying network are not visible\n   to OSPF, existing stub router mechanism
    described in [RFC3137] cannot\n   be used.  It is useful for routers in OSPFv2
    or OSPFv3 routing domain\n   to be able to advertise a link being in overload
    state to indicate\n   impending maintenance activity in the underlying network
    devices.\n\n   This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate
    link\n   overload information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
