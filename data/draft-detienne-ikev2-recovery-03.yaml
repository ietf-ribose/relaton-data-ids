abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) suffers from the
    limitation of not having a means to quickly recover from a stale state known as
    dangling Security Associations (SA's) where one side has SA's that the corresponding
    party does not have anymore. This Draft proposes to address the limitation by
    offering an immediate, DoS-free recovery mechanism for IKE that can be used in
    all failover or post-crash situations.</p>"
