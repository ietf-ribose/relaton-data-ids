abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a
    full\nsend, receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique message\nfeatures,
    semantics and usage patterns. Voice messaging was\nintroduced on special purpose
    computers that interface to a telephone\nswitch and provide call answering and
    voice messaging services.\nTraditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging
    system to\nanother were transported using analog networking protocols based on\nDTMF
    signaling and analog voice playback.  As the demand for\nnetworking increases,
    there was a need for a standard high-quality\ndigital protocol to connect these
    machines.  VPIM has successfully\ndemonstrated its usefulness as this new standard.
    \ VPIM is widely\nimplemented and is seeing deployment in early adopter customer\nnetworks.
    This document clarifies ambiguities found in the earlier\nspecification and is
    consistent with implementation practice. The\nprofile is referred to as VPIM (Voice
    Profile for Internet Mail) in\nthis document.\nThis second revision of the version
    2 of obsoletes RFC 2421 which\nless precisely describes version 2 of the profile.\n\t
