abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless
    network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other
    standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the
    wireless medium. This document defines an architecture element for the RAW data
    plane, in the form of an OODA loop, that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum
    and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties. The loop involves
    OAM, PCE, and PREOF extensions, and a new component called the Path Selection
    Engine (PSE).</p>"
