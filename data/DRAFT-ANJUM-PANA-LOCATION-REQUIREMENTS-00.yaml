    an IP \nnetwork using cryptographic credentials. This document identifies\nscenarios
    where there may be a need for a client to provide location  \ncredentials, in
    addition to cryptographic credentials, to gain     \nnetwork access. This document
    also enumerates the requirements for \nPANA support of location based services.\n\n\t
