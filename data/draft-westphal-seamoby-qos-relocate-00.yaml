abstract:
  content: "<p>Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node duringhandovers
    is considered crucial for enabling a variety of applicationservices in the Mobile
    Internet. In this document, we define the QoScontexts and show how they could
    be transferred to enable seamless QoSoperation during handovers. We introduce
    the notion of QoS ProfileTypes and the associated QoS Profiles, which together
    constitute QoScontexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability among the pariticipatingaccess
    routers. We also illustrate how these contexts can be used withfast handover signaling.</p>"
