abstract:
- content: "<p>One aspect of the transition to post-quantum algorithms in cryptographic
    protocols is the development of hybrid schemes that incorporate both post-quantum
    and traditional asymmetric algorithms. This document defines terminology for such
    schemes. It is intended to ensure consistency and clarity across different protocols,
    standards, and organisations.</p>"
