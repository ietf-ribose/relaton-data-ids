abstract:
- content: "<p>With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access network
    for service providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available
    in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access networks. Such functions include Access Point
    Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless
    mobility between WiFi and 3G/4G networks. EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized
    by 3GPP as the access authentication protocol for trusted access networks. This
    IETF specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP Evolved Packet
    Core (EPC) networks. This document defines a few new EAP attributes and procedures
    to provide the above-mentioned functions in trusted WiFi access networks.</p>"
