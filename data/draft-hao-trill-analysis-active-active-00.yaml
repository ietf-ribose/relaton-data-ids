abstract:
- content: "<p>Draft [TRILL-Active-PS] lists basic problems which any active-active
    solutions should address, these problems include frame duplications, loop, MAC
    address flip-flop and unsynchronized information among member RBridges. For each
    problem, there may be multiple ways to deal with it. And some solutions solves
    all or most of the problems listed, and at the same time introduces extra issues.
    This draft tries to analyze and compare the different solutions for each of the
    issue, gives a brief summary on the pros and cons, and/or the applicable scenarios.</p>"
