abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes a means to add awareness of de- duplication
    storage to NFS in order to save resources on NFS client and to reduce bandwidth
    for servicing READ and WRITE operations. The means presented leads to a second
    benefit of providing sub-file, block-granular caching.</p>"
