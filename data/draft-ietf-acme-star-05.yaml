abstract:
- content: "<p>Public-key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised,
    that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an unauthorized entity.
    However the revocation process is often unreliable. An alternative to revocation
    is issuing a sequence of certificates, each with a short validity period, and
    terminating this sequence upon compromise. This memo proposes an ACME extension
    to enable the issuance of short-term and automatically renewed (STAR) X.509 certificates.
