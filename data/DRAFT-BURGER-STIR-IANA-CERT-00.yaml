abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an IANA registry that maps country codes
    to\n   secure telephone identity (STIR) root certificates authorized to\n   create
    signing certificates for telephone numbers under the authority\n   of a given
    country.  Some countries allow carriers to block\n   unsolicited, automatically
    generated nuisance calls commonly known as\n   'robocalls.'  The use of signed
    STIR tokens in the Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) may be useful in such
    scenarios to provide positive\n   attestations as to call origin.  Legacy telephone
    numbering resources\n   are administrated by national policy.  Unlike the market-driven
    use\n   case of Web commerce, some nations may restrict the list of STIR root\n
    \  certificate authorities acceptable for issuing signing certificates\n   for
    STIR tokens that provide attestations for their local legacy\n   telephone numbering
    resources.  The registry described in this\n   document enables call recipients
    in a first country to validate that\n   signaling it receives from a caller with
    a telephone number claiming\n   to be in a second country conforms to the second
    country's policy of\n   (1) having a limited list of STIR root certificate authorities
    (or\n   not) and (2) the certificate that produced the signature over the\n   signaling
    is signed by one of those authorized STIR root certificate\n   authorities.\n\n\t
