abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol is specified in RFC8484. This document
    considers Centralized DoH deployment, which seems one likely way that DoH may
    be implemented, based on recent industry discussions and testing. This describes
    that implementation model, as well the potential associated risks and issues.
    The document also makes recommendations pertaining to the implementation of DoH,
    as well as recommendations for further study prior to widespread adoption.</p>"
