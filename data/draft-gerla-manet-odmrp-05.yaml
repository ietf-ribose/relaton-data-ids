abstract:
- content: "<p>The On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing
    protocol designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is a mesh-based,
    rather than a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a forwarding
    group concept (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped
    flooding). It applies on-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain
    multicast group membership, without relying on pre-existing unicast routing protocols.
    ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc wireless networks with mobile hosts where bandwidth
    is limited, topology changes frequently and rapidly, and power is constrained.</p>"
