abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Real-time Transport Protocol is a flexible protocol possible
    to use\n   in a wide range of applications and network and system topologies.\n
    \  This flexibility and the implications of different choices should be\n   understood
    by any application developer using RTP.  To facilitate\n   that understanding,
    this document contains an in-depth discussion of\n   the usage of RTP's multiplexing
    points; the RTP session, the\n   Synchronization Source Identifier (SSRC), and
    the payload type.  The\n   focus is put on the first two, trying to give guidance
    and source\n   material for an analysis on the most suitable choices for the\n
    \  application being designed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
