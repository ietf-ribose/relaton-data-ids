abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes an extension to LDP signaling that enables
    the PW\nownership transfer between the Management Plane and the Control\nPlane.
    \ This document defines all PW transfer related procedures.\nThis includes the
    handling of failure conditions and subsequent\nreversion to original state.  A
    basic premise of the extension is\nthat the transfer procedures must never impact
    an already established\nData plane connection.\n\t </p>\n      "
