abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against\n
    \  requests from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange\n   (with
    no response path from the server to the client) may be desired\n   to minimize
    resource consumption in constrained systems while\n   updating a bulk of resources
    simultaneously, or updating a resource\n   with a very high frequency. CoAP already
    provides Non-confirmable\n   (NON) messages that are not acknowledged by the recipient.
    However,\n   the request/response semantics still require the server to respond\n
    \  with a status code indicating \"the result of the attempt to\n   understand
    and satisfy the request\".\n\n   This specification introduces a CoAP option called
    'No-Response'.\n   Using this option the client can explicitly tell the server
    to\n   suppress all responses against the particular request. This option\n   also
    provides granular control to enable suppression of a particular\n   class of response
    or a combination of response-classes. This option\n   may be effective for both
    unicast and multicast requests. This\n   document also discusses a few exemplary
    applications which benefit\n   from this option.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
