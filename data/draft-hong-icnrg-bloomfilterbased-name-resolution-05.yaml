abstract:
- content: "<p>In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable and
    location independent names are assigned directly to the named data which raises
    scalability issues and they get even worse with flat names. Accordingly, name
    resolution system required for lookup-by- name routing in ICN has to be designed
    to scale, also considering mobility support. In this draft, a bloom filter-based
    flat name resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the bloom filter as an aggregated
    form of names and hierarchical structure of the B-NRS are exploited to address
    the scalability issues.</p>"
