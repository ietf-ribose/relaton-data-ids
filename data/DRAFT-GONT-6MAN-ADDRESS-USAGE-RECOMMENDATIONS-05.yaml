    of IPv6\n   addresses based on a number of properties (such as address scope,\n
    \  stability, and usage type), and identifies gaps that currently\n   prevent
    systems and applications from leveraging the increased\n   flexibility and availability
    of IPv6 addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
