abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables a router
    to signal to its neighbor the metric that the neighbor should use towards itself
    using link-local advertisement between them. The signalling of this reverse metric,
    to be used on link(s) towards itself, allows a router to influence the amount
    of traffic flowing towards itself and in certain use-cases enables routers to
    maintain symmetric metric on both sides of a link between them.</p>"
