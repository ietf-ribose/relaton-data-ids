abstract:
- content: <p>The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes
    a Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based multimedia
    sessions established with the Offer/Answer model. The ICE extension for Incremental
    Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism that allows ICE Agents
    to shorten session establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and
    connectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel.
    This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP). The document also defines a new SIP Info Package to support this
    usage together with the corresponding media type. Additionally, a new Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) "end-of-candidates" attribute and a new SIP option
    tag "trickle-ice" are defined.</p>
