abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element\nwhich
    also has access to one or more virtual private networks (VPNs).\nIf a DHCP server
    wishes to offer service to DHCP clients on those\ndifferent VPNs the DHCP server
    needs to know information about the\nVPN on which each client resides. The Virtual
    Subnet Selection sub-\noption of the relay-agent-information option is used by
    the relay\nagent to tell the DHCP server important information about the VPN\n(called
    the Virtual Subnet Selection information, or VSS) for every\nDHCP request it passes
    on to the DHCP server, and is also used to\nproperly forward any DHCP reply that
    the DHCP server sends back to\nthe relay agent.\n\t </p>\n      "
