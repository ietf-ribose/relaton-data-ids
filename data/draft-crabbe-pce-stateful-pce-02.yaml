abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. Although PCEP explicitly
    makes no assumptions regarding the information available to the PCE, it also makes
    no provisions for synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence of path
    computations within and across PCEP sessions. This document describes a set of
    extensions to PCEP to enable this functionality, providing stateful control of
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths
    (TE LSP) via PCEP.</p>"
