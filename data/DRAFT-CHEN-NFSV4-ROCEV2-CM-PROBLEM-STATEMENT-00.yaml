abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2\n
    \  protocol. RoCEv2 specification does not define the congestion\n   management
    and load balancing methods. RoCEv2 relies on the existing\n   Link-Layer Flow-Control
    IEEE 802.1Qbb(Priority-based Flow Control,\n   PFC)to provide a lossless network.
    RoCEv2 Congestion Management(RCM)\n   use ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification,
    defined in RFC3168) to\n   signal the congestion to the destination and use the
    congestion\n   notification to reduce the rate of injection and increase the\n
    \  injection rate when the extent of congestion decreases. More and more\n   practice
    of congestion management for RoCEv2 appear in the industry,\n   such as DCQCN(Data
    Center Quantized Congestion Notification). There\n   is a demanding for the new
    RoCE protocol(temporary alias RoCEv3) to\n   provide stronger congestion management
    and load balancing mechanisms\n   for RDMA deployment in modern datacenter.\n\n\t
