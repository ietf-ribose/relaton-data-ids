abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round trip times
    to the closest DNS root server. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to
    prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root servers by third parties. Such resolvers
    can greatly decrease the round trip time and prevent observation of requests by
    running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such as 127.0.0.1).
    This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that
    does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational
    fragility for the operator.</p>"
