abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DIAP has been created to solve mid-range and below, long term\narchiving
    requirements of the small medium enterprise.  Where tape\nhas been deployed in
    the past, DIAP now offers an alternative\nsolution designed to be more robust
    and manageable in the long term\nthan network attached storage devices or simple
    disk storage alone.\nThe system provides a well defined structure for storing
    and managing\nlong term archives.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft
    is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP
    79.\n\nInternet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering\nTask
