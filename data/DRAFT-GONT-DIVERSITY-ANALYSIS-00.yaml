abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses a number of structural issues that
    currently\n   hinders diversity and inclusiveness in the IETF.  The issues\n   discussed
    in this document are non-exhaustive, but still provide a\n   good starting point
    for the IETF to establish a more comprehensive\n   agenda to foster diversity
    and inclusiveness.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
