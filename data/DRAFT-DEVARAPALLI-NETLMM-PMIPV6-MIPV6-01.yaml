abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based local mobility management\n
    \  protocol developed in the IETF.  Mobile IPv6 is a host-based mobility\n   management
    protocol that has no restrictions in terms of\n   applicability in a domain.  This
    document captures some of the\n   scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile
    IPv6 are used together.\n   It also describes how the two protocols can work together.\n\n\t
