abstract:
- content: <p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
    Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled to
    a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term "localized routing" refers
    to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG
    of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA. In order to establish
    a localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domain, the usage of localized routing may be authorized for both MAGs. This
    document specifies how to accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.</p>
