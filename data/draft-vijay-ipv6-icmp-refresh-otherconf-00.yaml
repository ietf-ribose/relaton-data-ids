abstract:
  content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] provides a way by which thenodes
    can determine whether to use administered protocol for addressautoconfiguration
    and other non-address information through M and Obits in the Router Advertisements.
    Though RAs can notify nodes of achange in the address prefixes, currently there
    is no way the nodescan learn that there is a change in the non-address configurationparameters.
    This will make the nodes unable to learn about new orchanged configuration parameters
    like DNS server addresses. Thisspecification extends the Neighbor Discovery protocol
    [RFC2461] tonotify the nodes that the other information obtained through anadministered
    protocol has been changed.</p>"
