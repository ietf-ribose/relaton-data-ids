abstract:
  content: "<p>This informational draft presents a simulation study to compare theperformance
    of two and three drop precedence levels in an AssuredForwarding traffic class
    for mixed TCP/UDP traffic. This is a revisedand comprehensive version of our previous
    study presented at theMarch 99 IETF Meeting at Minneapolis. For this study, we
    consultedthe principal authors of the Assured Forwarding Class to determinethe
    parameter set and configurations under which it would bebeneficial to have 3-drop
    preferences. The results presented here arebased on 1296 simulations (different
    parameter/traffic patterncombinations). The results of the simulation study suggest
    thatoptimal number of drop precedence levels in a traffic class dependson the
    traffic load and amount of reserved traffic. In a mixed TCP-UDP traffic scenario,
    best performance can be achieved with either 2or 3 levels of drop precedence if
    most of the TCP packets have'better' drop precedence than excess UDP packets.</p>"
