abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPsec is of increasing importance within data centers to secure\n
    \  tunnels used to carry multi-tenant traffic encapsulated using the\n   Network
    Virtualization over L3 (NVO3) protocols. Encrypting NVO3\n   tunnels provides
    defense against bad actors within the physical\n   underlay network from monitoring
    or injecting overlay traffic from\n   outside the NVO3 infrastructure. When securing
    data center tunnels\n   using IPsec it becomes crucial to retain entropy within
    the outer\n   IPsec packet headers to facilitate load balancing over the highly\n
    \  meshed networks used in these environments. While entropy is\n   necessary
    to support load distribution algorithms it is also\n   important that the entropy
    codes used retain integrity of flows to\n   prevent performance deterioration
    resulting from packet re-ordering.\n   Here, we describe a use case for load balancing
    IPsec traffic within\n   multi-tenant data centers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
