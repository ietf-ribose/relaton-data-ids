abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new, backwards-compatible, approach
    to\n   packet forwarding, where the service required rather than the IP\n   address
    required acts as the vector for routing packets at the edge\n   of the network.
    \ Deeper in the network, the mechanism can interface\n   to conventional and future
    methods of service or application aware\n   networking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
