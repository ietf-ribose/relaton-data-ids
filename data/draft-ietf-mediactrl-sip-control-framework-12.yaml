abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework and protocol for application deployment
    where the application programming logic and media processing are distributed.
    This implies that application programming logic can seamlessly gain access to
    appropriate resources that are not co-located on the same physical network entity.
    The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level
    control mechanism between application servers and associated external servers
    such as media servers. The motivation for the creation of this framework is to
    provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a centralized conference
    system, where the conference system can be distributed, as defined by the XCON
    working group in the IETF. It is not, however, limited to this scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
