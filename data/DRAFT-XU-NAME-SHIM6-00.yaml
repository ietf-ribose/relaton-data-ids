abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution
    for\nname-based sockets.  Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses,\nshim6
    can handle a more diverse set of mobility scenarios.  These\nchanges allow a shim6
    session to persist even through cases where one\nnode has no working locators
    to its correspondent node.  If the name\nis also a resolvable fully qualified
    domain name, the connection can\nbe kept alive even if neither node have a working
    locator to the\ncorresponding node.  As can be the case if both nodes are mobile\nsimultaneously.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
