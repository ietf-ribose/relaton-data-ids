abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the\n   Endpoint
    Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost\n   Metric.\n\n   Different
    applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For\n   example, a Resource
    Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have\n   low delay to the Resource
    Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol\n   [ALTO] has defined only a single
    cost metric, i.e., the generic\n   \"routingcost\" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base
    specification [ALTO]).\n\n   In this document, we define eleven Cost Metrics,
    derived from OSPF-TE\n   and ISIS-TE, to measure network delay, jitter, packet
    loss, hop\n   count, and bandwidth.  The metrics defined in this document provide
    a\n   relatively comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO focusing on\n   traffic
    engineering (TE).  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial\n   cost metrics
    may be defined in other documents.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
