abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs
    on top\n   of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience, and implements\n
    \  mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport\n   protocol.
    \ Using UDP as the basis of QUIC is intended to address\n   compatibility issues
    with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC\n   authenticates all of its headers,
    preventing third parties from\n   changing them.  QUIC encrypts most of its headers,
    thereby limiting\n   protocol evolution to QUIC endpoints only.  Therefore, middleboxes,\n
    \  in large part, are not required to be updated as new protocol\n   versions
    are deployed.  This document describes the core QUIC\n   protocol, including the
    conceptual design, wire format, and\n   mechanisms of the QUIC protocol for connection
    establishment, stream\n   multiplexing, stream and connection-level flow control,
    and data\n   reliability.  Accompanying documents describe QUIC's loss recovery\n
    \  and congestion control, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation.\n\n\t </p>\n
