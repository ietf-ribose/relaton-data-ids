abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the investigation of 4via6 in the scenario where
    IPv6 prefix delegation is deployed. A practicable application scenarios with IPv6
    prefix delegation have been introduced in the mobile network environments. The
    applicability of 4via6 mechnism has been analyzed in term of mapping rules and
    4via6 address structure. Targeting to alignment with existing 4via6 mapping algorithm
    and RFC6052 recommendation, an alternative 4via6 address structure have been proposed
    to be capable of assigning flexible address/port set to 4via6 domains.</p>"
