abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new type of traffic filtering action
    for the\n   BGP flow specification.  The new packet-rate action allows specifying\n
    \  a rate-limit in number of packets per second.  This is intended to be\n   used
    in combatting some types of denial of service attacks where the\n   packet rate
    is more important than the raw bitrate of the attack\n   traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n
