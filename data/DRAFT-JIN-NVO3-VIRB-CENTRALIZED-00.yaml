abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network,\n
    \  which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or\n   L3
    routing capability.  A combined L2&amp;L3 solution could provide great\n   scalability
    for both Layer2 and Layer3 switching.  In this document,\n   we propose to apply
    centralized server to be the control plane of the\n   combined L2&amp;L3 solution,
    to provide better scalability for the\n   control plane.  The combined L2&amp;L3
    solution in this draft is named\n   Virtualized Integrated Routing&amp;Bridging
    (shorted as VIRB).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
