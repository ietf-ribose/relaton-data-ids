abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for Delay-Tolerant Networking\n
    \  (DTN) multicast that is compatible with Compressed Bundle Header\n   Encoding
    (CBHE).  The mechanism, named \"Interplanetary Multicast\"\n   (IMC), comprises
    (a) a single network-wide multicast spanning tree\n   overlaid on any single Bundle
    Protocol (BP)-based network, (b)\n   multicast groups that take the form of ordinary
    BP non-singleton\n   endpoints, (c) a new CBHE-compatible URI scheme, \"imc\",
    for\n   expressing the identities of these endpoints, (d) a new type of BP\n   administrative
    record that propagates multicast \"petitions\"\n   (announcements regarding nodes'
    membership in IMC endpoints) through\n   the multicast tree, and (e) a new bundle
    forwarding procedure by\n   which bundles whose destinations are multicast groups
    are forwarded\n   through the multicast tree in accord with previously received\n
    \  petitions.\n\n   IMC is designed to provide simple and efficient multi-source,\n
    \  generally reliable, delay-tolerant multi-point data delivery in a\n   network
    of arbitrary size.  Anycast, content-centric networking,\n   persistent messages,
    and similar research challenges are not\n   explicitly supported.\n\n   For research
    purposes and small-scale deployment, it is anticipated\n   that multicast tree
    construction and maintenance can be manual.  For\n   larger networks an automated
    protocol for IMC tree management would\n   be required; the design of such a protocol
    is beyond the scope of\n   this specification.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
