abstract:
  content: "<p>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, andan
    IPsec security association with its home agent before it can startutilizing Mobile
    IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all ofthese parameters are statically
    configured. Ongoing work aims tomake this information dynamically available to
    the mobile node. Animportant aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution
    is tosupport interworking with the existing authentication, authorizationand accounting
    infrastructure. This document defines new attributesthat facilitate Mobile IPv6
    bootstrapping via a RADIUSinfrastructure. This information exchange may take place
    as part ofthe initial network access authentication procedure or as part of aseparate
    protocol exchange between the mobile node, the home agentand the AAA infrastructure.</p>"
