abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML)\n
    \  format as a genearlized file format for any type of data in a\n   hierarchical
    form.  EBML is designed as a binary equivalent to XML\n   and utilizes a storage-efficient
    approach to building nested Elements\n   with identifiers, lengths, and values.
    \ Similar to how an XML Schema\n   defines the structure and semantics of an XML
    Document, this document\n   defines an EBML Schema to convey the semantics of
    an EBML Document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
