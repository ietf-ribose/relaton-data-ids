abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports IP dormancyfor
    hosts and Mobile Nodes. The concept specifies a generic modelthat can be applied
    to several mobility mechanisms (including MobileIPv6, Localized Mobility Managament)
    and is independent of thelayer-2 access technology and paging capabilities. The
    model allowsfor optimizations of the benefits of layer-2 paging when present,while
    minimizing the impact on layer-2 paging.</p>"
