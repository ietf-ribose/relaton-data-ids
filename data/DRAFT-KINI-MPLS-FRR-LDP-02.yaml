abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since
    LDP\n   establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is\n   gated
    by IGP's re-convergence. Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE\n   based FRR have
    been used to provide faster re-route for LDP LSPs.\n   However these techniques
    have significant complexity and/or may not\n   have full coverage. In this document
    we describe a method to perform\n   fast re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to
    have recovery\n   characteristics similar to the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without\n
    \  depending on additional protocols but at the same time provide full\n   coverage.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
