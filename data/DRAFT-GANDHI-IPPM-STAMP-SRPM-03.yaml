abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way\n   Active
    Measurement Protocol (STAMP)) extensions for SR networks, for\n   both SR-MPLS
    and SRv6 data planes by augmenting the optional\n   extensions defined in RFC
    8972.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
