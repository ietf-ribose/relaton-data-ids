abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure uses references
    to keys in general. For some algorithms, additional properties are defined which
    carry parts of keys as needed. The COSE Key structure is used for transporting
    keys outside of COSE messages. This document extends the way that keys can be
    identified and transported by providing attributes that refer to or contain X.509
    certificates.</p>"
