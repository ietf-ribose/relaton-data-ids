abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF has two different proposals on the table for how to do
    DNS\nsupport for IPv6, and has thus far failed to reach a clear consensus\non
    which approach is better.  This note attempts to examine the pros\nand cons of
    each approach, in the hope of clarifying the debate so\nthat we can reach closure
    and move on.\n\t </p>\n      "
