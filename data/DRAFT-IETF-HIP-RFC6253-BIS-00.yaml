abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CERT parameter is a container for digital certificates.
    \ It is\n   used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)\n
    \  control packets.  This document specifies the certificate parameter\n   and
    the error signaling in case of a failed verification.\n   Additionally, this document
    specifies the representations of Host\n   Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3)
    and SPKI certificates.\n\n   The concrete use of certificates including how certificates
    are\n   obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or\n
    \  failed verification are specific to the scenario in which the\n   certificates
    are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-\n   specific aspects are left
    to the documents that use the CERT\n   parameter.\n\n   This document updates
    RFC 5201.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
