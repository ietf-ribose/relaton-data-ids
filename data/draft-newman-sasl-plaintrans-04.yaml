abstract:
- content: "<p>Unencrypted plaintext passwords are the biggest single risk to Internet
    application protocol security. Unfortunately, they are widely deployed, often
    tightly integrated into operating system services and very difficult to replace
    in an interoperable fashion. This specification discusses some methods which can
    be used to eliminate unencrypted plaintext passwords. It also defines a SASL mechanism
    [SASL] which may be used by newer protocols such as ACAP [ACAP] to transition
    away from a legacy authentication database.</p>"
