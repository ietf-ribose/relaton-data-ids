abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mutual authentication method for the Hyper-
    text Transport Protocol (HTTP). This method provides a true mutual authentication
    between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using password-based authentication.
    Unlike the Basic and Digest authentication methods, the Mutual authentication
    method specified in this document assures the user that the server truly knows
    the user's encrypted password. This prevents common phishing attacks: a phishing
    attacker controlling a fake website cannot convince a user that he authenticated
    to the genuine website. Furthermore, even when a user authenticates to an illegitimate
    server, the server cannot gain any information about the user's password. The
    Mutual authentication method is designed as an extension to the HTTP protocol,
    and is intended to replace the existing authentication methods used in HTTP (the
    Basic method, Digest method, and authentication using HTML forms).</p>"
