abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The  Point-to-Point  Protocol  (PPP)  [1] provides a standard
    method for\ntransporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n
    \nThe PPP Compression Control Protocol [2] provides a method to  negotiate\nand
    utilize compression protocols over PPP encapsulated links.\n \nThe  Microsoft
    Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP) [3]\nis a Microsoft-proprietary
    PPP authentication  protocol,  providing  the\nfunctionality  to which LAN-based
    users are accustomed while integrating\nthe encryption and hashing algorithms
    used on Windows networks.\n \nMicrosoft Point to Point Encryption (MPPE) [4] is
    a means of  represent-\ning  PPP  packets  in  an  encrypted  form.   MPPE  uses
    the RSA RC4 [5]\nalgorithm to provide data confidentiality.  The length  of  the
    \ session\nkey  to  be  used  for initializing encryption tables can be negotiated.\nMPPE
    currently supports 40-bit and 128-bit session keys.   MPPE  session\nkeys  are
    \ changed  frequently;  the  exact  frequency  depends upon the\noptions negotiated,
    but may be every packet.  MPPE is negotiated  within\noption 18 [6] in the Compression
    Control Protocol.\n \nThis  document describes the method used to derive the initial
    MPPE ses-\nsion keys from MS-CHAP credentials.  The algorithm used to  change
    \ ses-\nsion keys during a session is described in [4].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
