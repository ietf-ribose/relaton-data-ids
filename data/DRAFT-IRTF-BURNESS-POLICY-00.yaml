abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When considering a new routing system, we need to ensure that
    it is\nable to meet the functionality requirements of the participant\nnetworks.
    \ One aspect that is frequently over-looked is that routing\nis rarely a simple
    matter of choosing a least-hop path.  This\ndocument attempts to highlight some
    of the more common policy choices\nthat are made.  We expect that policies that
    are in common use today\nshould be easy to implement with any new routing schemes.
    \ Any\nrouting scheme make it possible or significantly easier to implement\nthe
    harder policies would have an implementation advantage.\n\t </p>\n      "
