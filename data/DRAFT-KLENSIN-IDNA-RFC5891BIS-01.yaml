abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names
    combine\n   rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without\n
    \  violating the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility,\n   consistent
    with earlier specifications, for determining the labels\n   that are allowed in
    particular zones.  Conformance to IDNA by\n   registries and other implementations
    requires both parts.  Experience\n   strongly suggests that the language describing
    those responsibilities\n   was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable
    use of the\n   specifications and that more details and some specific examples
    would\n   have been helpful.  Without making any substantive changes to IDNA,\n
    \  this specification updates two of the core IDNA documents (RFC 5980\n   and
    5891) and the IDNA explanatory document (RFC 5894) to provide\n   that guidance
    and to correct some technical errors in the\n   descriptions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
