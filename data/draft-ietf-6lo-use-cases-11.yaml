abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained
    node networks (6lo) and provides practical deployment examples. In addition to
    IEEE Std 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave),
    Bluetooth Low Energy, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and PLC are used as examples. The
    document targets an audience who would like to understand and evaluate running
    end-to-end IPv6 over the constrained node networks for local or Internet connectivity.</p>"
