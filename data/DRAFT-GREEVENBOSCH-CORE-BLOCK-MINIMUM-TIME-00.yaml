abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an \"MinimumBlockTime\" option for CoAP,
    which\n   can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two subsequent\n   block
    requests.  It can be used for overload and congestion control.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion
    and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t
