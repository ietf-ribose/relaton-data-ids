abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\n   ALTO client can ask for guidance
    it needs to discover one or more\n   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.\n\n
    \  In some deployment scenarios, in particular if the information about\n   the
    network topology is partitioned and distributed over several ALTO\n   servers,
    an ALTO client may need to discover an ALTO server outside\n   of its own network
    domain, in order to get appropriate guidance.\n\n   This document details applicable
    scenarios, itemizes requirements,\n   and analyzes existing solution approaches
    for such ALTO cross-domain\n   server discovery.  However, the specification of
    a procedure is\n   beyond the scope of this document.  Note, that in earlier versions
    of\n   this document, ALTO cross-domain server discovery was referred to as\n
    \  \"third-party discovery\", but it has been renamed to avoid naming\n   ambiguities.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
