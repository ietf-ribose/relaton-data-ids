abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication\n
    \  Option (TCP-AO) to encrypt the TCP segment payload in addition to\n   providing
    TCP-AO's authentication of the payload, TCP header, and IP\n   pseudoheader. This
    extension augments how the packet contents and\n   headers are processed and which
    keys are derived, and adds a\n   capability for in-band coordination of unauthenticated
    Diffie-\n   Hellman key exchange at connection establishment. The extension\n
    \  preserves key rollover coordination and protection of long-lived\n   connections.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
