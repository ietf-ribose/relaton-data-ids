abstract:
  content: "<p>The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)protocol
    is to provide guidance to applications which have to selectone or several hosts
    from a set of candidates, all of which are ableto provide the desired resource.
    The goal of the mechanismsspecified in this document is to extend the existing
    solution, andprovide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network-aware.
    These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer theguidance or costs using
    Network Location identifiers/PIDs, calledCPIDs. And the exisiting The proposed
    solution inherits the existingsolution's architecture, messages, and other mechanisms.
    It can beused as an independent solution or function together with otherfunctions
    in the existing solution to provide guidance for differentclient and balance the
    workload on the server. Additional detailsfor the process will be provided in
    the next version of the draft.</p>"
