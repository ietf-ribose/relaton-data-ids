abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with
    associated data (AEAD) that are based on the composition of the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation for encryption,
    and the HMAC-SHA message authentication code (MAC). These are randomized encryption
    algorithms, and thus are suitable for use with applications that cannot provide
    distinct nonces to each invocation of the AEAD encrypt operation.</p>"
