abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Private Information Queries (PIQ) is an Internet protocol that
    allows\n   making a phone number query directly to the target cell phone.  The\n
    \  target user can decide whether or not a phone number should be\n   returned;
    in real-time and on a case-by-case basis.\n\n   PIQ may also be used for bootstrapping
    IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange).\n   Along with a phone number, the querier can
    securely obtain a fixed IP\n   address e.g., a Mobile IPv6 home address, exchange
    certificates and\n   initiate IKEv2 with the target host.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
