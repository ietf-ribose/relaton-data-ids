abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes conventions for using MIDI to generate
    tones\n   on SIP UAs.  This does not define any changes to SIP but describes\n
    \  how to use the existing Alert-Info header to play tones that can be\n   used
    to indicate specialized PSTN tones such as the ringback tones\n   from various
    countries.  The tones are described using MIDI which\n   results in a compact
    representation that is simple for a UA to\n   generate and easy to render into
    audio.\n\n   This work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.\n
    \  This draft was revived at request of a few people so it could be\n   discussed.
    \ Parts of it need to be updated since it was written in\n   2003.\n\t </p>\n
