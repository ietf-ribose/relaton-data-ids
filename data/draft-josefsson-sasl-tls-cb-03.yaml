abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specify how to compute the 'tls-unique-prf' data that
    is cryptographically bound to a specific Transport Layer Security (TLS) session.
    The intention is to use this data as a name of the secure channel for the purpose
    of a channel binding. The channel bindings can be used by authentication protocols
    to avoid tunneling attacks and security layer re-use. The data is derived using
    the TLS Pseudo-Random Function (PRF). Applications of this include SASL- based
    protocols like IMAP, SMTP and XMPP. The channel binding 'tls- unique-prf' defined
    in this document is an alternative to 'tls- unique' as described by RFC 5929 and
    used by SCRAM and GS2.</p>"
