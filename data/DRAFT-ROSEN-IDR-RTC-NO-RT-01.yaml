abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP routes sometimes carry an \"Extended Communities\" path
    attribute.\n   An Extended Communities path attribute can contain one or more
    \"Route\n   Targets\" (RTs).  By means of a procedure known as \"RT Constrained\n
    \  Distribution\" (RTC), a BGP speaker can send BGP UPDATE messages that\n   express
    its interest in a particular set of RTs.  Generally, RTC has\n   been applied
    only to address families whose routes always carry RTs.\n   When RTC is applied
    to such an address family, a BGP speaker\n   expressing its interest in a particular
    set of RTs is indicating that\n   it wants to receive all and only the routes
    of that address family\n   that have at least one of the RTs of interest.  However,
    there are\n   scenarios in which the originator of a route chooses not to include\n
    \  any RTs at all, assuming that the distribution of a route with no RTs\n   at
    all will be unaffected by RTC.  This has led to interoperability\n   problems
    in the field, where the originator of a route assumes that\n   RTC will not affect
    the distribution of the route, but intermediate\n   BGP speakers refuse to distribute
    that route because it does not\n   carry any RT of interest.  The purpose of this
    document is to clarify\n   the effect of the RTC mechanism on routes that do not
    have any RTs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
