abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   XXX Author Note: The WG are being asked to consider changing
    this\n   title - see list XXX\n\n   This document describes the potential benefits
    and pitfalls when\n   applications enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).
    \ It\n   outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput,\n   reduced
    delay and other benefits when ECN is used over network paths\n   that include
    equipment that supports ECN-marking.  It also lists\n   potential problems that
    might occur when ECN is used.  The document\n   does not propose new algorithms
    that may be able to use ECN or\n   describe the details of implementation of ECN
    in endpoint devices,\n   routers and other network devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
