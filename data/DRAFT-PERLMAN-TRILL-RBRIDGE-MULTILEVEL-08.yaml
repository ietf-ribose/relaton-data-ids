abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Extending TRILL to multiple levels has one challenge that is
    not\n   addressed by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have\n   multiple
    levels.  The issue is with TRILL switch nicknames. There\n   have been two proposed
    approaches.  One approach, which we refer to\n   as the \"unique nickname\" approach,
    gives unique nicknames to all the\n   TRILL switches in the multilevel campus,
    either by having the\n   level-1/level-2 border TRILL switches advertise which
    nicknames are\n   not available for assignment in the area, or by partitioning
    the\n   16-bit nickname into an \"area\" field and a \"nickname inside the area\"\n
    \  field.  The other approach, which we refer to as the \"aggregated\n   nickname\"
    approach, involves assigning nicknames to the areas, and\n   allowing nicknames
    to be reused in different areas, by having the\n   border TRILL switches rewrite
    the nickname fields when entering or\n   leaving an area. Each of those approaches
    has advantages and\n   disadvantages. The design in this document allows a choice
    of\n   approach in each area, allowing the simplicity of the unique nickname\n
    \  approach in installations in which there is no danger of running out\n   of
    nicknames, and allowing nickname rewriting to be phased into\n   larger installations
    on a per-area basis.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
