abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Future communication networks will be based more and more on
    a\n   dynamically changing network topology.  Therefore it is advantageous,\n
    \  to have routing mechanisms, which will dynamically adapt their\n   routing
    decisions to these topology changes.  This document describes\n   a set of network
    protocols, which realize such a dynamical routing of\n   unicast and multicast
    packets within communication networks based on\n   IPv6.  All used routing algorithms
    will be immediately executed at\n   the occurrence of any topology changes and
    will therefore have\n   already complete routing information at the receipt of
    data packets.\n \n   For the unicasting the Shortest Path First (SPF) routing
    algorithm\n   has be chosen.  This algorithm calculates the shortest, and therefore\n
    \  the optimal routing paths within the routing area, by which it is\n   sufficient
    for a router, to compute a single routing tree for the\n   whole area.\n \n   For
    the multicasting the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) routing\n   algorithm has been
    chosen.  This distributed algorithm prevents the\n   occurrence of endless routing
    loops, offers for distributed Address\n   Groups nearly optimal results in saving
    network bandwidth, and needs\n   also only a single routing tree for the whole
    area. This version 02\n   of the draft mainly corrects some minor errors of version
    01.\n\t </p>\n      "
