abstract:
  content: "<p>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type and data model can
    be used to send collections of resources, such as batches of sensor data or configuration
    parameters. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH
    methods enable accessing and updating parts of a resource or multiple resources
    with one request. This document defines new media types for the CoAP FETCH, PATCH,
    and iPATCH methods for resources represented using the SenML data model.</p>"
