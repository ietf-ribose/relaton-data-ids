abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6374 describes methods of making loss and delay measurements
    on\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) primarily as used in MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    (MPLS-TP) networks.  This document describes a method of\n   extending RFC 6374
    performance measurements from flows carried over\n   MPLS-TP to flows carried
    over generic MPLS LSPs.  In particular, it\n   extends the technique to allow
    loss and delay measurements to be made\n   on multi-point to point LSPs and introduces
    some additional\n   techniques to allow more sophisticated measurements to be
    made in\n   both MPLS-TP and generic MPLS networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
