abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the transition requirements for an
    IPv6\n   Customer Edge (CE) router, either provided by the service provider or\n
    \  thru the retail market.\n\n   Specifically, this document extends the \"Basic
    Requirements for IPv6\n   Customer Edge Routers\" ([RFC7084]) in order to allow
    the provisioning\n   of IPv6 transition services for the support of IPv4 as a
    Service\n   (IPv4aaS) by means of new transition mechanisms, which where not\n
    \  available at the time [RFC7084] was published.  The document only\n   covers
    transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only\n   access networks,
    commonly called IPv4 \"as-a-service\" (IPv4aaS), as\n   required in a world where
    IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so\n   hosts in the customer LANs with
    IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications\n   or devices, requiring to communicate with
    IPv4-only services at the\n   Internet, are still able to do so.\n\n\t </p>\n
