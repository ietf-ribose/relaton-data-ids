abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may usean
    IP backbone to provide VPNs for its customers. MPLS is used forforwarding packets
    over the backbone, and BGP is used fordistributing routes over the backbone. The
    primary goal of thismethod is to support the case in which a client obtains IP
    backboneservices from a Service Provider or Service Providers with which itmaintains
    contractual relationships. The client may be anenterprise, a group of enterprises
    which need an extranet, anInternet Service Provider, an application service provider,
    anotherVPN Service Provider which uses this same method to offer VPNs toclients
    of its own, etc. The method makes it very simple for theclient to use the backbone
    services. It is also very scalable andflexible for the Service Provider, and allows
    the Service Provider toadd value.</p>"
