abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines operating semantics of the Cloud Tunneling
    Protocol (CTP). CTP enables a standardized mechanism for connecting Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices to hosted cloud services. CTP provides a network efficient means
    to facilitate multiple concurrent data conversations over the same channel by
    providing multiplexed virtual sockets. The protocol allows for services on either
    endpoint to be advertised and accessible to each endpoint of the CTP connection.</p>"
