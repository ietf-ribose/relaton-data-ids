abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn
    in routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for being
    well connected because topological richness amplifies the number of update messages
    exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD off.  Based on experimental measurement,
    this document recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits
    in order to reduce the high risks with RFD.  The result is damping a non-trivial
    amount of long-term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence
    process.\n\t </p>\n      "
