    to IPsec tunnel mode client endpoints. Single user computers that are connecting
    into corporations via Internet Service Providers, ISP's, using Tunnel mode IPsec
    may need to have configuration information supplied to them, such as inner ip
    address, DNS server addresses, WINS server addresses, etc. This document describes
    a method utilized by New Oak Communications to pass these parameters between it's
