abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo expands on the Selective Acknowledgement Protocol
    described\n   in RFC2018 to improve its performance and efficiency while reducing\n
    \  the delay involved in recovering lost segments.  This leads to very\n   reliable
    and efficient communications regardless of transit delay or\n   high levels of
    lost segments due to noise or congestion.  It\n   introduces a fundamentally new
    way of looking at Selective\n   Acknowledgement and uses this concept to improve
    the performance of\n   the RFC2018 protocol.  This memo proposes an implementation
    of the\n   improved SACK and discusses its performance and related issues.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
