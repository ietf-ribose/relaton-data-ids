abstract:
  content: "<p>This document identifies the importance and use cases of source address
    validation (SAV) at both intra-AS level and inter-AS level (see [RFC5210]). However,
    existing intra-AS and inter-AS SAV mechanisms, either Ingress ACL filtering [RFC2827],
    unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704], or Enhanced Feasible-Path uRPF
    (EFP-uRPF) [RFC8704] has limitations in scalability or accuracy. This document
    provides the gap analysis of the existing SAV mechanisms followed with some design
    considerations.</p>"
