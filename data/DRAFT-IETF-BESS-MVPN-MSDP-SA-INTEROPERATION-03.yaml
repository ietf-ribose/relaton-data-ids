abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between\n
    \  MVPN Source Active routes and customer MSDP Source Active routes,\n   which
    is useful for MVPN provider networks offering services to\n   customers with an
    existing MSDP infrastructure.  Without the\n   procedures described in this document,
    VPN-specific MSDP sessions are\n   required among the PEs that are customer MSDP
    peers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
