abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines two Notify Message Type Payloads for
    the\n   Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) indicating support\n
    \  for the negotiation of multiple identical Child SAs to optimize\n   performance.\n\n
    \  The CPU_QUEUES notification indicates support for multiple queues or\n   CPUs.
    \ The CPU_QUEUE_INFO notification are used to confirm and\n   optionally convey
    information about the specific queue, such as QoS\n   level.\n\n   Using multiple
    identical Child SAs has the benefit that each stream\n   has its own Sequence
    Number Counter, ensuring that CPUs don't have to\n   synchronize their crypto
    state or disable their packet replay\n   protection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
