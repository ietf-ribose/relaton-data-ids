abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a set of requirements and a framework
    for \n   providing a Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire (PW). The requirements \n
    \  identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling \n   and
    maintenance aspects of Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are \n   proposed
    as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms. \n   Among other potential
    applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be \n   used to optimize the support
    of multicast layer 2 services (Virtual \n   Private LAN Service and Virtual Private
    Multicast Service) as defined \n   in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network Working
    Group.\n\t </p>\n      "
