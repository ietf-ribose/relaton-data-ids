abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a payload format, which can be used for
    the\ntransport of both MPEG-4 Elementary Streams (ES) as well as MPEG-4\nSync
    Layer packet streams, in RTP [1] packets.  The payload format\nallows for protection
    against loss in a generic way, through frag-\nmentation, grouping and extension
    data mechanisms, which can dynamically adapt to network conditions. These mechanisms
    can operate both\non full and partial MPEG-4 Access Units, such as Sync Layer
    packets,\nor typed segments,   These mechanisms can cover a broad range of\nprotection
    schemes and avoid extra connection management complexity\n- e.g. for separate
    FEC channels - in MPEG-4 applications with a high number of streams.\n\t </p>\n
