  content: "<p>In a public wireless local area network (WLAN) access service using
    Mobile IP, network elements (NEs), such as access points (APs), DHCP server (DHCPS)
    and home agents (HAs), are required to authenticate users to prevent unauthorized
    usage. In this document, we discuss authentication/authorization process using
    Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) key derived during access authentication.</p>"
