abstract:
- content: "<p>The GEOPRIV Working Group previously specified how to use an IP address
    and port number to request a location based on an individual packet flow. However
    certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends of the packet flow
    must be specified in order to unambiguously satisfy the location request. This
    document specifieds a Flow Identity Extension for the HTTP- Enabled Location Delivery
    (HELD) Protocol to support this requirement.</p>"
