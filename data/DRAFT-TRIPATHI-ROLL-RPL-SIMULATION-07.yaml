abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a performance evaluation of the Routing\n
    \  Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for a small outdoor\n   deployment
    of sensor nodes and for a large scale smart meter network.\n   Detailed simulations
    are carried out to produce several routing\n   performance metrics using these
    real-life deployment scenarios.\n\nnote\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
