- content: "<p>This document describes technical mechanisms censorship regimes around
    the world use for blocking or impairing Internet traffic. It aims to make designers,

    and mechanisms used for censoring end-user access to information. This document
    makes no suggestions on individual protocol considerations, and is purely informational,
    intended as a reference.</p>"
