abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be
    used on\n   networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have\n
    \  an impact on society through its normative standards setting process.\n   Among
    other things, the IETF's work affects what is perceived as\n   technologically
    possible and useful where networking technologies are\n   being deployed, and
    its standards reflect what is considered by the\n   technical community to be
    feasible and good practice.  Whereas there\n   might not be agreement among the
    Internet protocol community on the\n   specific political nature of the technological
    development process\n   and its outputs, it is undisputed that standards and protocols
    are\n   both products of a political process, and they can also be used for\n
    \  political means.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
