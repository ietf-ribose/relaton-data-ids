abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RTCWEB is in the process of developing a protocol infrastructure
    and\n   a browser API to support browser-to-browser real-time communication\n
    \  over IP.  Real-time communication necessarily requires the use of\n   encoders
    and decoders (codecs) for media data.  The document\n   advocates mandating support
    for a class of codecs known as scalable\n   or layered codecs, for their superior
    network adaptivity, error\n   resilience, and application adaptivity.  Examples
    are provided for\n   use cases currently under discussion, focusing on video coding
    as\n   the, perhaps, most challenging media type currently under\n   consideration.\n\n\t
