abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Networks [RFC7432] are becoming prevalent
    in\n   Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and Service Provider VPN\n
    \  applications. One of the goals that EVPN pursues is the reduction of\n   flooding
    and the efficiency of CE-based control plane procedures in\n   Broadcast Domains.
    Examples of this are Proxy ARP/ND and IGMP/MLD\n   Proxy. This document complements
    the latter, describing the\n   procedures required to minimize the flooding of
    PIM messages in EVPN\n   Broadcast Domains, and optimize the IP Multicast delivery
    between PIM\n   routers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
