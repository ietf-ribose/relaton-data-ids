abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the problem of configuring a large number of
    IKE/IPsec systems in such a way that any two of them can use IPsec to protect
    the traffic between them. Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too
    cumbersome in such cases, so an automated method is needed.</p>"
