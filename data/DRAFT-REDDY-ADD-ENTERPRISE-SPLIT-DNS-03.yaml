abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When split-horizon DNS is deployed by an enterprise, certain\n
    \  enterprise domains are only resolvable by querying the network-\n   designated
    DNS server.  DNS clients which use DNS servers not\n   provided by the network
    need to route those DNS domain queries to the\n   network-designated DNS server.
    \ This document informs DNS clients of\n   split-horizon DNS, their DNS domains,
    and is compatible with\n   encrypted DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
