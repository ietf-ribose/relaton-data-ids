abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes modifications to the AES-GCM algorithm
    \nto allow separation of the data authenticity and data \nconfidentiality keys,
    while preserving the performance benefits \nof the algorithm. When AES-GCM is
    applied to network protocols\n such as IPsec and TLS, separation of these keys
    allows the data \nconfidentiality key to be shared with trusted intermediary nodes
    \non the network, while preserving the data authenticity functions \nin an end-to-end
    manner. The current definition of AES-GCM uses \na single key for confidentiality
    and authenticity hence it is \nnot possible to share the key with trusted network
    nodes, \nwithout compromising the data authenticity functions.\n\t </p>\n      "
