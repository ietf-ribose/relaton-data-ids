abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies two new algorithms. One is the usage of XCBC mode
    with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating
    Security Payload and Authentication Header protocols. This algorithm is called
    Camellia-XCBC-96. Latter is pseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia
    block cipher for Internet Key Exchange. This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-
    128.</p>"
