abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo specifies two new algorithms. One is the usage of XCBCmode
    with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism ofthe IPsec Encapsulating
    Security Payload and Authentication Headerprotocols. This algorithm is called
    Camellia-XCBC-96. Latter ispseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia
    block cipher forInternet Key Exchange. This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-128.</p>"
