abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies requirements for IPv6 forwarders as they
    process\n   packets with long header chains.  It also provides guidance for\n
    \  application developers whose applications might rely on long headers\n   chains.\n\n
    \  As background, this memo explains how many ASIC-based IPv6 forwarders\n   process
    packets and why processing of packets with long header chains\n   might be problematic.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
