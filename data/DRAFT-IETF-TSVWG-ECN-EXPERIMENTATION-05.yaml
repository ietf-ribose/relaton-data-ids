abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo updates RFC 3168, which specifies Explicit Congestion\n
    \  Notification (ECN) as a replacement for packet drops as indicators of\n   network
    congestion.  It relaxes restrictions in RFC 3168 that would\n   otherwise hinder
    experimentation towards benefits beyond just removal\n   of loss.  This memo summarizes
    the anticipated areas of\n   experimentation and updates RFC 3168 to enable experimentation
    in\n   these areas.  An Experimental RFC is required to take advantage of\n   any
    of these enabling updates.  In addition, this memo makes related\n   updates to
    the ECN specifications for RTP in RFC 6679 and for DCCP in\n   RFC 4341, RFC 4342
    and RFC 5622.  This memo also records the\n   conclusion of the ECN Nonce experiment
    in RFC 3540, and provides the\n   rationale for reclassification of RFC 3540 as
    Historic; this\n   reclassification enables new experimental use of the ECT(1)\n
    \  codepoint.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
