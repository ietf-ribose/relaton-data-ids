abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model.
    \ The model\n   defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series.  First,\n
    \  policy definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series\n   Working
    Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC\n   Series Approval
    Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals.  Second,\n   policy implementation
    is primarily the responsibility of the RFC\n   Production Center (RPC) as contractually
    overseen by the IETF\n   Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 8728.  This document updates RFC 7841,\n   RFC
    8729, and RFC 8730.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
