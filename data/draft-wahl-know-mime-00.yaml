abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines directory information profiles for representing
    directory distribution knowledge for an X.500 or LDAP directory system, to be
    carried in an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The profiles consists of
    type definitions and the corresponding format of values that each type is allowed
    to contain. They are designed for simple generation and parsing by programs; the
    text-based format makes it easier for developers and directory administrators
    to debug problems. Additional documents will build on these specifications in
    defining text-based protocols for distributed directory server administration.</p>"
