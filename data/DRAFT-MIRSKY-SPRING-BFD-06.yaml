abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages the paradigm of
    source\n   routing.  It can be realized in the Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS) network without any change to the data plane.  A segment is\n   encoded
    as an MPLS label, and an ordered list of segments is encoded\n   as a stack of
    labels.  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is\n   expected to monitor any
    existing path between systems.  This document\n   defines how to use Label Switched
    Path Ping to bootstrap a BFD\n   session, control path in reverse direction of
    the SR-MPLS tunnel and\n   applicability of BFD Demand mode in the SR-MPLS domain.\n\n\t
