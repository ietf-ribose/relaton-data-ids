abstract:
- content: "<p>The iCalendar data format is being updated and included in those discussions
    is the desire to update the time zone information. This is a proposal for time
    zone updates to iCalendar. The time zone information will be available in XML
    format. To comment on this document send email to ietf-calendar@imc.org . This
    document also specifies an IANA registration process for time zones. No attempt
    is made to specify any specific time zones as that is political information that
    is out of scope for this document.</p>"
