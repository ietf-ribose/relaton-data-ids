abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches\n   including
    point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area\n   Network) links that
    can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations\n   attached. TRILL uses IS-IS
    (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n   System) routing. This document specifies
    the establishment,\n   reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL
    switches,\n   also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-local\n
    \  aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum\n   Transmission
    Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-\n   Directional Forwarding Detection)
    session bootstrapping in connection\n   with adjacency. State diagrams are included
    where appropriate.  This\n   document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\n\t
