abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered
    when\n   creating an Internet protocol.  This draft suggests that similar\n   considerations
    may apply for other human rights such as freedom of\n   expression or freedom
    of association.  A proposal is made for\n   initiating IRTF work researching the
    possible connections between\n   human rights and Internet standards and protocols.
    \ The goal would be\n   to create an informational RFC concerning human rights
    protocol\n   considerations.\n\n   Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@article19.io\n\n\t
