abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a new BGP Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (BGP NLRI) Path Attribute, AppMetaData, that can\n   distribute
    the 5G Edge Computing App running status and\n   environment, so that other routers
    in the 5G Local Data\n   Network can make intelligent decision on optimized forwarding\n
    \  of flows from UEs. The goal is to improve latency and\n   performance for 5G
    Edge Computing services.\n\n   The extension enables a feature, called soft anchoring,
    which\n   makes one Edge Computing Server at one specific location to be\n   more
    preferred than others for the same application to receive\n   packets from a specific
    source (UE).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
