abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway
    Protocol\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format\n
    \  that can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This\n   allows
    the routing system to propagate information regarding more\n   specific components
    of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP\n   destination prefix.  This draft
    specifices IPv4 traffic flow\n   specificaitnos.  Other drafst specify , IPv6),
    MPLS addresses, L2VPN\n   addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses.  The
    information\n   is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol algorithms,\n
    \  operational experience, and administrative processes such as inter-\n   provider
    peering agreements.\n\n   There are applications of that encoding format: 1) automation
    of\n   inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is\n   required
    in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service\n   attacks; 2) enable traffic
    filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN\n   service, and 3) aid centralized
    control of traffic in a SDN or NFV\n   context.  Some of deployments of these
    three applications can be\n   handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic
    flow filters,\n   and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow\n
    \  Specification actions.  This defines the first two applications.\n\n   This
    document provides the definition of a BGP NLRI which carries\n   traffic flow
    specification filters, and Extended Community values\n   which encode the actions
    a routing system can take if a packet\n   matches the traffic flow filters.  The
    specification requires that\n   the BGP Flow Specification traffic filters follows
    a string ordering,\n   and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended Communities
    actions are\n   processed in a defined order.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
