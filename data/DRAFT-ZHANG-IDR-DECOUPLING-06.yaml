abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a novel mitigation scheme to protect the
    inter-\n   domain data delivery during false routing announcements. A new path\n
    \  attribute is defined to Decouple propagation of a path and adoption\n   of
    a path for data forwarding in BGP (DBGP). DBGP does not use\n   suspicious paths
    for data forwarding, but still propagates them in\n   the routing system to facilitate
    attack detection. It can extensively\n   protect data delivery from routing announcements
    of false sub-\n   prefixes, false origins, false nodes and false links, and works
    well\n   with ongoing attack detection and prevention systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
