abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Argon2 memory-hard function for
    password\n   hashing and proof-of-work applications.  We provide an implementer-\n
    \  oriented description together with sample code and test vectors.  The\n   purpose
    is to simplify adoption of Argon2 for Internet protocols.\n   This document is
    a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t </p>\n
