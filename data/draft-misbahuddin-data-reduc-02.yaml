abstract:
  content: "<p>In recent era of Information Technology the data traffic over theInternet
    is increasing uncontrollably. This proliferation of datatraffic is due to general
    shift towards e-business and other application of Information Technology. The
    businesses relying onInternet lose billions of dollars each year due to slow or
    failed web services. Therefore, in Internet research, the mostconspicuous issue
    is to develop methodologies to reduce nettraffic over the Internet. In this paper,
    an algorithm is proposedto reduce net data traffic, which works at Internet layer
    in TCP/IPreference model. The algorithm monitors data repetitions in IPdatagram
    and prepares a compression code in response of thisrepetition. If no IP datagrams
    are repeated, no compression codeis sent. Therefore, the algorithm does not put
    any overhead onthe system. Furthermore, as the proposed algorithm works at IPdatagrams
    only, therefore, it remains transparent from allclient-server applications.</p>"
