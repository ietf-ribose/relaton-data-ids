abstract:
  content: "\t <t>With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scaleISPs
    are now facing the option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner.However, most existing
    IPv6 transition solutions have tradeoffbetween scalability and efficiency. This
    draft proposes a lightweightaddress family transition mechanism named LAFT6. It
    only needs tomaintain per-subscriber state entries in core network and there is
    nospecific address format requirement for users' IPv6 address. It is alightweight
    solution in terms of state-management, addressing androuting. The experimental
    results have shown that LAFT6 is scalableand can be rapidly deployed in commercial
    ISP network.</p>"
