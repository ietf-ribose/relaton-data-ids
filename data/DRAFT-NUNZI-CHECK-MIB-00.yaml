abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community,\n
    \  that is targeted at increasing scalability of network monitoring via\n   SNMP.
    \ In particular, the MIB module defined in this document\n   describes a set of
    managed objects that allow to define a check\n   procedure on a managed device.
    \ The result of the  check is\n   accumulated into a single managed object that
    can be read by a\n   manager instead of reading all individual managed objects
    to be\n   checked during the check procedure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
