abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the
    client,\n   in a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is no\n
    \  longer valid because the user is logged out of the service.  This is,\n   in
    particular, considered a potential security problem by some\n   sensitive services,
    such as online banking, when the user navigates\n   the client's history list,
    which is supposed to display the resource\n   as it was when it was loaded, not
    as it is the time the user\n   navigates to it.\n\n   This document presents a
    method for collecting such sensitive\n   resources into a group, called a \"Cache
    Context\", which permits the\n   server to invalidate all the resources belonging
    in the group either\n   by direct action, or according to some expiration policy.
    \ The\n   context can be configured to invalidate not just the resources, but\n
    \  also specific cookies, HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP over\n   TLS
    session information.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
