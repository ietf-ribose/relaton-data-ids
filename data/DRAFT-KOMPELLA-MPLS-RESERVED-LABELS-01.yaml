abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are a limited number of reserved labels defined for Multi-\n
    \  Protocol Label Switching.  Thus one must be cautious in the\n   allocation
    of new reserved labels, yet at the same time allow forward\n   progress when a
    new reserved label is called for.  This memo suggests\n   some procedures to follow
    in the allocation and retirement of\n   reserved labels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
