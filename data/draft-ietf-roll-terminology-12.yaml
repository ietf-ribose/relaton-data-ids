abstract:
- content: "<p>The documents defines a terminology for discussing routing requirements
    and solutions for networks referred to as Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN).
    An LLN is typically composed of many embedded devices with limited power, memory,
    and processing resources interconnected by a variety of links. There is a wide
    scope of application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building
    automation (e.g. Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, lighting, access control,
    fire), connected home, healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks,
    energy management, assets tracking, refrigeration.</p>"
