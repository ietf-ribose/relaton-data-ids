abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient
    IP\nconfiguration change detection procedures than traditional fixed\nhosts.  DNA
    is defined as the process by which a host collects\nappropriate information and
    detects the identity of its currently\nattached link to ascertain the validity
    of its IP configuration.\nThis document details best current practice for Detecting
    Network\nAttachment in IPv6 hosts using existing Neighbor Discovery\nprocedures.
    \ Since there is no explicit link identification mechanism\nin the existing Neighbor
    Discovery for IP Version 6, the document\ndescribes implicit mechanisms for identifying
    the current link.\n\t </p>\n      "
