abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order to diagnose problems with the Peer-RPF-Flooding mechanismsin
    the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol [2], we introduce amethod of tracing the
    path that an SA message should have taken,along with collecting statistics along
    that path. This occurs in away similar to multicast traceroute [3], with each
    router appendinginformation about this hop and forwarding the message towards
    thedesired RP.</p>"
