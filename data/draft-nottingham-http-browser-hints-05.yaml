abstract:
- content: "<p>Over time, HTTP clients -- especially Web browsers -- have adapted
    how they use the protocol based upon common server configurations and behaviours.
    While this is necessary in the common case, it can be detrimental for performance
    and interoperability. This document establishes a mechanism whereby both origin
    servers and intermediaries can make hints available to clients about their preferences
    and capabilities, without imposing undue overhead on their interactions or requiring
    support for them. This is intended to allow clients to safely optimise connections
    to servers.</p>"
