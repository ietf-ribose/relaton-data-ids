abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes aspects of 'multi-tier' architecture,\n'Grid-net',
    addressing architecture, 'address plane', 'address swapping','address option',
    and revises aspects of the security, precedence of the Standard Internet Protocol
    to suit newly development trend of Internet, Municipal Area Network, and 'Home-net'.
    This addressing architecture provides much more capacious address space by attached
    32-bit 'Grid' IP address for transmitting datagram from sources to destinations,
    where hosts identified by twin 32-bit IP addresses, i.e. to provide 'non-private'
    32-bit IP address for transmission in adding 'Grid' tier, and scalable service
    for data, voice, signaling, and multimedia. The proposed protocol provides of
    seamless integration with existing Internet, tier border address swapping for
    transmission throughout public Internet tier, IP address planes inside Grid-net
    for data, IP phone, mobile phone, wireless PAD, video and other multimedia\napplications,
    and IP address personality for personal computer, IP\nphone, mobile phone, wireless
    PAD, home control, monitoring, and\nmultimedia equipments.\nThe goal of this document
    is to implement a compatible protocol, to\ncreate new Internet Multimedia Environment,
    and to protect worldwide\ninvestment on network resources.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
