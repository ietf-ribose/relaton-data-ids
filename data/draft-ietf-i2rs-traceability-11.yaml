abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for traceability in the Interface
    to the Routing System (I2RS) and the information model for that framework. It
    specifies the motivation, requirements, and use cases, and defines an information
    model for recording interactions between elements implementing the I2RS protocol.
    This framework provides a consistent tracing interface for components implementing
    the I2RS architecture to record what was done, by which component, and when. It
    aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be used for troubleshooting,
    auditing, forensics, and accounting purposes.</p>"
