abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\nrouting
    protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\nProtocol (TCP/IP)
    networks.  BGP requires that all BGP speakers\nwithin a single autonomous system
    (AS) must be fully meshed.  This\nrepresents a serious scaling problem that has
    been well documented in\na number of proposals.\nThis document describes an extension
    to BGP which may be used to\ncreate a confederation of autonomous systems that
    is represented as a\nsingle autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation,\nthereby
    removing the 'full mesh' requirement.  The intention of this\nextension is to
    aid in policy administration and reduce the\nmanagement complexity of maintaining
    a large autonomous system.\n\t </p>\n      "
