abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new protocol for mobile internetworking: the
    Internet Packet Transmission Protocol (IPTP). IPTP provides packet forwarding
    and host location functions that make mobility transparent to all protocols above
    IP. IPTP specifies control messages between the networking software on mobile
    hosts and a special Packet Forwarding Service. Backward compatibility is provided
    by requiring no modifications to stationary hosts or internetwork routers. To
    reduce overhead, IPTP provides for lazy propagation of location updates. To enhance
    performance, routes adapt as mobile hosts move.</p>"
