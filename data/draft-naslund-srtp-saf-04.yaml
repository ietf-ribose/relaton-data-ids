abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes the use of so called store-and-forwardcryptographic
    transforms within the Secure Real-time TransportProtocol (SRTP). The motivation
    is to support use cases when twoend-points communicate via one (or more) store-and-forwardmiddleboxes
    that are not fully trusted to access the media content.One of the main aspects
    of the transform is to make theconfidentiality and message authentication independent
    of the RTPheader. Another central aspect is to enable identification of thecryptographic
    context (keys etc.). Besides the security of the end-points, also trust assumptions
    regarding the store-and-forwardmiddleboxes are addressed.</p>"
