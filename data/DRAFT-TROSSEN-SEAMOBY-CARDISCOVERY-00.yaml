abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A critical requirement in the protocols being designed for seamless
    \nIP-level handovers, such as fast handover and context transfer, is \nthat the
    target access router (TAR) for the mobile node's (MN) \nhandover is known to the
    current access router (AR). The TAR needs to \nhave the capability set necessary
    to meet the MN's requirements, and \nmeet any local policy requirements. While
    the TAR selection process \nhappens at the time of handover, the ARs which have
    the capabilities \nto meet the MN's requirements can be identified in advance.
    These \nARs are called candidate access routers (CARs).\n\t </p>\n      "
