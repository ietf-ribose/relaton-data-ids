abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a problem statement and general requirements
    for distributed autonomic configuration of multiple aspects of networks, in particular
    carrier networks. The basic model is that network elements need to negotiate configuration
    settings with each other to meet overall goals. The document describes a generic
    negotiation behavior model. The document also reviews whether existing management
    and configuration protocols may be suitable for autonomic networks.</p>"
