abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's optical service
    \nrequirements for the Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) \nfrom both
    an end-user's as well as an operator's perspectives. Its \nfocus is on the description
    of the service building blocks and \nservice-related control plane functional
    requirements. The management \nfunctions for the optical services and their underlying
    networks are \nbeyond the scope of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
