abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340. Service Codes provide a method to identify
    the intended service/application to process a DCCP Connection Request. This provides
    improved flexibility in the use and assignment of port numbers for connection
    multiplexing. The DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination
    of services behind NATs and firewalls. This document motivates the setting of
    Service Codes by applications, rather than assigning a default Service Code value
    of zero.</p>"
