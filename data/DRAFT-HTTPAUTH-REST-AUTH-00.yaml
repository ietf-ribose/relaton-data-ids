abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a \"RESTful\" pattern of authentication
    for\n   HTTP/1.0, 1.1, and 2.0.  The goal is to make it easy to add\n   authentication
    mechanisms to HTTP and to make it easy to implement\n   them even without much
    help from the HTTP stack (though it is best to\n   integrate authentication into
    the stack, of course).\n\n   Among other benefits of RESTauth: it is orthogonal
    to \"HTTP routers\"\n   and proxies, it results in session Uniform Resource Identifiers\n
    \  (URIs) that can be DELETEd to logout, naturally supports multi-legged\n   authentication
    schemes, and it can be universally implemented on the\n   server side with the
    Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and FastCGI.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
