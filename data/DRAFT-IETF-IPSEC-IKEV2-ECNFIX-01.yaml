abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec (IP Security) tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation were
    \nspecified prior to the addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion \nNotification)
    to IP, with the potential result that ECN congestion \nindications could be discarded
    by IPsec tunnel decapsulators.  The \ncurrent ECN specification includes two ECN
    operating modes for \nIPsec tunnels to avoid this situation, and IKEv1/ISAKMP
    (Internet \nKey Exchange/Internet Security Association and Key Management \nProtocol)
    negotiation extensions to enable ECN to be used correctly \nwith IPsec tunnels.
    \ To simplify this situation, IKEv2 requires \nchanges to tunnel decapsulation
    that prevent discarding of ECN \ncongestion indication, obviating the need for
    multiple ECN \noperating modes and associated negotiation support.\n\t </p>\n
