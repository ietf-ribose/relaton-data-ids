abstract:
  content: "<p>Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a subset
    of Flows from all observed Flows. The Intermediate Flow Selection Process may
    be located at an IPFIX Exporter, Collector, or within an IPFIX Mediator. It reduces
    the effort of post-processing Flow data and transferring Flow Records. This document
    describes motivations for using the Intermediate Flow Selection process and presents
    Intermediate Flow Selection techniques. It provides an information model for configuring
    Intermediate Flow Selection Process techniques and discusses what information
    about an Intermediate Flow Selection Process should be exported.</p>"
