abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors, and
    technical implementations at different protocol layers. Multicast data distribution
    is most efficiently performed on the lowest available layer, but a heterogeneous
    deployment status of multicast technologies throughout the Internet requires an
    adaptive service binding at runtime. Today, it is difficult to write an application
    that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most efficient multicast
    service available in the network. Facing robustness requirements, developers are
    frequently forced to use a stable, upper layer protocol provided by the application
    itself. This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for transparent
    communication in underlay and overlay, and grants access to the different multicast
    flavors. It proposes an abstract naming by multicast URIs and discusses mapping
    mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution technologies. Additionally,
    it describes the application of this API for building gateways that interconnect
    current multicast domains throughout the Internet, and reports on an implementation
    of the programming interface including a service middleware. This document is
    a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast Research Group (SAM) Research Group.</p>"
