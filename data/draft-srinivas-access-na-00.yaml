abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The use of the SIP protocol for controlling Networked Appliances
    (NA)has been proposed in several recent IETF drafts including [1] and[2]. The
    issue of controlling access to NAs from a remote deviceis paramount, especially
    in the context of NAs in the home. Thisdraft investigates the issue of where the
    access rules must be storedand executed to control access to an NA. The use of
    proxy gatewayswithin the home domain and their resultant impact on communicationpathways
    between the remote device and the NAs have been studied.</p>"
