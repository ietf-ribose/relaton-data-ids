abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are several different single sign-on (SSO) solutions offered\nby
    various software vendors today. All such solutions require\napplications to be
    written to a vendor specific API. In view of a\nlack of industry wide standard
    for SSO APIs, application\ndevelopers find it almost impossible to SSO enable
    their\napplications to work with any vendor solution. This document\npresents
    alternative SSO implementation architecture that allows\napplications to be transparently
    enabled for SSO. Further, it\nallows different SSO solutions to interoperate with
    relatively\nlittle effort.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
