abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.
    In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
    sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS). This document specifies
    a standard representation and encoding of a Domain-Sequence, which is defined
    as an ordered sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain to
    be used by Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained
    shortest paths across a predetermined sequence of domains . This document also
    defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain identifiers.</p>"
