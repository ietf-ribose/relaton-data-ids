abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RSerPool [1] is a framework to provide highly available services\nbetween
    clients and servers.  This is achieved by grouping servers\ninto pools, each with
    an identifier and pooling policy.  Three\nclasses of entities are defined: Pool
    Users (clients), Pool Elements\n(servers), and Name Servers.\nThis memo defines
    the services provided by this framework to upper\nlayer protocols and applications
    for Pool Users and Pool Elements.\nIt describes the service primitives that the
    framework provides and\ndescribes example scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
