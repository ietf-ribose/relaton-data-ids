abstract:
  content: "<p>This outline contains a short description of the IETF's core work and
    a description of structures and processes which might be used to accomplish it.
    Many of the elements described are already in use either formally or informally.
    This document does, however, propose some new mechanisms to support the work of
    the IETF. The IESG does not believe that this document is complete, nor has it
    decided on a course of action based on this or any other proposal. The IESG does
    hope that presenting an outline set of mechanisms, both old and new, will foster
    discussion. The IESG hopes community will consider both whether the mechanisms
    described here would meet the IETF's needs and, especially, whether the linkages
    among the abstracted functions it describes are adequate and complete.</p>"
