abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In packet transport networks, there are requirements where
    reverse\n   unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same\n
    \  path as its forward unidirectional LSP.  The bidirectional LSP needs\n   to
    maintain co-routed-ness even after a failure event in the network.\n    This document
    describes RSVP signaling to unambiguously bind two co-\n   routed point-to-point
    LSPs into an associated co-routed bidirectional\n   LSP.  Fast-reroute procedures
    are defined to ensure that the traffic\n   flows on the co-routed path after a
    failure event.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
