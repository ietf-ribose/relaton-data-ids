abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet Draft describes, analyzes, and compares differentstrategies
    for allocating addresses, in a way that can be generalizedfor any power-of-two
    sized, binary address space. One such strategyis proposed as being \"optimal\",
    when viewed from the perspective ofspace-packing efficiency. This Draft recommends
    use of thistechnique as a \"Best Current Practice\", for both IPv4 and IPv6address
    allocations.Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft
    or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops.The key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in thisdocument are
    to be interpreted as described in [2]</p>"
