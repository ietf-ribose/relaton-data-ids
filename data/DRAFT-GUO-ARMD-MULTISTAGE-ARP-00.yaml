abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a method to reduce the ARP broadcast
    in L2\n   networks. There will be two MAC tables in the aggregation switches\n
    \  which answer for the ARP responses and packet forwarding. Multicast\n   will
    take the place of broadcast for ARP request in this document\n   which will lead
    to the reduction of the numbers of ARP broadcast\n   packets in L2 networks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
