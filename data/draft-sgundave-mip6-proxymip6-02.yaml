abstract:
- content: "<p>Host based IPv6 mobility is specified in Mobile IPv6 base specification
    [RFC3775]. In that model, the mobile node is responsible for doing the signaling
    to its home agent to enable session continuity as it moves between subnets. The
    design principle in the case of host-based mobility relies on the mobile node
    being in control of the mobility management. Network based mobility allows IP
    session continuity for a mobile node without its involvement in mobility management.
    This specification describes a protocol solution for network based mobility management
    that relies on Mobile IPv6 signaling and reuse of home agent functionality. A
    proxy mobility agent in the network which manages the mobility for a mobile node
    is the reason for referring to this protocol as Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
