abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the rpki-updown protocol
    to\n   provide support for transferring Internet Number Resources from one\n   INR
    holder to another.  Such transfers take place external to the\n   RPKI, using
    procedures defined within and between RIRs.  This\n   protocol facilitates automation
    of the maintenance of RPKI data in\n   the context of INR transfers.  The protocol
    supports asynchronous\n   transfers of live or unused INRs within an RIR or between
    RIRs.  The\n   scope of this protocol is limited to the transfer of Internet Number\n
    \  Resources within the Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  In support\n   of
    this protocol, this document also defines a new signed object type\n   for the
    RPKI repository system, the Transfer Authorization Object\n   (TAO).\n\n\t </p>\n
