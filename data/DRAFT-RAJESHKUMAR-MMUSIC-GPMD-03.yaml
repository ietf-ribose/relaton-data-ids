abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new SDP attribute called general-purpose
    \nmedia descriptor (gpmd).  The gpmd attribute allows the use of new \ninformative
    parameters, gpmd parameters, to qualify existing media \nformats.  These gpmd
    parameters are not part of the standard (e.g., \nMIME) definition of the media
    format and support for them with a \ngiven media format can not be assumed.  Their
    use is therefore \nlimited to cases where they provide information that may be
    of use to \nthe other party in a session but is not critical to the use of the
    \nparticular media format.  This document also defines a specific gpmd \nparameter,
    voice-band data, which can be used to describe a media \nformat as carrying voice-band
    data.  This enables the receiver to \noptimize its handling of the media received.
    \ \n    \n\t </p>\n      "
