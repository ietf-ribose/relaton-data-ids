abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing
    functions\n   apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data\n
    \  path between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions\n   are
    network address translation and firewalling.\n\n   When Application Layer Gateways,
    such as SIP entities, interact with\n   NATs and firewalls, as described in the
    MIDCOM architecture, then\n   problems may occur in the transport of media traffic
    when signaling\n   protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it
    is the\n   case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This\n
    \  document highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is\n   difficult
    for the end points to detect or predict problematic\n   behavior and to determine
    whether the media path is reliably\n   available for packet exchange.\n\n   This
    document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of\n   NAT and firewall
    control, the reasons that they exist, and possible\n   means of improving their
    behavior to allow protocols that rely upon\n   signaling along the media path
    to operate effectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
