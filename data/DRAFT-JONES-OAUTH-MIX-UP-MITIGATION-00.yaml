abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extension to The OAuth 2.0\n
    \  Authorization Framework that enables an authorization server to\n   provide
    a client using it with a consistent set of metadata about\n   itself.  This information
    is returned in the authorization response.\n   It can be used by the client to
    prevent classes of attacks in which\n   the client might otherwise be tricked
    into using inconsistent sets of\n   metadata from multiple authorization servers,
    including potentially\n   using a token endpoint that does not belong to the same
    authorization\n   server as the authorization endpoint used.  Recent research\n
    \  publications refer to these as \"IdP Mix-Up\" and \"Malicious Endpoint\"\n
    \  attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
