abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[RFC 2535] defines a means for storing cryptographic public keys
    in\nthe Domain Name System.  An additional code point is defined for the\nalgorithm
    field of the KEY resource record (RR) to indicate that the\nkey is not stored
    in the KEY RR but is pointed to by the KEY RR.\nEncodings to indicate different
    types of key and pointer formats are\nspecified.\n\n[This draft is moved from
    the DNSSEC WG as part of that WG's merger\ninto me DNSIND WG.  It would have been
    draft-ietf-dnssec-indirect-\nkey-02.txt in the DNSSEC WG.]\n\t </p>\n      "
