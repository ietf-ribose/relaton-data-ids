abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains how to interconnect IPv4 islands over
    a\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv6 cloud.  This\n   approach
    relies on IPv4 Provider Edge routers (4PE), which are Dual\n   Stack in order
    to connect to IPv4 islands and to the MPLS core, which\n   is only required to
    run IPv6 MPLS.  The 4PE routers exchange the IPv4\n   reachability information
    transparently over the core using the\n   Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol
    (MP-BGP) over IPv6.  In doing\n   so, the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey
    the IPv4 address of the\n   4PE router, a field is added in Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (NLRI) to convey the IPv6 address of the 4PE router, so\n   that
    dynamically established IPv6-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) can
    be used without explicit tunnel configuration.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
