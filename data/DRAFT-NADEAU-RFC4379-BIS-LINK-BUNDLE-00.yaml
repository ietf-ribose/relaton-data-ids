abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies extensions to MPLS LSP Ping's\n   tracing
    function as specified in IETF RFC4379 to support\n   link bundle constructs. In
    particular, we extend the \n   Echo Request packet format to include a new Link
    Bundle TLV \n   that can contain both the virtual link bundle interface \n   ID,
    as well as a description of the ECMP algorithm used by \n   said interface. The
    existing downstream mapping processing \n   algorithm for midpoints is modified
    to specify that when link \n   bundles are encountered, that the component links
    should be\n   revealed as would non-component links in the existing\n   algorithm.
    \n\n\t </p>\n      "
