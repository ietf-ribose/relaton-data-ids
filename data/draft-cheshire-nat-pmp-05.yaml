abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating
    Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in the protocol is a
    method for retrieving the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing
    a client to make this external IPv4 address and port known to peers that may wish
    to communicate with it. This protocol is implemented in current Apple products
    including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.</p>"
