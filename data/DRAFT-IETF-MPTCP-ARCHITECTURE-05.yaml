abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Hosts are often connected by multiple paths, but TCP restricts
    communications to a single path per transport connection. Resource usage within
    the network would be more efficient were these multiple paths able to be used
    concurrently. This should enhance user experience through improved resilience
    to network failure and higher throughput.\n\n This document outlines architectural
    guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references
    to how these architectural components come together in the development of a Multipath
    TCP (MPTCP). This document lists certain high-level design decisions that provide
    foundations for the design of the MPTCP protocol, based upon these architectural
    requirements. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
