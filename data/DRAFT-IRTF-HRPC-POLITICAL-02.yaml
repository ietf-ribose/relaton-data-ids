abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be
    used on\n   networks, but the standards development process in the IETF has a\n
    \  normative effect.  Among other things, the IETF's work affects what\n   is
    perceived as technologically possible and useful where networking\n   technologies
    are being deployed, and its standards reflect what is\n   considered by the technical
    community to be feasible and good\n   practice.  Because the IETF's protocols
    mediate many aspects of\n   modern life, and therefore contribute to the ordering
    of societies\n   and communities, the consideration of the potential social impact
    of\n   protocols should be part of the standardization and development\n   process.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
