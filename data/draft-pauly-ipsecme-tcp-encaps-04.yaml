abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to transport IKEv2 and IPSec packets
    over a TCP connection for traversing network middleboxes that may block IKEv2
    negotiation over UDP. This method, referred to as TCP encapsulation, involves
    sending all packets for tunnel establishment as well as tunneled packets over
    a TCP connection. This method is intended to be used as a fallback option when
    IKE cannot be negotiated over UDP.</p>"
