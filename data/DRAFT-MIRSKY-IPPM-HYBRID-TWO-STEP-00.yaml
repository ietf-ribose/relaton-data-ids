abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Development of and advancements in automation of network operations\n
    \  brought new requirements toward measurement methodology.  Among them\n   is
    ability to collect the instant telemetry as the packet being\n   processed by
    the networking elements along its path through the\n   domain.  This document
    introduces new hybrid measurement method,\n   referred to as hybrid two-step,
    as it separates act of measuring and/\n   or calculating performance metric from
    the act of collecting and\n   transporting telemetry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
