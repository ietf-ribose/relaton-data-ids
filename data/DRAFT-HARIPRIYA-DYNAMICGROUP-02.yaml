abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the requirements, semantics, schema
    elements,\n   and operations needed for a dynamic group feature in LDAP.  A dynamic\n
    \  group is defined here as a group object with a membership list of\n   distinguished
    names that is dynamically generated using LDAP search\n   criteria.  The dynamic
    membership list may then be interrogated by\n   LDAP search and compare operations,
    and may also be used to find the\n   groups that an object is a member of.  This
    feature eliminates a huge\n   amount of the administrative effort required today
    for maintaining\n   group memberships and role-based operations in large enterprises.\n\n\t
