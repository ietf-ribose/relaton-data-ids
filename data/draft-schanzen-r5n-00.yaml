abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the R^5N DHT technical specification. This document
    defines the normative wire format of resource records, resolution processes, cryptographic
    routines and security considerations for use by implementers. This specification
    was developed outside the IETF and does not have IETF consensus. It is published
    here to guide implementation of R^5N and to ensure interoperability among implementations.</p>"
