abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new control bit in the IPv6 RA PIO
    flags\n   octet that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive\n
    \  receiver of all traffic destined to any address within that prefix.\n\n   Termed
    the eXclusive bit (or \"X bit\"), nodes that recognize this can\n   perform some
    optimizations to save time and traffic (e.g. disable ND\n   and DAD for addresses
    within this prefix) and more immediately pursue\n   the benefits of being provided
    multiple addresses (vis.  [RFC7934]\n   section 3).  Additionally, network infrastructure
    nodes (routers,\n   switches) can benefit by minimizing the number of {link layer,
    IP}\n   address pairs required to offer network connectivity (vis.  [RFC7934]\n
    \  section 9.3).\n\n   Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing IPv6
    standards\n   compliant implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
