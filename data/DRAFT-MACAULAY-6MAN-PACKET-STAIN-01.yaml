abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the application of security staining
    on an\n   IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining\n
    \  flows, IPv6 nodes forwarding stained packets within a given domain of\n   control,
    and nodes interpreting stains on flows.\n\n   The usage of the packet staining
    destination option enables proactive\n   delivery of security intelligence to
    IPv6 nodes such as firewalls and\n   intrusion prevention systems, and end-points
    such servers,\n   workstations, mobile and smart devices and an infinite array
    of as-\n   yet-to-be-invented sensors and controllers.\n\n   The usage of packet
    staining is not intended for use across the open\n   internet, where fragmentation
    issues associated with increased header\n   size may induce service degradation;
    packet staining is intended as a\n   security adjunct within a given doamin of
    control such as an carrier\n   or enterprise network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
