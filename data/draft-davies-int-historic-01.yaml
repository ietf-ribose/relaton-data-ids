abstract:
- content: <p>The document marks as historic any "int" domain names that were designated
    for infrastructure purposes, and identifies them for removal from the "int" top-level
    domain. Any implementation that involves these domains should be considered deprecated.
    This document also updates [RFC1591] by removing the documented use of "int" for
    international databases.</p>
