abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), in RFC 5730, defines
    the\n   use of authorization information to authorize a transfer of an EPP\n   object,
    such as a domain name, between clients that are referred to\n   as registrars.
    \ Object-specific, password-based authorization\n   information (see RFC 5731
    and RFC 5733) is commonly used, but raises\n   issues related to the security,
    complexity, storage, and lifetime of\n   authentication information.  This document
    defines an operational\n   practice, using the EPP RFCs, that leverages the use
    of strong random\n   authorization information values that are short-lived, not
    stored by\n   the client, and stored by the server using a cryptographic hash
    that\n   provides for secure authorization information that can safely be used\n
    \  for object transfers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
