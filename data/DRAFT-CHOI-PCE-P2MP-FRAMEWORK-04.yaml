abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes the basic concepts of point-to-multipoint
    \n(p2mp) path computation on the basis of the Path Computation Element \nMetric
    Protocol (PCEMP). PCEMP, being soft-memory based, has the \ncapability of dynamic
    configuration of its finite state machines \n(FSMs) in the participating PCEMP
    peers, and thus can support a \nwide variety of traffic engineering techniques
    that are needed to \nguarantee bandwidth demand and scalable fast protection and
    \nrestoration in PCE based p2mp frameworks. To take advantage of \nbandwidth considerations
    and fast restoration mechanisms, the \ncentralized Controller, which is the key
    element in a PCE node, \nis used for path computation in case of p2mp paths and
    can be used \nin a scenario where reliable multicasting of bandwidth-on-demand
    \nservices becomes an important criteria for multiple-domain and/or \ninter-domain
    PCE based architectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
