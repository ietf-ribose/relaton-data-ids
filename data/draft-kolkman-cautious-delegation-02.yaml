abstract:
- content: "<p>NOTE: The authors recognize that the statistical models that would
    inform the process are not well understood and that the possibilities to game
    the system might be unmountable. Unless we reach more insights on how to deal
    with this details this work is abandoned. Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be
    in use in the wild even though it was never properly delegated. This situation
    appears particularly, but not only, true in certain domains near the root of the
    tree: people have independently used those non-existent top-level domains as private
    namespaces. If those names are to be delegated in the public DNS, prudence dictates
    that collisions between the private uses and the public use be minimized. We outline
    a procedure to evaluate the harm of delegation.</p>"
