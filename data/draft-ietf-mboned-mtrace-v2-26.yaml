abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named
    Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2). Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2 requires special
    implementations on the part of routers. This specification describes the required
    functionality in multicast routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a
    Query and receives a Reply.</p>"
