abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines an optional extension block, called aRetransmission
    Block (RB), that may be used with the Bundle Protocol[refs.DTNBP] within the context
    of a Delay-Tolerant Networkarchitecture [refs.DTNarch]. The Retransmission Block
    (RB) isdesigned to be used within a DTN that, as a matter of policy, deletesall
    replayed bundles from the network. It is designed to be used ina network that
    permits duplicate bundles to be forwarded if thosebundles have been retransmitted
    by a custodian, that may (ifpossible) permit duplicate bundles to be forwarded
    if those bundlesare in intentional or unintentional routing loops (contingent
    on theavailability of mechanisms to distinguish looping bundles from otherbundles),
    but that will consider all other duplicate bundles to bemaliciously replayed bundles
    and delete them as such. TheRetransmission Block is designed to be inserted into
    a bundle by acustodian when the custodian is retransmitting that bundle. Thepurpose
    of the RB is to mark the bundle as a custody-basedretransmission so that it can
    be distinguished from other types ofduplicate bundles and thereby be spared from
    deletion. This documentdefines the format and processing of this new Retransmission
    Block.</p>"
