abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers
    (SPs) need\n   to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as \"P-tunnels\") that
    enable\n   the Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast\n
    \  packets to each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a\n   hierarchical
    manner, with the PE routers in \"edge areas\", and the\n   edge areas connected
    to each other via a \"core area\". A P-tunnel that\n   connects PE routers in
    different edge areas can be thought of as\n   having three segments: a segment
    through one edge area, a segment\n   through the core area, and a segment through
    the second edge area.\n   It is desirable to preserve the independence of the
    core area by\n   allowing it to use a different tunneling technology than that
    used in\n   the edge areas.  However, it is not desirable for the core area\n
    \  Border Routers (BRs) to participate in the MVPN-specific signaling,\n   or
    even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas\n   that attach
    to it.  This document specifies a simple method for\n   segmenting MVPN P-tunnels
    at the BRs, subject to these constraints.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
