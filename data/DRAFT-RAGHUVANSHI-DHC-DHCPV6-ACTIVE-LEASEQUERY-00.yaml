abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has
    been\n   extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\n
    \  information about DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\n   queries
    for DHCPv6 binding data updates until the time DHCPv6 server\n   receive the Leasequery
    request.  Continuous update of an external\n   client with Leasequery data is
    sometimes desired.  This document\n   expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol,
    and allows for active\n   transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding information data
    via TCP.  This\n   document also extends DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery by adding new
    options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
