abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a generic simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of negotiation aspects eliminated,
    and to allow full and partial reachability validations. For MPLS based BFD, extensions
    to the generic mechanism are defined for BFD to perform a level of label verifications.</p>"
