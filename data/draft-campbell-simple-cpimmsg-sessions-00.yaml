abstract:
  content: "<p>Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages betweenusers
    in near real-time. These messages are usually, but notrequired to be, short. IMs
    are often used in a conversational mode,that is, the transfer of messages back
    and forth is fast enough forparticipants to maintain an interactive conversation.
    Each messagecan be sent independently using the SIP MESSAGE method, or messagescan
    be associated into sessions that are initiated using SIP. Thefirst approach is
    often referred to as pager-mode messaging, due toits similarity to the behavior
    of two way pager devices. The secondapproach is often called session-mode messaging,
    or simply messagesessions. This document describes a message session mechanism
    basedon the Common Presence and Instant Messaging message format.</p>"
