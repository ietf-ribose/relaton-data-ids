abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a public WLAN hotspot, we need to have an easy and secure
    way to\n   authenticate users. We have to find also mobility solutions, given
    \n   by providers, to perform well the roaming. A roaming mobile terminal\n   MT
    may be within radio range of more than one access point AP.\n   Therefore, we
    need to make an intelligent network selection decision\n   after receiving some
    roaming information. Currently, the information\n   is typically provisioned on
    the MTs as static roaming tables. But,\n   this approach is not scalable when
    there is a large number of access\n   points.\n\n   In this draft, we propose
    our solution called OSFR, Optimized Network\n   Selection for Fast Roaming to
    improve association speed and\n   scalability. \n\t </p>\n      "
