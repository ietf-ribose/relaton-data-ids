abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Discovery of endpoints and resources in M2M applications over
    large\n   networks is enabled by Resource Directories, but no special\n   consideration
    has been given to how such directories can scale beyond\n   what can be managed
    by a single device.\n\n   This document explores different ways in which Resource
    Directories\n   can be scaled up from single network to enterprise and global
    scale.\n   It does not attempt to standardize any of those methods, but only to\n
    \  demonstrate the feasibility of such extensions and to provide\n   terminology
    and exploratory groundwork for later documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
