abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for optional flow control credit scaling
    and link quality metric scaling for Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE). Credit
    and metric scaling is required when connecting to high performance devices that
    employ the PPPoE credit flow control and link metric reports as defined in RFC
    4938.</p>"
