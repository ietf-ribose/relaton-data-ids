abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control
    allows\n   each network element (NE) to perform resource discovery, routing and\n
    \  signaling in a distributed manner. On the other hand, with the\n   development
    of software-defined transport networking technology,\n   central controllers are
    introduced to transport networks to control\n   a set of NEs.\n\n   In transport
    networks, the GMPLS control has many mature mechanisms\n   such as RSVP-TE, OSPF-TE,
    and LMP, so that GMPLS can be applied for\n   the NE-level control in the centralized
    controller systems.\n\n   This document describes how GMPLS control interworks
    with\n   centralized controller systems (e.g. ACTN) in transport network.\n\n\t
