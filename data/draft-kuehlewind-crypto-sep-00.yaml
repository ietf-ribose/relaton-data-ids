abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the increasing deployment of session resumption mechanisms
    where cryptographic context can be resumed to transmit application data with the
    first packet without delay for connection setup and negotiation, this draft proposes
    a split to separate connections used to set up encryption context and negotiate
    capabilities from connections used to transmit application data. While cryptographic
    context and endpoint capabilities need to be be known before encrypted application
    data can be sent, there is otherwise no technical constraint that the crypto handshake
    has to be performed on the same transport connection. This document discusses
    requirements on the cryptographic protocol to establish medium- to long-lived
    association that can be used by different transport protocols that implement different
    transport services.</p>"
