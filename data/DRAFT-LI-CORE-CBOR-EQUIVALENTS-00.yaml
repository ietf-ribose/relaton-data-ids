abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based data format which is popular
    for Web\n   based data exchanges.  CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which\n
    \  has been optimized for data exchanges for the Internet of Things.\n   For many
    IoT scenarios, CBOR formats will be preferred since it can\n   decrease transmission
    payload sizes compared to other data formats.\n\n   This specification defines
    an approach for translating JSON objects,\n   which are relevant for the CoRE
    WG and its related specifications,\n   into CBOR format.  Where applicable, mapping
    from other formats into\n   JSON or CBOR is also described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
