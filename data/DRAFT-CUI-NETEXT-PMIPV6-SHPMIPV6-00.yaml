abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provide
    a mobile\n   node(MN) which requires no additional modification to MN with IP\n
    \  mobility.  Fast Handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FHPMIPv6), specified\n   in[RFC5949],
    proposed two modes of fast handover, both of them use\n   single interface to
    transmate packets during handover, which requires\n   it to buffer packets in
    MAGs when interface performs handover.\n   Buffer packets in MAGs result in additional
    overhead, and increase\n   packets transmission delay.  Unlike FHPMIPv6, this
    document proposed\n   a seamless handover scheme for multi-access mobile node
    with IP\n   mobility when one of MN's network interface performs handover from\n
    \  one MAG to another.  This scheme uses some other interface of the\n   multi-access
    mobile node to help process packets while handovering.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
