abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain Names can be Qualified or Unqualified Domain Names.
    \ Qualified\n   Domain Names are resolved over the public DNS infrastructure,
    whereas\n   Unqualified Domain Names are resolved using search lists.  How search\n
    \  lists are generated and interpreted varies from one application to\n   another
    and from one operating system to another.  This makes\n   Unqualified Domain Name
    resolution unpredictable, non deterministic,\n   and as such neither reliable
    nor stable.\n\n   In addition, there is neither clear rules to define whether
    a name is\n   a Qualified or an Unqualified Domain Name.  This also contributes
    in\n   making the naming resolution unreliable, as the resolution of a given\n
    \  name can result in different responses.\n\n   As a consequence, most resolution
    systems currently end with a \"try\n   and error\" strategy.  More specifically,
    according to some system\n   dependent heuristics, a resolver initiates an Unqualified
    (resp.\n   Qualified) Domain Name resolution, and, in case of a NXDOMAIN\n   response,
    fails back in a Qualified (resp. Unqualified) Domain Name\n   resolution.  Such
    strategies were acceptable as the probability of\n   collision between domains
    within search list and those published in\n   the public DNS infrastructure remains
    low.  In the context of the\n   generalization of Top Level Domain, this assumption
    is not acceptable\n   anymore, resulting in an unreliable and unstable naming
    resolution.\n\n   This document describes how search list should be generated
    and\n   interpreted.  Then, it describes how resolvers distinguish between\n   Qualified
    and Unqualified Domain Names as well as how to resolve\n   them.\n\n\t </p>\n
