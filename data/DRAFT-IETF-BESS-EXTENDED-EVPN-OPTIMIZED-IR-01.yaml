abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [EVPN-AR] specifies an optimized ingress replication solution
    for\n   more efficient multicast and broadcast delivery in a Network\n   Virtualization
    Overlay (NVO) network for EVPN.\n\n   This document extends the optimized ingress
    replication procedures\n   specified in [EVPN-AR] to overcome the limitation that
    an AR-\n   REPLICATOR may have.  An AR-REPLICATOR may be unable to retain the\n
    \  source IP address or include the expected ESI label that is required\n   for
    EVPN split horizon filtering when replicating the packet on\n   behalf of its
    multihomed AR-LEAF.  Under this circumstance, the\n   extended procedures specified
    in this document allows the support of\n   EVPN multihoming on the AR-LEAFs as
    well as optimized ingress\n   replication for the rest of the EVPN overlay network.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
