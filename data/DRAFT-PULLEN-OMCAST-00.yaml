abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines formats and procedures for middleware that\noperates
    at the application layer to provide for transmission of \nIP multicast over IP
    networks that do not have network layer\nmulticasting enabled, by means of tunneling
    IP multicast over IP\nunicast. This capability is called overlay multicast (OMCAST).
    While \nit cannot be as efficient as network layer multicasting, OMCAST\nallows
    for transparent support of IP multicast applications. \nBecause the relay agents
    can cooperate to forward multicast messages \nin a way modeled after network layer
    multicast trees, significant \nreductions in network traffic are possible as compared
    to parallel \ntransmission by each host to all other participating hosts. However,
    \nthis protocol only provides mechanisms for the agents to cooperate; \nit does
    not prescribe a mechanism for routing messages among the \nagents.\n\n\t </p>\n
