abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    energy management. The requirements defined in this document concern monitoring
    functions as well as control functions. Monitoring functions include identification
    of energy-managed devices and their components, monitoring of their power states,
    power inlets, power outlets, actual power (the instantaneous power, as opposed
    to the demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes, received energy,
    provided energy, and contained batteries. Control functions serve for controlling
    power supply and power state of energy-managed devices and their components. This
    document does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations
    but rather features that must be supported by standards for energy management.</p>"
