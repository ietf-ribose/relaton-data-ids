abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DiffServ mechanisms have been developed to support Quality
    of Service\n   (QoS).  However, the level of assurance that can be provided with\n
    \  DiffServ without substantial over-provisioning is limited.  Pre-\n   Congestion
    Notification (PCN) investigates the use of per-flow\n   admission control to provide
    the required service guarantees for the\n\n   admitted traffic.  While admission
    control will protect the QoS under\n   normal operating conditions, an additional
    flow pre-emption mechanism\n   is necessary in the times of heavy congestion (e.g.
    caused by route\n   changes due to link or node failure).\n\n   This document
    provides a problem statement on the addition of flow\n   admission control and
    flow pre-emption functionality to a DiffServ\n   network, in particular for the
    support of real time services such as\n   voice and video.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
