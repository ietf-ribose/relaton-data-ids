abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks like financial information network (stock/\n
    \  commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications,\n   Latency
    (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is\n   becoming a key requirement
    for path computation along with other\n   constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation
    and Packet Loss\n   is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between\n
    \  customers and service providers.\n\n   [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture
    to allow latency, loss\n   and jittering as properties.  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and
    [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS]\n   describes mechanisms with which network performance information
    is\n   distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectivily.  This document describes\n
    \  the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as\n   constraints
    for end to end path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
