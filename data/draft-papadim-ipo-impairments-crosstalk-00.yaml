abstract:
  content: "<p>Optical in-band crosstalk between interfering optical channels hasbeen
    identified (see [ITC-DIL]) as one of the major limitations tothe diameter and
    the performance of photonic (or all-optical)networks. In this context in-band
    crosstalk remains a cause ofoptical signal degradation in switching elements included
    in aPhotonic Cross-Connect (PXC).</p>"
