abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
    increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of devices. Operators begining
    to seek more information of power consumption in the network, have no standard
    mechanism to measure, report and compare power usage of different networking equipment
    under different network configuration and conditions exist. This document provides
    suggestions for measuring power usage of live networks under different traffic
    loads and various switch router configuration settings. It provides a suite which
    can be deployed on any networking device .</p>"
