abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes the Universal Packet Driver Protocol
    (UPDP). This protocol is intended to provide a standardized method for a device
    to communicate its interface information. It is a protocol based on extending
    ICMP [1] within the bounds of the original intention of ICMP. The protocol can
    be used by any device to send and receive device interface information.</p>"
