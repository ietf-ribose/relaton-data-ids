abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for using UDP/IP for the
    \n   transport of Media Independent Handover (MIH) messages between \n   network
    nodes. MIH messages carry technology specific link layer \n   information and
    commands that can be used to optimize handover \n   procedures across different
    access technologies such as cellular and \n   WLAN. MIH will complement Layer
    3 mobility protocols such as Mobile \n   IP.  \n\t </p>\n      "
