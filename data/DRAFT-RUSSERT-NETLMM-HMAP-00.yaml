abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) for Network Localized Mobility\n
    \  Management (NETLMM) is a single point of failure for the Localized\n   Mobility
    Management Domain (LMMD) and a focal point for all mobile\n   node (MN) traffic.
    \ These shortcomings can be addressed by\n   distributing the MAP function equally
    among the Access Routers (ARs)\n   in the LMMD and deploying hierarchically organized
    supporting nodes\n   in the backhaul network.  This document specifies a Hierarchical
    MAP\n   (HMAP) and its use in operational delployments that support traffic\n
    \  distribution and fault tolerance.  Solutions for both IPv4 and IPv6\n   are
    given.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
