abstract:
- content: "<p>The maximum Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) payload size is
    limited to 64KB. This makes IKEv2 not usable for conservative post- quantum cryptosystem
    whose public-key is larger than 64KB. This document discusses the considerations
    and defines a mechanism to exchange large post-quantum public keys and signatures
    in IKEv2.</p>"
