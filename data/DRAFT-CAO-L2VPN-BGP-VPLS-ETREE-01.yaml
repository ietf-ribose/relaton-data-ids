abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum\n(MEF)
    Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service using\nBGP for auto-discovery
    and signaling [RFC4761]. The proposed solution\nis characterized by breaking pseudowire
    between Leafs to fulfill the\nspecific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate
    with Leaf.\nBackward compatibility is also considered.\n\t </p>\n      "
