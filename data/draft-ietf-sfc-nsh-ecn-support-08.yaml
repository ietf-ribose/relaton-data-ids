abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding element
    to notify downstream devices of the onset of congestion without having to drop
    packets. Coupled with a means to feed information about congestion back to upstream
    nodes, this can improve network efficiency through better congestion control,
    frequently without packet drops. This document specifies ECN and congestion feedback
    support within a Service Function Chaining (SFC) domain through use of the Network
    Service Header (NSH, RFC 8300) and IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX, RFC 7011).</p>"
