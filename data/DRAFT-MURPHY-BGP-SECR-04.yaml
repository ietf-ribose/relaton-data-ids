abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed
    before\nthe Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little\nconsideration
    for protection of the information it carries.  There are\nno mechanisms in BGP
    to protect against attacks that modify, delete,\nforge, or replay data, any of
    which has the potential to disrupt overall\nnetwork routing behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n
