  content: "\n\t <p>   The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) [WEBRTC] working group
    is\n   charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich\n   communication
    using audio, video and data between two peers' web\n   browsers.  With in the
    WebRTC framework, Session Description protocol\n   (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for
    negotiating session capabilities between\n   the peers.  Such a negotiation happens
    based on the SDP Offer/Answer\n   exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264
    [RFC3264].\n\n   This documents provides an informational reference in describing
    the\n   role of SDP and Offer/Answer exchange for the most common WebRTC use-\n
    \  cases.\n\n   This SDP examples provided in this document is still a work in\n
    \  progress, but it aims to align closest to the evolving standards\n   work.\n\n\t
