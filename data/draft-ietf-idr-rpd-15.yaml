abstract:
- content: "<p>It is hard to adjust traffic and optimize traffic paths in a traditional
    IP network from time to time through manual configurations. It is desirable to
    have a mechanism for setting up routing policies, which adjusts traffic and optimizes
    traffic paths automatically. This document describes BGP Extensions for Routing
    Policy Distribution (BGP RPD) to support this.</p>"
