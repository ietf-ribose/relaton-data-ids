abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience with the \"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\n
    \  (6to4)\" IPv6 transitioning mechanism has shown that the mechanism is\n   unsuitable
    for widespread deployment and use in the Internet.  This\n   document requests
    that RFC3056 and the companion document \"An Anycast\n   Prefix for 6to4 Relay
    Routers\" RFC3068 are made obsolete and moved to\n   historic status.\n\n\t </p>\n
