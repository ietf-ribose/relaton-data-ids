abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to the significant concepts and research challenges\n
    \  described in RFC7927, we think that the multi-service tag technology\n   is
    a effective name mechanism for video contents in ICN. Because the\n   video traffic
    is the primary traffic transferred in the Internet, it\n   will tremendously promote
    the current Internet architecture to the\n   ICN architecture that the name mechanism
    for the video contents is\n   established. This document discusses the consideration
    for the design\n   of multi-service tag in ICN and how to use the multi-service
    tag\n   technology to establish the name mechanism for the video contents.\n   This
    document also gives the typical cases which use the above name\n   mechanism to
    improve the content distribution efficiency and cache\n   system efficiency.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
