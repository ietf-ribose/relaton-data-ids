abstract:
- content: "<p>mDNS combined with Service Discovery (DNS-SD) extends network resource
    distribution beyond the reach of multicast normally limited by the MAC Bridge.
    Since related resources are often not authenticated, either local resources are
    inherently trustworthy or are subsequently verified by associated services. Resource
    distribution becomes complex when a hybrid scheme combines adjacent network resources
    into a common unicast DNS-SD structure. This document explores related security
    considerations.</p>"
