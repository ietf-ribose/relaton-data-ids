abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism to construct Label Switched
    Paths \n(LSP) over MPLS using an extended version of the Label Distribution \nProtocol
    (LDP) between a set of clients and servers. This \ncommunication mechanism has
    the capability that servers can \ncommunicate with other servers and clients,
    whereas clients can only \ncommunicate with servers but not with other clients.
    \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC-2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
