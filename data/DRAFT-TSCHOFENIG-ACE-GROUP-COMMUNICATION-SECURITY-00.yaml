abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some Internet of Things application domains require secure
    group\n   communication.  This draft describes procedures for authorization,\n
    \  key management, and securing group messages.  We specify the usage of\n   object
    security at the application layer for group communication and\n   assume that
    CoAP is used as the application layer protocol.  The\n   architecture allows the
    usage of symmetric and asymmetric keys to\n   secure the group messages.  The
    asymmetric key solution provides the\n   ability to uniquely authenticate the
    source of all group messages and\n   this is the recommended architecture for
    most applications.  However,\n   some applications have strict requirements on
    latency for group\n   communication (e.g. in non-emergency lighting applications)
    and it\n   may not always be feasible to use the secure source authenticated\n
    \  architecture.  In such applications we recommend the use of\n   dynamically
    generated symmetric group keys to secure group\n   communications.\n\n\t </p>\n
