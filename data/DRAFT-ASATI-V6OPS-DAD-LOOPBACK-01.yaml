abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is a common practice to install a (soft or hard) loopback
    on a\n   circuit interface for various purposes (e.g. circuit turn-up test).\n
    \  However, this practice results in disabling IPv6 on an interface\n   even after
    the loopback is removed, due to the way IPv6 duplicate\n   address detection is
    performed.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal
    after\n   such a loopback is placed &amp; removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
