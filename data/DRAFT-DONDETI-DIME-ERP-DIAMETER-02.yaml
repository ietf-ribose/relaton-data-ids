    has\nbeen specified that supports an EAP method-independent protocol for\nefficient
    re-authentication between the peer and the server through\nan authenticator.  This
    document specifies Diameter support for ERP.\nThe Diameter EAP application is
    re-used for encapsulating the newly\ndefined EAP Initiate and EAP Finish messages
    specified in the ERP\nspecification.  AVPs for request and delivery of Domain
    Specific Root\nKeys from the AAA/EAP server to the ER server are also specified.\nAdditionally,
