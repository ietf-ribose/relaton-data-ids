abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n
    \  pervasive for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center
    (DC) applications and as the next generation virtual private\n   LAN services
    in service provider (SP) applications.\n\n   The use of host IP default route
    and host unknown MAC route within a\n   DC is well understood in order to ensure
    that leaf nodes within a DC\n   only learn and store host MAC and IP addresses
    for that DC.  All\n   other host MAC and IP addresses from remote DCs are learned
    and\n   stored in DC GW nodes thus alleviating leaf nodes from learning host\n
    \  MAC and IP addresses from the remote DCs.\n\n   This draft further optimizes
    the MAC and IP address learning at the\n   leaf nodes such that a leaf node within
    a DC only needs to learn and\n   store MAC and IP addresses associated with the
    sites directly\n   connected to it.  A leaf node does not need to learn and store
    MAC\n   and IP addresses from any other leaf nodes thus reducing the number\n
    \  of learned MACs and IP addresses per EVI substantially.\n\n   The modifications
    provided by this draft updates and extends RFC7024\n   for BGP EVPN Address Family.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
