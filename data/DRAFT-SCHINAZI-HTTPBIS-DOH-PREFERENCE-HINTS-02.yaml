abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When using a publicly available DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server,
    some\n   clients may suffer poor performance when the authoritative DNS server\n
    \  is located far from the DoH server.  For example, a publicly\n   available
    DoH server provided by a Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n   should be able to
    resolve names hosted by that CDN with good\n   performance but might take longer
    to resolve names provided by other\n   CDNs, or might provide suboptimal results
    if that CDN is using DNS-\n   based load balancing and returns different address
    records depending\n   or where the DNS query originated from.  This document attempts
    to\n   lessen these issues by allowing the web server to indicate to the\n   client
    which DoH server can best resolve its addresses.  This\n   document defines an
    HTTP header field that enables web host operators\n   to inform user agents of
    the preferred DoH servers to use for\n   subsequent DNS lookups for the host's
    domain.\n\n   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the ADD IETF\n
    \  mailing list add@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains\n   the
    draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft-httpbis-doh-\n   preference-hints.\n\n\t
