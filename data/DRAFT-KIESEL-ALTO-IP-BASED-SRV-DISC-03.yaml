abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.\n\n   This document establishes a well-known
    IP address for the ALTO\n   service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in
    the resource\n   consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.\n\nTerminology
    and Requirements Language\n\n   This document makes use of the ALTO terminology
    defined in RFC 5693\n   [RFC5693].\n\t </p>\n      "
