abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance\nin
    networking devices.  Terms are included for test components, test\nsetup parameters,
    and performance benchmark metrics for black-box\nbenchmarking of SIP networking
    devices.  The performance benchmark\nmetrics are obtained for the SIP control
    plane and media plane.  The\nterms are intended for use in a companion methodology
    document for\ncomplete performance characterization of a device in a variety of\nconditions
    making it possible to compare performance of different\ndevices.  It is critical
    to provide test setup parameters and a\nmethodology document for SIP performance
    benchmarking because SIP\nallows a wide range of configuration and operational
    conditions that\ncan influence performance benchmark measurements.  It is necessary
    to\nhave terminology and methodology standards to ensure that reported\nbenchmarks
    have consistent definition and were obtained following the\nsame procedures.  Benchmarks
    can be applied to compare performance of\na variety of SIP networking devices.\n\t
