abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Instead of forwarding to a specific device or to all devices
    in a\n   group, anycast addresses, let network devices forward a packet to (or\n
    \  steer it through) one or more topologically nearest devices in a\n   specific
    group of network devices.  The use of anycast addresses has\n   been extended
    to the Segment Routing (SR) network, wherein a group of\n   SR-capable devices
    can represent a anycast address, by having the\n   same Segment Routing Global
    Block (SRGB) provisioned on all the\n   devices and each one of them advertising
    the same anycast prefix\n   segment (or Anycast SID).\n\n   This document describes
    a proposal for implementing anycast prefix\n   segments in a MPLS-based SR network,
    without the need to have the\n   same SRGB block (label ranges) provisioned across
    all the member\n   devices in the group.  Each node can be provisioned with a
    separate\n   SRGB from the label range supported by the specfic hardware platform.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
