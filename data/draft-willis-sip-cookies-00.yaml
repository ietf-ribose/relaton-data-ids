abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to SIP (RFC 2543) to provide a
    mechanism for storing state and other information in SIP comparable to the HTTP
    state mechanisms defined in RFC 2109. This extension includes a new SIP header
    ('Cookie:'), an option tag for feature negotiation ('cookie') and IANA registration
    considerations for registering the 'cookie' extension, semantics of the value
    of the Cookie: header, and behavioral rules for processing these headers by SIP
    nodes supporting the 'cookie' extension. This document also briefly discusses
    possible uses of cookies, and security considerations for their use.</p>"
