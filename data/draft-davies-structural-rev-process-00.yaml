abstract:
  content: "<p>This document suggests a possible process to address thestructural
    problems identified in the IETF Problem Statement asrequested in Version 02 of
    the IETF Problem Resolution draft.The process proposes that the IESG delegate
    responsibility forcoordinating, moderating and synthesising proposals for solutionsto
    parts of the structural problems to a Synthsis and Action Panel(SAP) selected
    through a variant of the nomcom selection process.The SAP should, if possible,
    deliver an integrated set ofproposals for changes derived from community input,
    bothunsolicited and, if necessary, solicited. The SAP would act as amoderator
    between authors of alternative propoasals in attemptingto achieve a proposal on
    which the community could agree. Theagreed plan be would be delivered to the IESG
    for final approval and action.</p>"
