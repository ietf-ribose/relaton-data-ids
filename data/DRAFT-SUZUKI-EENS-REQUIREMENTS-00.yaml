abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Requirements concerning an energy-efficient network system
    such as a\n   cloud system are presented.  Specifically, a large-scale cloud\n
    \  system, which is composed of multiple data centers (DCs) and a wide\n   area
    network (WAN) to connect these DCs, is focused on.  The problems\n   needed to
    be overcome in order to make the system energy efficient\n   are presented.  The
    requirements that must be satisfied in order to\n   solve these problems are also
    presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
