abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL uses distribution trees for multi-destination traffic.
    In fat\n   tree structure, it is very possible that the distance from an ingress\n
    \  RBridge to multiple tree roots are the same. Therefore the minimum\n   distance
    comparison may not help much in the tree selection decision.\n   Multiple trees
    can be used by an ingress RBridge. For any RBridge RBn,\n   if RBn has downstream
    receivers of VLAN x in a distribution tree t,\n   there will be an entry of (t,
    x, port list) in the multicast\n   forwarding table on RBn. If there are n trees
    and m VLANs, the\n   multicast forwarding table size on RBn is typically n*m entries.
    The\n   value of m is up to 4096 and n is up to the total number of\n   distribution
    trees in the campus. If finer granularity filtering such\n   as L2/L3 multicast
    address is used, then the multicast forwarding\n   table size further increases
    dramatically. TRILL multicast forwarding\n   table size is limited in hardware/silicon
    implements and sometimes L3\n   multicasting shares the same table with it. This
    document specifies a\n   VLAN based tree selection mechanism to reduce the multicast\n
    \  forwarding table size. No data plane change is required.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
