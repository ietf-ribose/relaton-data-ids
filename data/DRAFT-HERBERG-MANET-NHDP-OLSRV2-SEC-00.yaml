abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies integrity and replay protection for
    required\n   implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\n
    \  and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).\n   This
    document specifies how an integrity check value (ICV) and a\n   timestamp may
    be included as TLVs (defined in [RFC6622bis]) in NHDP's\n   and OLSRv2's control
    messages, countering a number of security\n   threats to NHDP and to OLSRv2.  The
    ICV TLV uses a SHA-256 based HMAC\n   and a single shared secret key.  The timestamp
    TLV is based on POSIX\n   time, assuming router synchronization.  The mechanism
    in this\n   specification can also be used for other MANET protocols using\n   RFC5444.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
