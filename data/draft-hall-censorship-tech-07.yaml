abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the technical mechanisms used by censorship
    regimes around the world to block or impair Internet traffic. It aims to make
    designers, implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware of the properties
    being exploited and mechanisms used to censor end-user access to information.
    This document makes no suggestions on individual protocol considerations, and
    is purely informational, intended to be a reference.</p>"
