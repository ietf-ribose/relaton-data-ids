abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a mechanism to specify an Segment Routing
    (SR) policy, as a collection of SR candidate paths. An SR policy is identified
    by &lt;headend, color, end-point&gt; tuple. An SR policy can contain one or more
    candidate paths where each candidate path is identified in PCEP via an PLSP-ID.
    This document proposes extension to PCEP to support association among candidate
    paths of a given SR policy. The mechanism proposed in this document is applicable
    to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes of SR.</p>"
