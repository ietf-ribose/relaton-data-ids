abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all
    hosts\nare upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6-\nonly,
    or that there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk to\nIPv4-only hosts.
    \ Expecting the former within a reasonable timeframe\nisn't realistic, based on
    current adoption of dual stack combined\nwith the latest projections for the IPv4
    depletion that point to a\ndate early in the next decade.  And the IETF has recently
    deprecated\nthe main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT.\nThis document
    proposes modifications to NAT-PT that address the\nreasons why the mechanism was
    deprecated.  This should allow future\ndeployment of the modified NAT-PT as an
    IPv4-to-IPv6 transition\nmechanism, giving operators the option of running their
    networks\nlargely IPv6-only.\n\t </p>\n      "
