abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to compute and provide optimal paths, a Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Traditionally,
    this TED has been obtained from a link state (LS) routing protocol supporting
    the traffic engineering extensions. This document extends the Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) with Link-State and TE Information as an
    experimental extension.</p>"
