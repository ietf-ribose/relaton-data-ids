abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation
    by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2, the related
    Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) version 2, and the HTTP Transfer for
    the Certificate Management Protocol. It specifies a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing
    on typical use cases relevant for managing certificates of devices in many industrial
    and IoT scenarios. To limit the overhead of certificate management for more constrained
    devices only the most crucial types of operations are specified as mandatory.
    To foster interoperability in more complex scenarios, other types of operations
    are specified as recommended or optional.</p>"
