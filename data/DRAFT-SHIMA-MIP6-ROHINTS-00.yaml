abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the distribution mechanism of route optimization\nhints,
    which can be used by a mobile node to determine when the node\nshould initiate
    the route optimization procedure when communicating\nwith correspondent nodes.
    \ Usually, a mobile node will perform RO\nprocedure to any correspondent node
    as described in Mobile IPv6\nspecification [1].  However, in some cases, it is
    better not to\nperform RO.  A typical example is a firewalled network.  This memo\nalso
    describes a configuration of a firewall which makes mobile nodes\npossible to
    move between an intranet and the Internet by using RO\nhints.\n\t </p>\n      "
