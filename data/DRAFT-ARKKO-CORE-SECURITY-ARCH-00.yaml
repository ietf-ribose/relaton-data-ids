abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight protocol\n
    \  designed to be used in machine-to-machine applications.  This memo\n   describes
    challenges associated with securing CoAP and proposes a new\n   security model
    that the authors believe is suitable for these\n   environments.  The model requires
    minimal amount of configuration,\n   but still provides strong security and is
    a natural fit with the\n   typical communication practices smart object networking
    environments.\n   This memo also proposes JSON payload format extensions to support
    the\n   architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
