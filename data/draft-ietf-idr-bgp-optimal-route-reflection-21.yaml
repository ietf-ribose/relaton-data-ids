abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors. On route
    reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the best path for
    their clients standpoint, rather than from the route reflectors standpoint. Multiple
    type of granularity are proposed, from a per client BGP route selection or to
    a per peer group, depending on the scaling and precision requirements on route
    selection. This solution is particularly applicable in deployments using centralized
    route reflectors, where choosing the best route based on the Route Reflector IGP
    location is suboptimal. This facilitates, for example, best exit point policy
    (hot potato routing). The solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all
    paths which are eligible for consideration. Best path selection is performed in
    each route reflector based on the IGP cost from a selected location in the link
    state IGP.</p>"
