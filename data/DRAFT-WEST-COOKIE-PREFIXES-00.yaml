abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6265 by adding a set of restrictions
    upon\n   the names which may be used for cookies with specific properties.\n   These
    restrictions enable user agents to smuggle cookie state to the\n   server within
    the confines of the existing \"Cookie\" request header\n   syntax, and limits
    the ways in which cookies may be abused in a\n   conforming user agent.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
