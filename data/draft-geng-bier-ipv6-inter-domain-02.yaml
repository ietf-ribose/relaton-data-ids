abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication IPv6 encapsulation (BIERv6) introduces
    an approach to use IPv6 extension header to carry BIER header with IPv6 unicast
    address as destination address. It provides the ability to replicate a packet
    from one router to other routers in a different domain as well as routers in the
    same domain. This document introduces the techniques for multicast deployment
    across multiple domains using BIERv6, and demonstrate how BIERv6 is beneficial
    for such deployment.</p>"
