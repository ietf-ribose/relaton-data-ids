abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC3961 to support encryption mechanisms
    that\n   can authenticate associated data, such as Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)\n
    \  and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).  These mechanisms are often more\n   performant
    and need not expand the message as much as conventional\n   modes.\n\n\t </p>\n
