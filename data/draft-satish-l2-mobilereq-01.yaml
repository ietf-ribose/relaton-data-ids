abstract:
  content: "<p>IP mobility protocols have traditionally been designed to beindependent
    of any L2 considerations. A critical factor in achievinggood performance for IP
    mobility protocols is its closeness to an L2handover. Handover occurs when a Mobile
    Node moves from one radioaccess Point to another. If the new radio access point
    is associatedwith a new subnet, the routing reachability change will have to reflectat
    the access routers. Better synchronization between L2 handover andL3 handover
    are still more important when supporting fast handoffbetween two wireless domains.
    This draft discusses the L2 handoversteps and the possible coupling of L2 and
    L3 layers to support optimizelayer 3 handover. This draft also explores the location
    information asa possible L2 trigger to support optimized L3 handover. Also an
    L2trigger message format is defined which can be handled at L3independent of other
    protocol considerations.</p>"
