abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although several contemporary IT devices have multiple network\n
    \  interfaces, communication sessions are restricted to use only one of\n   them
    at a time due to the design of the TCP/IP protocol stack: the\n   communication
    endpoint is identified by an IP address and a TCP or\n   UDP port number. The
    simultaneous use of these multiple interfaces\n   for a communication session
    would improve user experience through\n   higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failures.\n\n   MPT is a network layer multipath solution, which provides
    a tunnel\n   over multiple paths using the GRE-in-UDP specification, thus being\n
    \  different from both MPTCP and Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding Protocol.\n\n   MPT
    can also be used as a router, routing the packets among several\n   networks between
    the tunnel endpoints, thus establishing a multipath\n   site-to-site connection.\n\n
    \  The version of tunnel IP and the version of path IP are independent\n   from
    each other, therefore MPT can also be used for IPv6 transition\n   purposes.\n\n\t
