abstract:
  content: "<p>When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 addressdepletion,
    DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of theproblems. However, it is
    troublesome for an ISP to have the existingIPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite
    facilities at the same time fornot a short period of time. This document proposes
    a mechanism toassign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which makes
    everycustomer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP tomaintain
    single facility of the service network.</p>"
