abstract:
- content: <p>BIER is a multicast forwarding architecture that does not require per-flow
    state inside the network yet still provides optimal replication. This document
    describes how the existing BIER encapsulation specified in RFC 8296 works in a
    non-MPLS IPv6 network, which is referred to as BIERin6. Specifically, like in
    an IPv4 network, BIER can work over L2 links directly or over tunnels. In case
    of IPv6 tunneling, a new IP "Next Header" type is to be assigned for BIER.</p>
