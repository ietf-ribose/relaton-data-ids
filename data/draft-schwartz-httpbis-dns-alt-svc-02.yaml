abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) mechanism allows an HTTP origin
    to be served from multiple network endpoints, and over multiple protocols. However,
    the client must first contact the origin server, in order to learn of the alternative
    services. This draft proposes a straightforward mapping of Alt-Svc into DNS, allowing
    clients to learn of these services before their first contact with the origin.
    This arrangement offers potential benefits to both performance and privacy.</p>"
