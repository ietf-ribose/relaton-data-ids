abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides applicability, use case studies and network
    design considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport profile (MPLS-TP).
    In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice for the new
    generation of packet transport. Many service providers (SPs) are working to replace
    the legacy transport technologies, e.g. SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM technologies,
    with MPLS-TP for packet transport, in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower
    operational cost, while maintaining transport characteristics. The use cases for
    MPLS-TP include Metro Ethernet access and aggregation, Mobile backhaul, and packet
    optical transport. The design considerations discussed in this documents ranging
    from operational experience; standards compliance; technology maturity; end-to-end
    forwarding and OAM consistency; compatibility with IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor
    interoperability; and optimization vs. simplicity design trade off discussion.
    The general design principle is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable
    transport solutions.</p>"
