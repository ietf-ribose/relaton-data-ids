abstract:
- content: "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic, particularly
    during the introduction of the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.
    The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss Network Impacts
    of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The workshop was held to convene interested
    researchers, network operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
    to share their experiences. The meeting was held online given the on-going travel
    and contact restrictions at that time.</p>"
