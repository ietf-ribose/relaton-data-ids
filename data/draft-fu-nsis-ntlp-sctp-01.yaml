abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currentlyuses
    TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation. Thisdocument describes the
    usage of GIST over the Stream ControlTransmission Protocol (SCTP). The use of
    SCTP can take the advantageof features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based
    transport,support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and thesupport
    of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.Additionally, the support
    for some extensions of SCTP is alsodiscussed, namely its Partial Reliability Extension
    and the usage ofTLS over SCTP.</p>"
