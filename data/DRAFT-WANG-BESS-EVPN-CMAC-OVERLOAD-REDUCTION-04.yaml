abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When PBB EVPN [RFC7623] is used in Segment Routing networks,
    it is\n   complicated to make use of the SID list to carry a function that is\n
    \  aiming for C-MACs.\n\n   In [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], End.DX2
    function is\n   defined, this function can be used in EVPN VPLS.  When it is used
    in\n   EVPN VPLS, the data-plane learning defined in End.DT2U function can\n   also
    be activated for End.DX2 function.  On the basis of such End.DX2\n   function,
    SRv6 EVPN can meet all the requirements per [RFC7623] and\n   bring us some other
    benefits.  Such SRv6 EVPN is called light-\n   weighted SRv6 EVPN, and it will
    be more simpler than PBB EVPN over\n   SRv6.\n\n   It is easy for the light-weighted
    SRv6 EVPN to carry a SID that is\n   aiming for customer ethernet packets, because
    there will be no other\n   ethernet header between the SID list and the customer
    ethernet\n   header.  These SIDs may be user-defined functions for the customer\n
    \  ethernet headers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
