abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Public-key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised,\n
    \  that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an attacker.\n   However
    the revocation process is often unreliable.  An alternative\n   to revocation
    is issuing a sequence of certificates, each with a\n   short validity period,
    and terminating this sequence upon compromise.\n   This memo proposes an ACME
    extension to enable the issuance of short-\n   term and automatically renewed
    (STAR) certificates.\n\n   [RFC Editor: please remove before publication]\n\n
    \  While the draft is being developed, the editor's version can be found\n   at
    https://github.com/yaronf/I-D/tree/master/STAR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
