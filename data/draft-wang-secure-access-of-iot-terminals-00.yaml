abstract:
- content: "<p>It is difficult to supervise the great deal of Internet of Things (IoT)
    smart terminals which are widely distributed. Furthermore, a large number of smart
    terminals (such as IP cameras, access control terminals, traffic cameras, etc.)
    running on the network have high security risks in access control. This draft
    introduces the technical requirements for access management and control of IoT
    smart terminals, which is used to solve the problem of personate and illegal connection
    in the access process, and enables users to strengthen the control of devices
    and discover devices that is offline in time, so as to ensure the safety and stability
    of smart terminals in the access process.</p>"
