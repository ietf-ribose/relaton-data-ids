abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would\n   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and\n
    \  GMPLS while removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols\n   such
    as LDP and RSVP-TE.  In\n   [I-D.draft-zhao-pce-central-controller-user-cases],
    we propose to use\n   the PCE as a central controller so that LSP can be calculated/\n
    \  signaled/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded\n   through
    a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the\n   LSP path while
    leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as\n   possible.\n\n   This draft
    specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for\n   using the PCE as the
    central controller and user cases where LSPs are\n   calculated/setup/initiated
    and label forwarding entries are\n   downloaded through extending the existing
    PCE architectures and PCEP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
