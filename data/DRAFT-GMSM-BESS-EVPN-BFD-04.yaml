abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies proactive, in-band network OAM mechanisms
    to\n   detect loss of continuity and miss-connection faults that affect\n   unicast
    and multi-destination paths (used by Broadcast, Unknown\n   Unicast and Multicast
    traffic) in an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) network.\n   The mechanisms specified in the
    draft are based on the widely adopted\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
    protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
