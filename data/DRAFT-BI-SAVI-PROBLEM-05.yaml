abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working
    group is\n   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from
    the\n   end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address\n
    \  of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires\n   the
    edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI\n   will need
    a long time.  During this transition period, some source\n   address validation
    techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be\n   needed to complement SAVI
    and protect the networks from spoofing\n   based attacks.  In this document, we
    first propose three desired\n   features of the SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze
    the problems of\n   the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.  Finally,
    we\n   discuss the directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.\n\n\t </p>\n
