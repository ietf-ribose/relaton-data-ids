abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This description addresses the method for using internationalized
    \n(multilingual) domain names under the current DNS. Further, the method \nfor
    converting a internationalized domain name expressed in a native \nlanguage, into
    a traditional US-ASCII domain name compatible in current \nDNS, is addressed.\n\nThis
    method especially uses 'sequence of 36 characters' to convert all\ncharacters
    in IDN into US-ASCII. \n\nFinally, the way to use this method with lc2LDs are
    presented.\n\t </p>\n      "
