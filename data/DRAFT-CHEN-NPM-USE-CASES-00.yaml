abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks continue to scale, we need a coordinated effort
    for\n   diagnosing control plane health issues in heterogeneous environments.\n
    \  Traditionally, operators developed internal solutions to address the\n   identification
    and remediation of control plane health issues, but as\n   networks increase in
    size, speed and dynamicity, new methods and\n   techniques will be required.\n\n
    \  This document highlights key network health issues, as well as\n   network
    planning requirements, identified by leading network\n   operators.  It also provides
    an overview of current art and\n   techniques that are used, but highlights key
    deficiencies and areas\n   for improvement.\n\n   This document proposes a unified
    management framework for\n   coordinating diagnostics of control plane problems
    and optimization\n   of network design.  Furthermore, it outlines requirements
    for\n   collecting, storing and analyzing control plane data, to minimise or\n
    \  negate control plane problems that may significantly affect overall\n   network
    performance and to optimize path/peering/policy planning for\n   meeting application-specific
    demands.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
