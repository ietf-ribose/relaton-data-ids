abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines mechanisms
    for\n   extensibility.  The mechanisms provided are for Attribute-Value\n   Pair
    (AVP) fields received in control messages to be set as\n   Mandatory or not.  This
    document specifies a mechanism whereby an\n   L2TP implementation can signal its
    support of the set of L2TP\n   extensions that it supports.  This then allows
    the L2TP\n   implementations to use extensions such as L2TP message types not\n
    \  defined in [1], the presence of existing AVPs in messages they are\n   not
    currently defined to be in, and the definition of new AVPs that\n   can be marked
    as Mandatory, beyond those defined in [1].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
