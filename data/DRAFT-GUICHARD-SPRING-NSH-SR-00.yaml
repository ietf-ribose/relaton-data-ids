abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two application scenarios where Network\n
    \  Service Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) techniques can be\n   deployed
    together to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an\n   efficient manner
    while maintaining separation of the service and\n   transport planes as originally
    intended by the SFC architecture.\n\n   In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC
    is created using SR as the\n   transport between SFFs.  SR in this case is just
    one of many\n   encapsulations that could be used to maintain the transport-\n
    \  independent nature of NSH-based service chains.\n\n   In the second scenario,
    SR is used to represent each service hop of\n   the NSH-based SFC as a segment
    within the segment-list.  SR and NSH\n   in this case are integrated.\n\n   In
    both scenarios SR is responsible for steering packets between SFFs\n   along a
    given SFP while NSH is responsible for maintaining the\n   integrity of the service
    plane, the SFC instance context, and any\n   associated metadata.\n\n   These
    application scenarios demonstrate that NSH and SR can work\n   jointly and complement
    each other leaving the network operator with\n   the flexibility to use whichever
    transport technology makes sense in\n   specific areas of their network infrastructure,
    and still maintain an\n   end-to-end service plane using NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
