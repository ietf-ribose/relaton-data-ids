abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends [RFC6830] to allow Map Servers to send SMR messages.
    This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments that use LISP as
    a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant with [RFC6830]. In this
    use-case mapping updates do not come from ETRs, but rather from a centralized
    controller that pushes the updates directly to the Mapping System. In such deployments,
    Map Servers will benefit from having a mechanism to inform directly (P)ITRs about
    updates in the mappings they are serving. Although implementations of this extension
    exist, this extension has been deprecated by [I-D.rodrigueznatal-lisp-pubsub]
    and it is documented for informational purposes only.</p>"
