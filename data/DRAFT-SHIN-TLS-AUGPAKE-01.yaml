abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated\n
    \  key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy\n   password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In\n   general, the user
    password is chosen from a small set of dictionary\n   whose space is within the
    off-line dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE\n   protocol described here is secure
    against passive attacks, active\n   attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on
    the obtained messages\n   with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance
    to server\n   compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security).  Based on
    the\n   AugPAKE protocol, this document also specifies a new password-only\n   authentication
    handshake for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
