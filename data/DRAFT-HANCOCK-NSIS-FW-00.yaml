abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NSIS working group is considering protocol developments in
    \nsignaling for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the \nnetwork.
    The requirements for such signaling are being developed in a \nseparate document
    [2]; This Internet Draft proposes a framework for \nsuch signaling. This initial
    version provides a model for describing \nthe entities that take part in the signaling
    and the ways in which \nthey can be used in different modes of operation. It also
    discusses \nthe overall structure of such a signaling protocol. Finally, it \nconsiders
    the possible interactions of NSIS signaling with other \nprotocols and functions,
    including security issues. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
