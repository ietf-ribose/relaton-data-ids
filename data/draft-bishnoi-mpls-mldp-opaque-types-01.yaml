abstract:
- content: "<p>[MLDP] describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    for setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). LDP forwarding equivalence class (FEC) elements used
    to establish P2MP and MP2MP LSPs include type- length-value (TLV) fields that
    carry information meaningful to Ingress LSRs and Leaf LSRs and are termed as Opaque
    Value Elements in [MLDP]. This document defines Opaque Value Element structure
    to be used for provisioning P2MP and MP2MP Provider tunnels (P-Tunnels) for Multicast
    Virtual Private Network (MVPN). It is envisioned that this would be useful for
    security and manageability of P-Tunnels used for MVPN from the ones provisioned
    for other applications and vice-versa.</p>"
