abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A wide array of information is being carried (or proposed to
    be\n   carried) through BGP peering sessions.  While this information is\n   necessary
    and valid, BGP was not designed to carry blobs of\n   information, but rather
    network layer reachability and information\n   related directly to forwarding
    traffic from peer to peer.  This\n   document proposes a new BGP message type
    with a well defined\n   structure to use BGP peering sessions for information
    passed from\n   provider to provider along edge peering points, the BGP based
    Generic\n   transPort (bgpBGP).  This message type is designed to allow any pair\n
    \  of BGP speakers to transfer information within an existing session,\n   or
    for BGP peering semantics to be used with multihop sessions\n   between \"information
    exchange speakers\" within an autonomous system.\n   The new message type is designed
    to provide flexibility by allowing\n   the encoding of virtually any information
    within a BGP session\n   through the use of type-length-vector formatting.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
