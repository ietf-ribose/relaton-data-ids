abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MANET Working Group is developing management interfaces,
    i.e.,\n   Management Information Base (MIB) modules, for its control protocols,\n
    \  e.g., Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP), Simplified Multicast\n   Forwarding
    (SMF), etc.  The NETMOD Working group is developing a set\n   of standard YANG
    modules for the basic configuration management of\n   standard IP capable devices.
    Future IP capable radio networks will\n   rely upon these and other modules for
    their management. The\n   convergence of these activities requires the development
    of a\n   conceptual radio management model to help promote a consistent set of\n
    \  modules for the configuration, monitoring and notification management\n   of
    typical wireless radio devices.  This document provides such a\n   framework.\n\n\n\t
