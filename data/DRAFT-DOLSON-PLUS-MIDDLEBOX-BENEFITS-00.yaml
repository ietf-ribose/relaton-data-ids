abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate
    (PLUS)\n   protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits\n
    \  that might be provided by permitting middleboxes to have some\n   visibility
    to transport-layer information.\n\n   This document summarizes benefits provided
    to the Internet by\n   middleboxes -- intermediary devices that provide functions
    apart from\n   normal IP routing between a source and destination host [RFC3234].\n\n
    \  RFC3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the internet\n   circa
    2002.  Most of those middleboxes utilized or modified\n   application-layer data.
    \ This document will focus primarily on\n   devices that observe and act on information
    found in the transport\n   layer, most commonly TCP at this time.\n\n   A primary
    goal of this document is to provide information to working\n   groups developing
    new transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and\n   QUIC working groups, to
    aid understanding of what might be gained or\n   lost by design decisions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
