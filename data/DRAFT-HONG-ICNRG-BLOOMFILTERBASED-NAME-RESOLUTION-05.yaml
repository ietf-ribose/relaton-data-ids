abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable
    and\n  location independent names are assigned directly to the named data\n  which
    raises scalability issues and they get even worse with flat\n  names. Accordingly,
    name resolution system required for lookup-by-\n  name routing in ICN has to be
    designed to scale, also considering\n  mobility support. In this draft, a bloom
    filter-based flat name\n  resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the bloom
    filter as an\n  aggregated form of names and hierarchical structure of the B-NRS
    are\n  exploited to address the scalability issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
