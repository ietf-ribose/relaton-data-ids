abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively
    Scalable Data Center) networks. This document proposes some extensions to OSPF
    so as to reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC networks greatly. The reduction
    of the OSPF flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.
    These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</p>"
