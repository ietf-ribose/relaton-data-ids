abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents use cases for security measures in scenarios\n
    \  involving constrained RESTful devices.  Special focus is placed on\n   access
    control and authentication.  Where specific details are\n   relevant, it is assumed
    that the devices use CoAP as communication\n   protocol, however most conclusions
    apply generally.\n\n   A number of security requirements are derived from the
    use cases,\n   which are intended as a guideline for developing a comprehensive\n
    \  authentication and authorization approach for this class of\n   scenarios.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
