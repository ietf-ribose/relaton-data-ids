abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RSVP-TE [RSVPTE] can signal explicit paths with loose or strict
    hops\n   in a MPLS network. Using loose hops can shorten the ERO, but can not\n
    \  reduce the overhead associated with an RSVP signaled LSP since path\n   states
    are still created on every hop along the path.\n\n   In this paper, we propose
    a mechanism that can reduce the signaling\n   and maintenance overhead associated
    with loose hops in an RSVP\n   signaled LSP in an LDP enabled network. The mechanism
    can also be\n   generalized to work with other tunneling technologies such as
    GRE or\n   IP-in-IP.\n\t </p>\n      "
