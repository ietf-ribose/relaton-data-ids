abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the recent widely deployment of large public Wifi network,
    and\n   the integration with cellular network.  EAP based authentication has\n
    \  been considered as the good candidate to improve the Wifi user\n   experience
    similarly to the extend of GSM network.  Couple of new\n   functions which could
    enhance CAPWAP protocol have been raised to\n   improve the large carrier grade
    Wifi network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
