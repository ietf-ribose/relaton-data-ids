abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes how to prepare internationalized iSCSI names
    to increase the likelihood that name input and comparison work in ways that make
    sense for typical users throughout the world. The Internet Small Computer Systems
    Interface (iSCSI) protocol provides a way for hosts to access SCSI devices over
    an IP network. The iSCSI end-points, called initiators and targets, each have
    a globally-unique name that must be transcribable, as well as easily compared.
