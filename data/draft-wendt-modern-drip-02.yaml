abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for allowing a distributed set of
    nodes to synchronize a set of information in real-time with minimal amount of
    delay. This is useful for registry types of information like identity and telephone
    numbers with associated routing and ownership information and could be extended
    to support other distributed real-time information updates as well.</p>"
