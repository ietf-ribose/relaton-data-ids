abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives
    a\n   response with response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain\n   name
    which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE
    PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the\n   IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations)
    group, through its mailing list.  The\n   source of the document, as well as a
    list of open issues, is\n   currently kept at Github [1].\n\n   This documents
    clarifies RFC 1034 and modifies a bit RFC 2308 so it\n   updates both of them.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
