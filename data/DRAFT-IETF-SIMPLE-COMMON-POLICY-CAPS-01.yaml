abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An important component of presence and location services is policy.\nPolicy
    systems allow the presentity or location target to grant\naccess to specific pieces
    of information to specific watchers or\nrequestors.  These policy systems can
    be extremely simple, allowing a\nuser to accept or block requests based solely
    on the identity of the\nrequestor, to extremely complex, allowing for time based
    rules that\ngrant or deny specific pieces of information.  Policy systems often\nsupport
    vendor proprietary features.  To allow for interoperability\nbetween clients which
    set such policies, and servers which execute\nthem, it is necessary for clients
    to be able to determine the\ncapabilities of the server to which it is connected.
    \ This\nspecification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based\nformat
    for expressing such capabilities.\n\t </p>\n      "
