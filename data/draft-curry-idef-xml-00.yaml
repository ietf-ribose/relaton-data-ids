abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDEF) is todefine
    data formats and exchange procedures for sharing informationof interest to intrusion
    detection and response systems, and to themanagement systems which may need to
    interact with them. The goalsand requirements of the IDEF are described in [2].This
    Internet-Draft describes a proposed implementation of the dataformat component
    of the IDEF, using the Extensible Markup Language(XML) [3] to represent the class
    hierarchy defined by Debar andHuang [4]. The rationale for choosing XML is explained,
    a DocumentType Definition (DTD) is developed, and examples are provided.</p>"
