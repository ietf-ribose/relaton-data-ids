abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sutton SignWriting is the universal and complete solution for
    written\n   sign language, ISO 15924 script code \"Sgnw\".  It has been applied
    by\n   a wide and deep international community of sign language users.\n   Sutton
    SignWriting is an international standard for writing sign\n   languages by hand
    or with computers.  From education to research,\n   from entertainment to religion,
    SignWriting has proven useful because\n   people are using it to write signed
    languages.\n\n   Formal SignWriting is one particular computerized design for
    Sutton\n   SignWriting that envisions a sign as a two part word.  Each word is\n
    \  written as a string of characters that can be recognized and\n   processed
    by regular expressions.  The design has been optimized for\n   display, searching,
    sorting, text flow, and other character\n   processing.\n\n   Where as American
    Sign Language is a natural language, Formal\n   SignWriting is a formal language.
    \ A formal language uses words and\n   punctuation to form text.  Each word is
    expressed as a string of\n   characters.  Well-formed words are governed by the
    structural rules\n   of the grammar.  A formal language is useful in mathematics,
    computer\n   science, and linguistics.\n\n   This memo defines a conceptual character
    encoding map for the\n   Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination,\n
    \  implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t
