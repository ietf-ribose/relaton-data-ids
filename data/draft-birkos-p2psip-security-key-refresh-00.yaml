abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes security extensions that are applicable to P2PSIP
    overlays that follow the base protocol described in the WG leading drafts. The
    proposed extensions exploit symmetric/asymmetric cryptography and a key refresh
    mechanism to protect the signaling exchanged between the participating peers in
    order to enhance the robustness of the system against several types of attacks
    that are common to peer-to-peer networks. The refresh mechanism is either supervised
    by higher-level trusted peers or exclusively controlled by the members of the
    overlay.</p>"
