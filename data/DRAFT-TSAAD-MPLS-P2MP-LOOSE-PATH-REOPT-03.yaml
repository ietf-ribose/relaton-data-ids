abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a Traffic Engineered (TE) point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label\n
    \  Switched Path (LSP), it is preferable in some cases to re-evaluate\n   and
    re-optimize the entire P2MP-TE LSP by re-signaling all its S2L\n   sub-LSP(s).
    Existing mechanisms allow the path re-evaluation and the\n   signaling of a the
    notification of preferred path exists for a single\n   S2L sub-LSP only.\n\n   This
    document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow an\n   ingress Label Switching
    Router (LSR) of a P2MP-TE LSP to trigger the\n   re-evaluation of the entire LSP
    tree containing one or more S2L sub-\n   LSPs whose paths are loose (or abstract)
    hop expanded, and for a mid-\n   point LSR to signal to the ingress LSR that a
    better tree exists for\n   the entire P2MP-TE LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
