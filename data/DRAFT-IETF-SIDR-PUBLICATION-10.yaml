abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a protocol for publishing Resource Public
    Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI) objects.  Even though the RPKI will have many\n
    \  participants issuing certificates and creating other objects, it is\n   operationally
    useful to consolidate the publication of those objects.\n   Even in cases where
    a certificate issuer runs their own publication\n   repository, it can be useful
    to run the certificate engine itself on\n   a different machine from the publication
    repository.  This document\n   defines a protocol which addresses these needs.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
