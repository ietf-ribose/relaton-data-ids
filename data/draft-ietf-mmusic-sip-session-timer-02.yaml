abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the SIP specification. Thisextension
    adds a new message header that is used to specify theduration of a requested session.
    The session timer can be used to control the duration of a sessionif, for instance,
    one of the participants in the session wants tolimit the cost of the session.
    It can also be used by stateful SIPProxy Servers to track the status of sessions
    for which session stateexists on the servers. Currently a stateful SIP Proxy Server
    that isnot handling the media stream(s) for the session has no mechanism todefinitively
    determine the state of all sessions for which it has state.While the SIP Specification
    does provide the BYE method for terminatingthe session, there is no mechanism
    for a SIP Proxy Server to detect theend of a session when the BYE message is not
    sent or is lost due tonetwork problems.</p>"
