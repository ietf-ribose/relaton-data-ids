abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8938, the Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework relies
    on the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow. But the full DetNet operations require
    also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as a sequence within that
    flow, and to transport different types of packets along the same path with the
    same treatment, e.g., Operations, Administration, and Maintenance packets and/or
    multiple flows with fate and resource sharing. This document introduces new Hop-by-Hop
    header options that can signal that information to the intermediate relays.</p>"
