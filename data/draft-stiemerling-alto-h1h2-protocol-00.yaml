abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in several equivalent
    replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
    hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired resource. This
    memo proposes one possible way of implementing the ALTO protocol, called H1H2.
    The H1H2 protocol is a client/server protocols between end hosts and ALTO servers
    that allows two different ways of exchanging data between the server and the client.</p>"
