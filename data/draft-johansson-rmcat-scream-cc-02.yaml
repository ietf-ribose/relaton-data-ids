abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes a rate adaptation framework for conversational
    video services. The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and
    uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control algorithm. The framework
    is evaluated over both simulated bottleneck scenarios as well as in a LTE (Long
    Term Evolution) system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency and
    high video throughput in these scenarios.</p>"
