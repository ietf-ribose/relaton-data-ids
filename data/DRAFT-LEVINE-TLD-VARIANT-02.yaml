abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides
    a\n   method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS.\n   Some
    languages allow a particular host name to be written in multiple\n   ways because
    some characters have multiple representations, often\n   known as \"variants\".
    \ This document surveys the approaches that\n   ICANN-contracted top level domains
    have taken to the registration and\n   provisioning of domain names that have
    variants.  This document is\n   not (and will not be) a product of the IETF, does
    not (and will not)\n   propose any method to make variants work \"correctly\",
    and is not (and\n   will not be) an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
