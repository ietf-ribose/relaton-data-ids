abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector
    routing\n   protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing.\n
    \  It has been designed from scratch to work at both low and high\n   bandwidth
    networks - even with high packet loss.  The objective was\n   to keep routing
    overhead low and ensure a deterministic protocol\n   exchange behavior.  DMPR
    can be used to manage larger networks with\n   characteristics based on BGPv4
    with transport and self-configuration\n   properties taken from OSPF/OLSR.  Unlike
    BGPv4 or OSPF, DMPR does not\n   support higher network separation concepts.  A
    DMPR network is a flat\n   network in which DMPR nodes have equal tasks.  This
    also applies to\n   DMPR communication.  Unlike OLSR/OSPF there is no flooding
    messages\n   (topology broadcast), information are stored, accumulated/compressed\n
    \  and forwarded at each DMPR node.  This feature contributes to the\n   message
    load being deterministic.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
