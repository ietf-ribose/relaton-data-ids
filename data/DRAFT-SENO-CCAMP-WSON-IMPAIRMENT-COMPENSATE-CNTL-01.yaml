abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes requirements of compensation control of optical
    \nimpairments such as chromatic dispersion for dynamic optical paths, \nas well
    as automatic discovery of fiber-related impairments over \nlinks by collaboration
    of a pair of adjacent nodes upon installation. \nIt is intended as a supplement
    to the wavelength switched optical \nnetworks (WSON) framework with impairments,
    because GMPLS-based \nautomatic adjustment of impairment compensation and automatic
    \ndiscovery of link impairments will improve usability of WSON.\n\t </p>\n      "
