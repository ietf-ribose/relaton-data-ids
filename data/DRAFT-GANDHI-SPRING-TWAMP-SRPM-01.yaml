abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label\n
    \  Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document\n   specifies
    procedures for sending and processing synthetic probe query\n   and response messages
    for Performance Measurement (PM).  The\n   procedure uses the mechanisms defined
    in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active\n   Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)) for Delay Measurement,
    and also uses\n   the mechanisms specified in this document for direct-mode Loss\n
    \  Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and\n   SRv6
    data planes for both links and end-to-end measurement for SR\n   Policies.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
