abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>If the Internet is accessed via cellular networks, the Point-to-Point\nprotocol
    (PPP) is most commonly used for configuration of the\ncircuit-switched or packet-switched
    link.  Thus, this PPP\nconfiguration time comes in addition to the usual call-setup
    time for\nthe cellular connection.  In many cases this will result in a fairly\nlong
    'wait time' as perceived by end users before actual application\ndata can be transmitted.\nThis
    proposal describes a solution in which the PPP configuration\ntime can be significantly
    reduced (on the order of seconds) in cases\nwhere both peer protocol entities
    can be modified according to this\nproposal, which involves modifying standard
    PPP.  In cases where one\nPPP peer is modified and the other utilizes only standard
    PPP, the\nmodified peer can fallback to standard PPP operation.  This fallback\nmechanism
    will not noticeably affect the PPP setup time, and serves\nto ensure interoperability.\n\n\t
