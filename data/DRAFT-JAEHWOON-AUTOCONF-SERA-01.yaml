abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the connected MANET, the MANET Border Router (MBR) is used
    to\nconnect the MANET with the external network and MANET nodes are \nrequired
    to know the MBR address to communicate with hosts in the \nexternal network. One
    way of acquiring the MBR address is to use the \nRouter Advertisement (RA) and
    the Router Solicitation (RS) messages.\nIn order to allow RA/RS messages to be
    delivered in the multi-hop\nMANET, the modified RA/RS message has been defined
    [4]. However, \nthis approach may incur the duplicate packet reception problem
    due \nto rebroadcasting of received RA/RS messages to its neighbors.\nIn this
    draft, we define the scope-extended Router Advertisement/\nSolicitation message
    for announcing/solicitating the MBR address in\nthe connected MANET. In the scope-extended
    RA/RS message, a new \nmessage field, the sequence number field, is defined so
    that \nduplicate RA/RS messages can be detected based on the sequence \nnumber
    and the MBR address included in the message.\n\t </p>\n      "
