abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo introduces an alternative dynamic MAP (Mobility Anchor
    \nPoint) discovery and selection procedure for HMIPv6 (Hierarchical \nMobile IPv6).
    \ \n        \nA new dynamic MAP discovery method is defined in order to change
    the \nsize of MAP domain. Subsequent MAP selection algorithm enables to \nlocate
    MAP on the closest and highest level of hierarchical structure \nof routers. Addressed
    method is beneficial not only for the \nperformance of localized mobility management
    but also for the \nlocation privacy. Also it gives flexible domain designing capability
    \nto the operators. \n\t </p>\n      "
