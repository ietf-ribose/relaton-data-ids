abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to transport IKEv2 and IPSec
    packets\n   over a TCP connection for traversing network middleboxes that may\n
    \  block IKEv2 negotiation over UDP.  This method, referred to as TCP\n   encapsulation,
    involves sending all packets for tunnel establishment\n   as well as tunneled
    packets over a TCP connection.  This method is\n   intended to be used as a fallback
    option when IKE cannot be\n   negotiated over UDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
