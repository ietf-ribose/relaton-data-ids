    (DRDP)\n   that enables a DNS client to discover various available local and\n
    \  global resolving service.  The discovery is primarily initiated by a\n   DNS
    client, but a resolving service may also inform the DNS client\n   other resolving
    services are available and eventually preferred.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
