abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include capabilities
    to request partial responses. In fact, according to the user authorization, the
    server can only return full responses. Partial responses capability, especially
    in the case of search queries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers.
    This document describes a RDAP query extension that allows clients to specify
    their preference for obtaining a partial response.</p>"
