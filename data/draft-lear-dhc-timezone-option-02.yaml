abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP defines an option for a server to deliver to a client offset from
    UTC. This information in and of itself is not sufficient for devices to portray
    local time both accurately and consistently. This memo specifies a new option
    for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to do so.</p>"
