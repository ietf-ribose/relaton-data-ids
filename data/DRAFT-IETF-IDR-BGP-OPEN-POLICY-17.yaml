abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate\n
    \  assumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route\n   learned
    from one transit provider to another transit provider or a\n   lateral (i.e.,
    non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from\n   one lateral peer to another
    lateral peer or a transit provider.\n   These are usually the result of misconfigured
    or absent BGP route\n   filtering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems
    (ASes).\n   Existing approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by\n
    \  operator configuration, with no check that the configuration\n   corresponds
    to that of the eBGP neighbor, or enforcement that the two\n   eBGP speakers agree
    on the relationship.  This document enhances the\n   BGP OPEN message to establish
    an agreement of the relationship on\n   each eBGP session between autonomous systems
    in order to enforce\n   appropriate configuration on both sides.  Propagated routes
    are then\n   marked according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention\n
    \  and detection of route leaks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
