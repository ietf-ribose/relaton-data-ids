abstract:
- content: "<p>The delivery of value-added services relies on the invocation of advanced
    Service Functions in a sequential order. This mechanism is called Service Function
    Chaining (SFC). The set of involved Service Functions and their order depends
    on the service context and other deployment-specific considerations. Having a
    single use case document eases the effort of deriving requirements that are to
    be met by SFC solution(s). Moreover, it allows to identify commonalities between
    the various use cases that are of interest. This document presents a set of general
    use cases of Service Function Chaining (SFC).</p>"
