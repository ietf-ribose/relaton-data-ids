abstract:
  content: <p>This memo describes a process for early allocation of code points by
    IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC Required", "IETF
    Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply. This process can be used to alleviate
    the problem where code point allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required
    implementation and deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC that would
    normally trigger code point allocation. This document obsoletes RFC 4020.</p>
