abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Maintaining reachability of an EID prefix despite the failures
    of\nETRs is a key concern in the LISP architecture.  In this document, we\nfirst
    analyse this problem in comparison with traditional routing\nprotocols.  Then,
    we explain how Internet Service Providers could\noffer a service that preserves
    the reachability of the LISP ETRs of\ntheir customers in case of failures.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
