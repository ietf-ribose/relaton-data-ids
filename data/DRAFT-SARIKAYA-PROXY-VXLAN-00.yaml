abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In data centers there is interest in offloading network functions
    to\n   the switches in order to keep the server focused on computation not\n   networking.
    \ IEEE 802.1Qbg or Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA)\n   at the hypervisor
    simply forces each VM frame sent out to the\n   external switch regardless of
    destination.  In this case, the\n   eXtensible Local Area Network operation or
    proxying at a higher level\n   switch is needed.  Communication functions of the
    eXtensible Local\n   Area Network are moved above to the Top of Rack switches.
    \ Top of\n   Rack switch encapsulates the packets and directs them to their\n
    \  destination.  Packets from the eXtensible Local Area Network servers\n   are
    decapsulated before sending it to the destination proxy servers.\n\n\t </p>\n
