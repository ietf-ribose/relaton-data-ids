abstract:
- content: "<p>Source-specific routing is an extension to traditional next-hop routing
    where packets are forwarded according to both their destination and their source
    address. This document describes the source-specific routing extension to the
    Standard Track's Babel routing protocol defined in [BABEL]. It is incompatible
    with the Experimental Track's Babel [RFC6126]. Source-specific routing is also
    known as Source Address Dependent Routing, SAD Routing, SADR, Destination/Source
    Routing or Source/ Destination Routing.</p>"
