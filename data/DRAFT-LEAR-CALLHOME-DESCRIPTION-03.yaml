abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many devices make use of so-called \"Call Home\" functionality
    in order\n   to be managed or updated, or to otherwise establish outbound\n   communication
    in the face of NATs, firewalls, and mobility.  This\n   memo defines call home
    functionality, discusses the requirement for\n   firewall traversal, some mechanisms
    used, and security considerations\n   of those mechanisms.  Several existing examples
    will be shown.  This\n   memo also contains examples of how one would make SNMP
    over SSH,\n   NETCONF over SSH, and interactive terminal access call-home\n   protocols.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
