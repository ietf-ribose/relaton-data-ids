abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For many carrier's, the implementation of Virtual Private Network\n
    \  (VPN) services using current IP Tunneling technology is problematic\n   because
    of onerous configuration requirements. The VPMT is an\n   protocol for the dynammic
    distribution of VPN information throughout\n   a shared network, which in turn
    allows the automatic formation of\n   point to multi-point tunnels between VPN
    routers.\n \n   The method described in this internet draft  is intended for single\n
    \  AS where the AS administrator is a trusted third party.  Traffic\n   seperation
    is maintained between VPNs.\n\t </p>\n      "
