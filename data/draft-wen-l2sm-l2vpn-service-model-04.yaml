abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
    a Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service. This model is intended to be instantiated
    at management system to deliver the overall service. This model is not a configuration
    model to be used directly on network elements, but provides an abstracted view
    of the Layer 2 VPN service configuration components. It is up to a management
    system to take this as an input and use specific configurations models to configure
    the different network elements to deliver the service. How configuration of network
    elements is done is out of scope of the document. The data model in this document
    includes support for point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) and multipoint
    Virtual Private LAN services (VPLS) that use Pseudowires signaled using the Label
    Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as described
    in RFC4761 and RFC6624.</p>"
