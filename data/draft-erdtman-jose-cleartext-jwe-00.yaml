abstract:
- content: "<p>Cleartext JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a means of representing encrypted
    content as a JSON object without representing JSON values to be integrity protected
    in a non-JSON representation, such as base64url-encoded JSON. The integrity protection
    calculation for the authenticated encryption performed uses the predictable JSON
    serialization defined in ECMAScript version 6. Cleartext JWE builds on the JWE,
    JWA, and JWK specifications, reusing data structures and semantics from these
    specifications, where applicable.</p>"
