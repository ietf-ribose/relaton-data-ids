abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7556 [RFC7556] provides the essential conceptual guidance
    an API\n   designer would need to support use of PvDs.  This document aims to\n
    \  capture the requirements for an API that can be used by applications\n   that
    would be considered \"advanced\", according to section 6.3 [1] of\n   RFC 7556
    [RFC7556].  The \"basic\" [2] and \"intermediate\" [3] API\n   support levels
    can in principle be implemented by means of layers\n   wrapping the advanced API.\n\n\t
