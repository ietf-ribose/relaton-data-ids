abstract:
  content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on theInternet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in manynetworks. In P2P applications,
    one technique for reducing the totalamount of P2P traffic is to introduce storage
    capabilities within thenetwork. Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches)
    provide suchstorage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supportingindividual
    P2P application protocols) and they do not allow users tomanage access to content
    in the cache. For example, ContentProviders cannot easily control access and resource
    usage policies tosatisfy their own requirements. This document discusses theintroduction
    of in-network storage for P2P applications, shows theneed for a standard protocol
    for accessing this storage, andidentifies the scope of this protocol. The accessing
    protocol canalso be used by other applications with similar requirements.</p>"
