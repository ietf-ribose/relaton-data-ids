  content: "\t <t>PMIP and LISP are both network-based. Integration of PMIP with ahierarchical
    design into the LISP network provides network-basedfast-mobility support to enable
    a mobile node to perform handover inboth LISP and non-LISP networks, and non-optimal
    PMIP routes in theLISP network are avoided.</p>"
