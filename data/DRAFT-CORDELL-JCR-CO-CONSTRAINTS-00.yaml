abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON Content Rules (JCR) [JCR] provides a powerful, intuitive
    and\n   concise method for defining the structure of JSON [RFC7159] messages.\n
    \  However, modern JSON usage patterns occasionally mean that JCR alone\n   is
    not able to capture the required constraints in a satisfactory\n   way.  This
    document describes JCR Co-Constraints (JCRCC) which\n   defines additional JCR
    directives and annotations that can be added\n   to a JCR ruleset in order to
    define more detailed constraints on JSON\n   messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
