abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the growth and commercialization of the Internet, the need
    for\n   secure IP multicast is growing. In this draft we present a taxonomy of\n
    \  multicast security issues. We first sketch some multicast group\n   parameters
    that are relevant to security, and outline the basic\n   security issues concerning
    multicast in general, with emphasis on IP\n   multicast. Next we suggest two `benchmark'
    scenarios for secure\n   multicast solutions. Lastly we review some previous works.\n
    \n   This is a temporary version of the document. The authors will be\n   grateful
    for remarks, and will update and revise this document\n   accordingly.\n\t </p>\n
