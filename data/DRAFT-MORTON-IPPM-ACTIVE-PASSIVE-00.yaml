abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive\n
    \  performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can\n   be
    described as Active or Passive.  Methods can take on some of the\n   attributes
    of both, and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
