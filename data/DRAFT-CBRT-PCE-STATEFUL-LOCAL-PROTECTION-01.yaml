abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] can apply global concurrent optimizations
    to\n   optimize LSP placement.  In a deployment where a PCE is used to\n   compute
    all the paths, it may be beneficial for the local protection\n   paths to also
    be computed by the PCE.  This document defines\n   extensions needed for the setup
    and management of RSVP-TE protection\n   paths by the PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
