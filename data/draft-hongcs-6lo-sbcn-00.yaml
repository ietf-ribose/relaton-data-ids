abstract:
  content: "<p>Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage
    ofsensing technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased theuse
    of wearable devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings.A typical
    wearable device has low resources in terms of power and processingcapabilities.
    Reducing the energy consumption is one of the key design factorsin a wearable
    network so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idlelistening and overhearing
    are major causes of energy consumption. These issuescan be resolved by maximizing
    the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoidunnecessary wakeup time
    (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeupscheduling to handle the sleep/wakeup
    cycle of a device can be adapted.This document describes how a 2wakeup scheduling
    using an out-of-bound externalwake up mechanism can work to successfully increase
    the lifetime of a typicalbody-centric wearable network (S-BCN).</p>"
