abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for authenticating OSPF
    packets \n   by making use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunction with the SHA \n
    \  family of cryptographic hash functions. Because of the way the hash \n   functions
    are used in HMAC construction, the collision attacks \n   currently known against
    SHA-1 do not apply. \n    \n   This will be done in addition to the already documented
    \n   authentication schemes described in the base specification. \n\n\t </p>\n
