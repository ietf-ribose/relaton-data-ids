abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  AERO interfaces\n
    \  use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the\n   IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding.\n   Prefix delegation
    services are employed for network admission and to\n   manage the routing system.
    \ Multilink operation, mobility management,\n   quality of service (QoS) signaling
    and route optimization are\n   naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache
    updates.  Standard\n   IP multicasting services are also supported.  AERO is a
    widely-\n   applicable tunneling solution especially well-suited to aviation\n
    \  services, mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and many other\n   applications.\n\n\t
