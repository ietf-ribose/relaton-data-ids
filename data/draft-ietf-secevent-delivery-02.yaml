abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines how a series of security event tokens (SETs)
    may be delivered to a previously registered receiver using HTTP POST over TLS
    initiated as a push to the receiver, or as a poll by the receiver. The specification
    also defines how delivery can be assured subject to the SET Token Receiver's need
    for assurance.</p>"
