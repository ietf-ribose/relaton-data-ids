abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and a mapping function
    for 5G\n   mobile user plane with transport network slicing, integrated with\n
    \  Mobile Radio Access and a Virtualized Core Network.  The integrated\n   approach
    is specified in a way to fit into the 5G core network\n   architecture defined
    in [TS23.501].\n\n   It focuses on an optimized mobile user plane functionality
    with\n   various transport services needed for some of the 5G traffic needing\n
    \  low and deterministic latency, real-time, mission-critical services.\n   This
    document describes, how this objective is achieved agnostic to\n   the transport
    underlay used (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS) in various deployments\n   and with a new transport
    network underlay routing, called Preferred\n   Path Routing (PPR).\n\n\n\t </p>\n
