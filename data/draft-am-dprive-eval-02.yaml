abstract:
- content: "<p>The set of DNS requests that an individual makes can provide a monitor
    with a large amount of information about that individual. DNS Private Exchange
    (DPRIVE) aims to deprive this actor of this information. This document describes
    methods for measuring the performance of DNS privacy mechanisms, particularly
    it provides methods for measuring effectiveness in the face of pervasive monitoring
    as defined in RFC7258. The document includes example evaluations for common use
    cases.</p>"
