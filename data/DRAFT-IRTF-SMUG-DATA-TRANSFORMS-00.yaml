abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the framework document &lt;draft-irtf-smug-framework-00.txt&gt;,
    \nthe Secure Multicast Group (SMuG) has identified three functionalities \nthat
    deal with security transformations for the multicasted \ndata. These are data
    encryption, source authentication, and group \nauthentication. This document expands
    on the issues to be taken \ninto consideration when designing transforms that
    realize these \nfunctionalities. These issues include the order of applying the
    \ntransforms, their placement in the  communication layers, possible \naggregation
    of several functionalities in a single transform, and \nthe relationships with
    other protocols (such as reliable multicast \nprotocols). Next a specific design
    is proposed, that attempts to meet \nthe requirements of prominent application
    in a simple yet flexible way. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
