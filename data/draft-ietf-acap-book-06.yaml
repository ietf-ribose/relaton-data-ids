abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internetapplications
    (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these savedURLs have become known as
    bookmarks. It would be desirable toaccess one's bookmarks from multiple clients
    and multiple machines.The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides
    anideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease ofcoordination
    and synchronization of bookmarks between diverseapplications and systems, as well
    as for hierarchy, inheritance, andsharing between users.This specification defines
    a standard ACAP dataset class forbookmarks.</p>"
