abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose
    design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small
    message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These
    design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1
    and MessagePack. This document is a revised edition of RFC 7049, with editorial
    improvements, added detail, and fixed errata. This revision formally obsoletes
    RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the interchange format from RFC
    7049. It does not create a new version of the format.</p>"
