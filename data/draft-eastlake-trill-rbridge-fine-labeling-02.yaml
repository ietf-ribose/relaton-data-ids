abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has standardized RBridges (Routing Bridges), devices that
    implement the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol, a
    standard for least cost transparent frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary
    topologies, using link-state routing and encapsulation with a hop count. The TRILL
    base protocol standard supports up to 4K VLAN IDs (Virtual Local Area Network
    IDentifiers). However, there are applications that require more fine-grained labeling
    of data and end stations. This document updates RFC 6325 by specifying extensions
    to the TRILL protocol to accomplish this.</p>"
