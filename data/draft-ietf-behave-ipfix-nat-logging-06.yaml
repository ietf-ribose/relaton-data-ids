abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators require NAT devices to log events like creation and
    deletion of translations and information about the resources that the NAT device
    is managing. The logs are essential in many cases to identify an attacker or a
    host that was used to launch malicious attacks and for various other purposes
    of accounting. Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different
    NAT devices log the information using proprietary formats and hence it is difficult
    to expect a consistent behavior. The lack of a consistent way to log the data
    makes it difficult to write the collector applications that would receive this
    data and process it to present useful information. This document describes the
    formats for logging of NAT events.</p>"
