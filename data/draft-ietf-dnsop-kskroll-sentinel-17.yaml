abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user and third parties to
    determine the trusted key state for the root key of the resolvers that handle
    that user's DNS queries. Note that this method is only applicable for determining
    which keys are in the trust store for the root key.</p>"
