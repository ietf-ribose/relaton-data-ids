abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a classification of Mail Based Servers (MBSs)
    based on their behaviour towards their users. The most important distinction is
    between mail responders (e.g. echo servers, file servers) and mail forwarders
    (e.g. mailing lists, auto-forwarders). The document aims at a global understanding
    of these MBS classes and other common MBS attributes, such as roles (administrators,
    owners), MBS lifetime and restricted MBS use.</p>"
