abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure,
    two\n   steps are necessary.  The first is to secure the routing protocols'\n
    \  packets on the wire.  The second is to ensure that the keying\n   material
    for the routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to\n   the appropriate
    routers.  This document specifies a way of organizing\n   the security parameters
    and a method for conveniently controlling\n   those parameters using YANG and
    NETCONF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
