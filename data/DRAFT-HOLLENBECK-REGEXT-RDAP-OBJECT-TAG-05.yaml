abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a method
    that\n   can be used to identify the authoritative server for processing\n   domain
    name, IP address, and autonomous system number queries.  The\n   method does not
    describe how to identify the authoritative server for\n   processing other RDAP
    query types, such as entity queries.  This\n   limitation exists because the identifiers
    associated with these query\n   types are typically unstructured.  This document
    describes an\n   operational practice that can be used to add structure to RDAP\n
    \  identifiers that makes it possible to identify the authoritative\n   server
    for additional RDAP queries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
