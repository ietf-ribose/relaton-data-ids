abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to provide greater scalability, network confidentiality,
    and\n   service independence, Segment Routing (SR) utilizes a Binding Segment\n
    \  Identifier (BSID).  It is possible to associate a BSID to an RSVP-TE-\n   signaled
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path or an SR Traffic\n   Engineering path.
    \ The BSID can be used by an upstream node for\n   steering traffic into the appropriate
    TE path to enforce SR policies.\n   This document specifies the binding value
    as an MPLS label or Segment\n   Identifier.  It further specifies an approach
    for reporting binding\n   label/Segment Identifier (SID) by a Path Computation
    Client (PCC) to\n   the Path Computation Element (PCE) to support PCE-based Traffic\n
    \  Engineering policies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
