abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.The
    model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975and RFC4976 in
    the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connectionestablishment, and it allows
    the usage of SDP in a more conventionalway for conveying endpoint address information.
    Because of this, themodel also allows for the usage of generic mainstream mechanisms
    forNAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.</p>"
