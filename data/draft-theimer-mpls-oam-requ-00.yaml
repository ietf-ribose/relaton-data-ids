abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the motivation for MPLS OAM functionality and
    possible requirements for OAM in MPLS networks. Examples of OAM functions include
    support for fault management, continuity checks, loopbacks, performance monitoring
    and protection switching. Such capabilities may be useful in many applications
    of MPLS networks, but a detailed set of requirements is currently not available.
    Further discussion and input is solicited, in particular from network operators
    and service providers.</p>"
