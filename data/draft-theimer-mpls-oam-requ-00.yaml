abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft discusses the motivation for MPLS OAM functionality andpossible
    requirements for OAM in MPLS networks. Examples of OAMfunctions include support
    for fault management, continuity checks,loopbacks, performance monitoring and
    protection switching. Suchcapabilities may be useful in many applications of MPLS
    networks, buta detailed set of requirements is currently not available. Furtherdiscussion
    and input is solicited, in particular from networkoperators and service providers.</p>"
