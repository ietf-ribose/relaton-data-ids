abstract:
  content: <p>This document suggests some strategies for the combined use of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).
    Such strategies aim to provide a single fully featured real-time communication
    service by using complementary subsets of features from each of the protocols.
    Typically such subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant
    messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP. This document does not define any
    new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP, and by intent it does not attempt
    to standardize "best current practices". However, implementing the suggested strategies
    outlined in this document may require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing
    client and server-side software. Also, it is not the purpose of this document
    to make recommendations as to whether or not such combined use should be preferred
    to the mechanisms provided natively by each protocol (for example, SIP's SIMPLE
    or XMPP's Jingle. It merely aims to provide guidance to those who are interested
    in such a combined use.</p>
