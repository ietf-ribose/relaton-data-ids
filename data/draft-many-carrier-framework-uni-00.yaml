abstract:
  content: "<p>This contribution describes a carriers optical services frameworkand
    associated requirements for the User-Network Interface (UNI). Itis intended to
    provide carrier specific service requirements for theautomatic switched optical
    networks to guide the on-going efforts todevelop the standard UNI and other interfaces
    to the optical layer(OL) control plane. Due to time constraints, no attempt has
    beenmade to provide detailed comprehensive requirements; instead wefocused on
    topics of particular interest or concern to the carriercommunity. This is a work-in-progress
    document and is expected toevolve in near term as new requirements are identified
    and furtherstudied.</p>"
