abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) can be applied to the IPv6 data plane
    by\n   leveraging a new type of routing extension header, called Segment\n   Routing
    Header (SRH).  An SRH contains an ordered list, or sequence,\n   of segments representing
    topological or service-based instructions,\n   or any combination of those.\n\n
    \  This draft provides an overview of IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6)\n   implementations
    and interoperability.  It makes an inventory of the\n   various pieces of hardware
    and software that have been demonstrated\n   to support the processing of an SRH,
    and details some\n   interoperability scenarios that have been showcased at a
    public\n   event.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
