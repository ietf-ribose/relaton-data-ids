abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on
    the\nInternet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and\ndestinations.
    \ However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or\ncharacteristics to a given
    resource identifier and subsequently\nassessing those attributes or characteristics
    has not been specified\nand deployed.\nTwo tasks are envisioned.  The first task
    will be to define a general\nresolution protocol that will translate resource
    identifiers to a\nlist of attributes.  The second task will be to define an\nadministrative
    model and update protocol that can be used to set up\nand maintain the information
    the resolution protocol accesses.\n\t </p>\n      "
