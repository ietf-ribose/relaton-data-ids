abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a YANG data model for Segment Routing
    IPv6\n   (SRv6) base.  The model serves as a base framework for configuring\n
    \  and managing an SRv6 subsystem and expected to be augmented by other\n   SRv6
    technology models accordingly.  Additionally, this document also\n   specifies
    the model for the SRv6 Static application.\n\n   The YANG modules in this document
    conform to the Network Management\n   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).\n\n\t </p>\n
