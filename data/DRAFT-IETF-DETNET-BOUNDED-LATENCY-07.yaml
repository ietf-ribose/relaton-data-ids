abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document references specific queuing mechanisms, defined
    in\n   other documents, that can be used to control packet transmission at\n   each
    output port and achieve the DetNet qualities of service.  This\n   document presents
    a timing model for sources, destinations, and the\n   DetNet transit nodes that
    relay packets that is applicable to all of\n   those referenced queuing mechanisms.
    \ Using the model presented in\n   this document, it should be possible for an
    implementor, user, or\n   standards development organization to select a particular
    set of\n   queuing mechanisms for each device in a DetNet network, and to select\n
    \  a resource reservation algorithm for that network, so that those\n   elements
    can work together to provide the DetNet service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
