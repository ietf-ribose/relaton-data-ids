abstract:
- content: "<p>The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level encryption
    of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security standpoint as it might be
    because of its opportunistic nature; message delivery is, by default, prioritized
    over security. This document describes an SMTP service extension, REQUIRETLS,
    and message header field, RequireTLS. If the REQUIRETLS option or RequireTLS message
    header field is used when sending a message, it asserts a request on the part
    of the message sender to override the default negotiation of TLS, either by requiring
    that TLS be negotiated when the message is relayed, or by requesting that recipient-side
    policy mechanisms such as MTA-STS and DANE be ignored when relaying a message
    for which security is unimportant.</p>"
