abstract:
- content: <p>Selective Encryption is good mechanism to improve performance of devices
    that support media encode/decode and transport and still meets basic requirement
    of confidentiality. SRTP is one of the popular mechanism used to support confidential
    media transport over IP channels. This draft suggests some enhancements to SRTP
    protocol management to enable SRTP to support "Selective Encryption".</p>
