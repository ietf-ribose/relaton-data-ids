abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides operational guidance to server operators
    to help\n   ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's\n   certificate
    chain via published TLSA records.  Guidance is also\n   provided to clients for
    selecting reliable TLSA record parameters to\n   use for server authentication.
    \ Finally, guidance is given to\n   protocol designers who wish to make use of
    TLSA records to secure\n   protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination.\n\n\t </p>\n
