abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Relative  Distance Micro-discovery
    Ad\nHoc Routing (RDMAR) protocol for use in mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs).
    \ The protocol is highly adaptive, bandwidth-efficient\nand scaleable.  A key
    concept in its design is that protocol\nreaction to link failures is typically
    localised to a very small\nregion of the network near the change. This desirable
    behaviour is\nachieved through the use of a novel mechanism for route discovery,\ncalled
    Relative Distance Micro-discovery (RDM).  The concept behind\nRDM is that a query
    flood can be localised by knowing the relative\ndistance (RD) between two terminals.
    \ To accomplish this, every\ntime a route search between the two terminals is
    triggered, an\niterative algorithm calculates an estimate of their RD, given an\naverage
    nodal mobility and information about the elapsed time since\nthey last communicated
    and their previous RD.  Based on the newly\ncalculated RD, the query flood is
    then localised to a limited\nregion of the network centred at the source node
    of the route\ndiscovery and with maximum propagation radius that equals to the\nestimated
    relative distance. This ability to localise query flooding\ninto a limited area
    of the network serves to increase scalability\nand minimise routing overhead and
    overall network congestion.\n\t </p>\n      "
