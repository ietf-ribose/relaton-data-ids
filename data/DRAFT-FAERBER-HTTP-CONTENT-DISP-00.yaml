abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC2183] introduces a Content-Disposition header field for
    Internet\n   Mail Messages to transmit presentation information as well as a\n
    \  suggested file name for saving the content to disk and the file's\n   date
    information.\n \n   All of this information is missing from HTTP entities [RFC2068].\n
    \  However, there is nothing that would prevent the use of the Content-\n   Disposition
    header with this HTTP.\n \n   Without being standard, the Content-Disposition
    header has already\n   been introduced by some software products. [HTTP1.1-REV]
    documents\n   this practice, based on [RFC1806].\n \n   This memo also extends
    the specification to cover [RFC2183] and\n   corrects the common abuse of the
    Content-Type header to cover\n   presentation information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
