abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current CCAMP works focus on intra-domain control plane. This
    \ndocument focuses on inter-domain control plane. It views the overall \nnetwork
    as a collection of administrative domains, partitioned by \noperators according
    to administrative, technological or geographical \nconsiderations. This document
    specifies a BGP/GMPLS based inter-domain \nsolution for setting up circuit LSPs(Label
    Switched Paths) that span \nmultiple administrative domains. A few extensions
    and modifications \nare proposed to BGP in order to disseminate appropriate topology
    \ninformation and calculate end-to-end circuit paths. GMPLS signaling is \nalso
    extended for the inter-domain connection operations. The solution \nspecified
    in this draft is fundermental for inter-domain operations \nand can be used as
    a base for various applications, e.g. OVPN. It is \nalso very flexible and scalable.\n\t
