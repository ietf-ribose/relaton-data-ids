abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the requirement of capability of information\n
    \  distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general,\n   information
    distribution can be categorized into two different modes:\n   1) one autonomic
    node instantly sends information to other nodes in\n   the domain; 2) one autonomic
    node publishes some information and\n   asynchronously some other interested nodes
    request the published\n   information. In the former case, information data will
    be generated\n   and consumed instantly. In the latter case, information data
    live\n   longer in the network.\n\n   These capabilities are basic and fundamental
    to an autonomous network\n   system (i.e. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]).
    This document\n   clarifies possible use cases of information distribution in
    ANI and\n   requirements to ANI so that rich information distribution can be\n
    \  natively supported. Possible options to realize the information\n   distribution
    function are also briefly discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
