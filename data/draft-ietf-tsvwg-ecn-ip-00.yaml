abstract:
  content: "<p>This document contributes to the effort to add explicit congestionnotification
    (ECN) to IP. In the current effort to standardise ECN for TCP it is unavoidably
    necessary to standardise certain new aspects of IP.However, the IP aspects will
    not and cannot only be specific to TCP. We specify interaction with features of
    IP such as fragmentation,differentiated services, multicast forwarding, and a
    definition of theservice offered to higher layer congestion control protocols.
    This documentonly concerns aspects related to the IP layer, but includes any aspectslikely
    to be common to all higher layer protocols. Any specification of ECNsupport in
    higher layer protocols is expected to appear in a separatespecification for each
    such protocol.</p>"
