abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many domain registries, especially sponsored TLDs and ccTLDs,
    have\nspecific policy that calls for the server to perform additional\nbackend
    processing before it completes a transform operation on an\nobject requested by
    a client. When the pending action is completed,\nthe server must notify the client
    about the outcome. However, current\nEPP core specifications do not address the
    notification messaging in\na generic way.  As a result, a registry has to resort
    to defining a\nnew schema as extension to the object mapping concerned for this\npurpose.\nInspired
    by recent discussions on the 'ietf-provreg' mailing list on\nrelated topics, this
    draft presents a strawman proposal for uniform\ntreatment of server notification
    for pending action in the base EPP\nprotocol. A new OPTIONAL child element is
    added to &lt;poll&gt; response as\nbasic notification content, which consists
    of the transaction ID that\ntriggered the pending action and the outcome of the
    pending action.\nIn addition, object specific data and extension information can
    be\npiggybacked in existing child elements of &lt;response&gt;.  The required\nmodification
    to the EPP base protocol is kept to the minimum and\nincurs no change to the EPP
    base object mappings. Most importantly,\nthe proposed solution is applicable to
    any object mapping, ensuring\nEPP's extensibility beyond domain registry applications.\nStrong
    interests by the registry community in deploying this feature\nwarrant that it
    be best handled as a generic but optional feature in\nthe EPP base protocol. This
    allows any registry to handle pending\naction without the need to define a new
    schema, eliminating the\nproliferation of ad hoc object extensions repetitively
    defined by\ndisparate registries for the very same purpose.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
