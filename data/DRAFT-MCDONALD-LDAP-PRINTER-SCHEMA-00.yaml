abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes,
    for\n   printers and printer services, for use with directories that support\n
    \  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is\n   based
    on the printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet\n   Printing Protocol/1.1
    (IPP) (RFC 2911).  A few additional printer\n   attributes are based on definitions
    in the Printer MIB (RFC 1759),\n   IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device
    ID (PWG 5107.2), or\n   IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (IPP
    JPS3).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
