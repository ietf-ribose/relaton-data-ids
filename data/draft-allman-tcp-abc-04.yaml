abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a small modification to the way TCP increases
    its congestion window. Rather than the traditional method of increasing the congestion
    window by a constant amount for each arriving acknowledgment, the document suggests
    basing the increase on the number of previously unacknowledged bytes each ACK
    covers. This change improves the performance of TCP, as well as closes a security
    hole TCP receivers can use to induce the sender into increasing the sending rate
    too rapidly. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
