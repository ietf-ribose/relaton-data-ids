abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IP multicasting is expected to become essential technique for
    mobile\n   video services. As the mobility management is being covered with\n
    \  distributed manner, corresponding IP multicasting is also required to\n   fit
    the distributed manner. This document specifies IP multicasting\n   support method
    and procedures for distributed mobility architecture.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
