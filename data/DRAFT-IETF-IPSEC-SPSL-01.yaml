abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Security Policy Specification Language\n(SPSL),
    a language designed to express security policies, security\ndomains, and the entities
    that manage the policies and domains.  The\nsyntax and semantics of the language
    are presented here.  SPSL\ncurrently supports policies for packet filtering, IP
    Security (IPSec),\nand ISAKMP exchanges, however, it may easily be extended to
    express\nother types of policies.\n\t </p>\n      "
