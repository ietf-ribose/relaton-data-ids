abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The advent of IPv6 in addition to IPv4 makes hosts and servers
    dual-\nstack. SIP communications can be used in both environments but there \nis
    little understanding what will happen if some nodes are dual-stack \nwhile others,
    presently the majority, is IPv4 only enabled. This \ndocument describes some scenarios
    and associated issues when dual-\nstack users and servers try to communicate with
    IPv4 only hosts using \nSIP. It is not evident that interoperability is achieved,
    and if that \nis not the case, this would severely limit the usability of both
    SIP \nand IPv6. \n\t </p>\n      "
