abstract:
  content: "<p>There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETFmeetings
    regarding the suitability of translators (i.e. NAT-PT) asmechanisms for IPv4 to
    IPv6 transition. It has often been stated thatNAT-PT is not a mechanism to be
    recommended in general to solve theIPv6-IPv4 transition problem. There have also
    been discussionsregarding special scenarios where some form of translators could
    bedeployed if their use is documented appropriately. The aim of thisdraft is to
    document the rationale for using translators in 3GPP(Third Generation Partnership
    Project) networks for IPv6-only SIP-based IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services
    and to describe asolution to the problem.</p>"
