abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade attacks
    that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol. In particular, the TLS Feature
    extension may be used to mandate support for revocation checking features in the
    TLS protocol such as OCSP stapling. Informing clients that an OCSP status response
    will always be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the response
    is not stapled. This in turn prevents a denial of service attack that might otherwise
    be possible.</p>"
