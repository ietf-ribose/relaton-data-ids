abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the
    DSresource record (RR) for authentication of zone delegations. Thisdocument introduces
    an alternative resource record, DS2, whichsimilarly provides authentication of
    zone delegations. However, DS2provides a canonical signer name, for zones whose
    content may beduplicated with multiple owner names. The zone is signed by thecanonical
    signer, and the DS2 record allows for validation using thissigner name.Author's
