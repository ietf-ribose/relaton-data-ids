abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Home network design faces many challenges currently.  Two of
    them are\n   multi-homing and policy enforcement.  Different with other types
    of\n   networks, home network operators are usually not professional\n   technicians
    or geeks.  The problems we face are fundamentally related\n   with the poor semantics
    provided by current destination-based routing\n   protocol.\n\n   TwoD-IP routing
    protocol is a link state routing protocol that makes\n   routing decisions based
    on both destination and source addresses.\n   This document describes the mechanism
    for supporting flexible multi-\n   homing and policy routing across home networks.\n\n\t
