abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4.1(NFSv4.1)\n
    \  to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by\n   the
    NFSv4.1 server. This ability to bypass the server for data\n   access can increase
    both performance and parallelism, but requires\n   additional client functionality
    for data access, some of which is\n   dependent on the class of storage used,
    a.k.a. the Layout Type. The\n   main pNFS operations and data types in NFSv4 Minor
    version 1 specify\n   a layout-type-independent layer; layout-type-specific information
    is\n   conveyed using opaque data structures whose internal structure is\n   further
    defined by the particular layout type specification. This\n   document specifies
    the NFSv4.1 Lustre pNFS Layout Type as a\n   companion to the main NFSv4 Minor
    version 1 specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
