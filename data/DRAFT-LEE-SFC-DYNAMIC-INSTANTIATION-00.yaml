abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SFC instantiation may be static or dynamic.  In a static\n
    \  instantiation, specific SF instances are predetermined by network\n   operator's
    configuration or policy.  However, since it does not\n   consider the current
    state of network resources such as availability\n   of the SF instances, the static
    instantiation may create more\n   vulnerable SFPs to state changes of the network
    resources such as\n   failure or overload.  This document specifies SFC dynamic\n
    \  instantiation capability to create and update SFPs considering\n   traffic
    optimization, failover of SFIs, and load balancing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
