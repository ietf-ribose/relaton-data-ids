abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a link relation type and media types for
    working with sets of links. Using this link relation type and/or the media types
    is useful when it becomes necessary to represent links outside the context of
    a resource they are linking. One typical example are scenarios in which the number
    of links to put in an HTTP Link header field is too big, and thus these links
    should become a resource of their own.</p>"
