abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
    format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines
    two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC3339 time) and tag 1 (Posix time [TIME_T], int
    or float). Since then, additional requirements have become known. The present
    document defines a CBOR tag for time that allows a more elaborate representation
    of time, and anticipates the definition of related CBOR tags for duration and
    time period. It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration
    of the CBOR tags defined.</p>"
