abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can\n
    \  help save network resource and useful in scenarios such as LSP\n   recovery
    or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time.\n   A Path Computation
    Element (PCE) is a centralized entity,\n   responsible for path computation. Given
    this feature and its access\n   to the network resource information and possibly
    active LSPs\n   information, it can be used to support resource-sharing-based
    path\n   computation with better efficiency.\n\n   This document extends the Path
    Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)\n   in order to support resource sharing-based
    path computation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
