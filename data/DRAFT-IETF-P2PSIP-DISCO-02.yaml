abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference\n
    \  Control (DisCo) with SIP.  DisCo preserves conference addressing\n   through
    a single SIP URI by splitting its semantic of identifier and\n   locator using
    a new Kind data structure.  Conference members are\n   enabled to select conference
    controllers based on proximity awareness\n   and to recover from failures of individual
    resource instances.  DisCo\n   proposes call delegation to balance the load at
    focus peers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
