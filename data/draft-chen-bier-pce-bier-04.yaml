abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet
    formats with BIER as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]. BIER-TE forwards
    and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition
    of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies.BIER-TE
    Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE). This document specifies
    extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests
    and responses for the computation of paths for BIER-TE.</p>"
