abstract:
  content: "<p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). This document supplements to the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types defined
    in RFC 8006. The Footprint Types defined in this document can be used for Footprint
    objects as part of the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI)
    defined in RFC 8008. The defined Footprint Types are derived from requirements
    raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</p>"
