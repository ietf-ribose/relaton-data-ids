abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Internet Call Waiting (ICW) has recently become a standard'check-list'
    service offered by many Telecommunications providerssuch as Nortel and Lucent.
    While differing in many details, allthese schemes rely on the LEC provider ability
    to detect and signalthe 'busy-line' state. This signal triggers the execution
    of theservice logic that provides the desirable effect. As a result, theInternet
    Call Waiting is most meaningful when offered by LEC [6] butof limited interest
    for long-distance providers, such as AT&amp;T, MCI,etc. In the broader prospective,
    ICW may be considered a member ofthe class of services that manage incoming calls
    by making use of anInternet connection. Of special interest the Long Distance
    Providersis a specific subclass of services that 'by-passes' LEC; the purposeof
    this paper is to begin the discussion of what can be implementedwhen LEC services
    are either not available or not desirable. To thisend we introduce a service--Advance
    Internet Caller-ID DeliveryService--that comes 'close' to ICW and yet, does not
    rely on theterminating LEC. In addition, this service related to the PINT'click-to-dial'
    service and could make use of the PINT protocol. The rest of this document is
    as follows: Section 2 describes the service offered to the end Subscriber. Section
    3 describes the architecture requirements to support the Advance Intenet Calle-ID
    Delivery Service. Section 4 descibes the call flows for typical scenarios. Sections
    5 and 6 respectively supply referneces and provide the author address.</p>"
