abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has emerged as the de-facto IoT standard for communication\n
    \  involving resource-constrained devices composing Low-power and Lossy\n   Networks
    (LLNs). CoAP mandates the adoption of the DTLS protocol to\n   secure unicast
    communication. However, in several IoT application\n   scenarios involving a group
    of multiple devices, the adoption of CoAP\n   multicast communication through
    IPv6 results in a number of\n   advantages, especially in terms of performance
    and scalability. Yet,\n   CoAP does not specify how to secure multicast group
    communication in\n   an interoperable way. This draft presents a method to secure\n
    \  communication in a multicast group, through an adaptation of the DTLS\n   record
    layer. In particular, group members rely on the same group\n   keying material
    in order to secure both request messages sent via\n   multicast and possible unicast
    messages sent as response. Since the\n   group keying material is provided upon
    joining the group, all group\n   members are not required to perform any DTLS
    handshake with each\n   other. The proposed method makes it possible to provide
    either group\n   authentication or source authentication of secured messages.\n\n\t
