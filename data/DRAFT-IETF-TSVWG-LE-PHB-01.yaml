abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a
    Lower\n   Effort (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB).  The primary objective of this LE\n
    \  PHB is to protect best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\n   the
    default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when\n   resources
    become scarce, best-effort traffic has precedence over LE\n   traffic and may
    preempt it.  There are numerous uses for this PHB,\n   e.g., for background traffic
    of low precedence, such as bulk data\n   transfers with low priority in time,
    non time-critical backups,\n   larger software updates, web search engines while
    gathering\n   information from web servers and so on.  This document recommends
    a\n   standard DSCP value for the LE PHB.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
