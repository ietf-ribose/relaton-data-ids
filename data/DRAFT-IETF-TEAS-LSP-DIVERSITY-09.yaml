abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Resource ReSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering provides
    support\n   for the communication of exclusion information during label switched\n
    \  path (LSP) setup. This document specifies two new diversity\n   subobjects
    for the RSVP eXclude Route Object (XRO) and the Explicit\n   Exclusion Route Subobject
    (EXRS). Three different mechanisms are\n   defined to accomplish LSP diversity
    in the provider or core network:\n   the signaled diversity type indicates whether
    diversity is based on\n   client, path computation engine (PCE), or network assigned\n
    \  identifiers.\n   The solution described in this document is based on the assumption\n
    \  that LSPs are requested sequentially, i.e., the time period between\n   the
    LSP setup requests for the two LSPs may be relatively long (in\n   the order of
    days, weeks, months). Re-routing the LSP that was\n   established first and may
    have existed for some time is not\n   considered.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
