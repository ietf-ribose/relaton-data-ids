abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a network component,\n   application,
    or node that is capable of performing path computations\n   at the request of
    Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  The PCE is\n   applied in Multiprotocol Label
    Switching Traffic Engineering\n   (MPLS-TE) networks and in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks to\n   determine the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) through the\n
    \  network.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\n   is
    specified for communications between PCCs and PCEs, and between\n   cooperating
    PCEs.\n\n   When computing or re-optimizing the routes of a set of LSPs through
    a\n   network it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in\n   order
    to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-\n   wide solutions.
    \ Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent\n   Optimization (GCO).  A
    Global Concurrent Optimization is able to\n   simultaneously consider the entire
    topology of the network and the\n   complete set of existing LSPs, and their respective
    constraints, and\n   look to optimize or re-optimize the entire network to satisfy
    all\n   constraints for all LSPs.  The Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO)\n
    \  application is primarily an NMS based solution.\n\n   This document provides
    application-specific requirements and the PCEP\n   extensions in support of a
    global concurrent optimization (GCO)\n   application.\n\t </p>\n      "
