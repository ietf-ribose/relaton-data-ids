abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the structure of the control messages
    that\n   were historically used with the Network Time Protocol before the\n   advent
    of more modern control and management approaches.  These\n   control messages
    have been used to monitor and control the Network\n   Time Protocol application
    running on any IP network attached\n   computer.  The information in this document
    was originally described\n   in Appendix B of RFC 1305.  The goal of this document
    is to provide a\n   current, but historic, description of the control messages
    as\n   described in RFC 1305 and any additional commands implemented in NTP.\n\n
    \  The publication of this document is not meant to encourage the\n   developement
    and deployment of these control messages.  This document\n   is only providing
    a current reference for these control messages\n   given the current status of
    RFC 1305.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
