abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To build IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses for IPv4/IPv6 translation,
    the \nWell-Known Prefix (WKP) and Network Specific Prefix (NSP)-based \naddress
    formats have been defined in [Address-Format]. However, both \nof them have some
    limitations in several use cases. Hence, this \ndocument aims at discussing the
    validity of the use cases and assess \nthe interest of the BEHAVE WG to meet the
    requirement of \nunambiguously distinguishing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses from
    \nnative IPv6 ones. Doing so would guide the address selection and \ntherefore
    allow avoiding crossing unnecessary or even useless \naddress family translators.
    \ \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
