abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In packet transport networks, there are requirements where
    reverse\n   unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same\n
    \  path as its forward unidirectional LSP.  This document describes how\n   RSVP
    Extended ASSOCIATION Object can be used to bind two co-routed\n   point-to-point
    unidirectional LSPs into an associated co-routed\n   bidirectional LSP in single-sided
    provisioning case.  The RSVP\n   REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint
    to trigger creation\n   of the reverse LSP along the same path as the forward
    LSP.\n   Fast-reroute procedures to ensure that the traffic flows on the\n   co-routed
    path after a failure event are also described.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
