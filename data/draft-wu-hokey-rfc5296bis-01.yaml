abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
    supporting multiple types of authentication methods. In systems where EAP is used
    for authentication, it is desirable to not repeat the entire EAP exchange with
    another authenticator. This document specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying
    hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication
    between the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator.
    The re-authentication server may be in the home network or in the local network
    to which the peer is connecting.</p>"
