abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic frameworksupporting
    multiple types of authentication methods. In systemswhere EAP is used for authentication,
    it is desirable to not repeatthe entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.
    This documentspecifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to supportan
    EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authenticationbetween the peer
    and an EAP re-authentication server through anyauthenticator. The re-authentication
    server may be in the homenetwork or in the local network to which the peer is
    connecting.</p>"
