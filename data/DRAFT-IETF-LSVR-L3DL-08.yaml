abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Massive Data Centers, BGP-SPF and similar routing protocols
    are\n   used to build topology and reachability databases.  These protocols\n
    \  need to discover IP Layer-3 attributes of links, such as neighbor IP\n   addressing,
    logical link IP encapsulation abilities, and link\n   liveness.  This Layer-3
    Discovery and Liveness protocol collects\n   these data, which may then be disseminated
    using BGP-SPF and similar\n   protocols.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
