abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines three types to be used in future AFS-3
    Rx\n   Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to represent time.  Current AFS-3 RPCs\n
    \  represent time as 32-bit integers representing seconds.  This is\n   insufficient
    in both granularity and range, so new types to represent\n   time are defined
    in this document to overcome these limitations.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n
    \  Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the\n   AFS-3
    protocol standardization mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as
    a recipient of any comments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
