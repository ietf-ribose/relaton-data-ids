abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
    DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the
    filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially
    if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document updates the
    EXTRA-TEXT field of Extended DNS Error to provide details on the DNS filtering.
    This information can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for
    other purposes. This document updates RFC 8914.</p>"
