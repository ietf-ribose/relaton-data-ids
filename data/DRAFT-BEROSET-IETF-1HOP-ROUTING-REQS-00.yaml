abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Wireless mesh routing for low cost wireless mesh devices can be
    done\nat a layer under IPv6.  This document examines the functional\nrequirements
    of this kind of routing and to explore why this approach\nmight be used in some
    contexts.  It should be noted that this kind of\nrouting is orthogonal to IP-level
    routing; there is no inherent\nconflict between the two.\n\t </p>\n      "
