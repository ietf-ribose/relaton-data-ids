abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet users currently cannot participate in wide-area
    IP\nmulticast sessions, because their first-hop routers (or beyond) do not\nsupport
    IP multicast routing.  We describe an application level\n(UDP-based) tunneling
    mechanism that allows non-multicast-connected\nusers - with no modification to
    their operating systems - to\nautomatically receive a large class of multicast
    sessions, pending the\ndeployment of multicast in their upstream routers.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
