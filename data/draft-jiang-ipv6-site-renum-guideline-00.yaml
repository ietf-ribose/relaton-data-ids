abstract:
  content: "<p>This document analyzes the existing issues for IPv6 site renumbering.It
    also analyzes the possible directions to solve these issues andgives recommendations.
    This document only takes the perspective ofnetwork and network protocols. Renumbering
    in IPv4 networks, in thedual-stack network or in the IPv4/IPv6 transition networks
    are out ofscope.This document only takes the perspective of network and networkprotocols.
    According to the different stages, these issues aredescribed in three categories:
    considerations during network design,considerations for routine network management,
    and considerationsduring renumbering operation. Recommended solutions or strategies
    arealso described. Issues that still remain unsolvable are listed as thefourth
    category.Although we list a few non-network issues in this document, weconsider
    them as issues that ISPs or network providers cannot affect.So, these issues are
    considered to be unsolvable and not explorefurther in these document, though they
    may be solved by OSimplementations or application implementations.We summary the
    requests that need to extend current protocols asfurther works at the end of this
    document.</p>"
