abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIPPING Working Group has developed requirements for session\n
    \  policy (including bandwidth and codec restrictions, logging, and\n   middlebox
    traversal), request history, and identity.  This document\n   discusses the pros
    and cons of allowing intermediaries to add SIP\n   message bodies to address these
    requirements.  It is intended to\n   provoke serious discussion rather than as
    a complete proposal.\n\t </p>\n      "
