abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme\n   needs
    to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping\n   resources for
    the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the\n   network after the failure.\n\n
    \  This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using\n   Resource
    Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   signaling in the context
    of GMPLS end-to-end recovery when using\n   restoration LSP where failed LSP is
    not torn down.  No new procedures\n   or mechanisms are defined by this document,
    and it is strictly\n   informative in nature.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
