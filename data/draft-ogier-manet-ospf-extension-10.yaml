abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies an extension of OSPF for IPv6 to supportmobile
    ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, isdesigned as a new
    OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR is basedon the selection of a subset
    of MANET routers, consisting of MANETDesignated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.
    The MDRs form a connecteddominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together
    form abiconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways.First,
    to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedureis used in which only
    (Backup) MDRs flood new LSAs back out thereceiving interface; reliable flooding
    is ensured by retransmittingLSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed
    only between(Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for muchbetter
    scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2-hopneighbor information
    provided in a Hello protocol extension. TheHello protocol is further optimized
    by allowing differential Hellosthat report only changes in neighbor states. Options
    are specifiedfor originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topologyinformation,
    allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising lesstopology information.</p>"
