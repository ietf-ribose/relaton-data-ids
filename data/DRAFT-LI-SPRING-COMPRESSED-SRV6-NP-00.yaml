abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging
    a\n   new type of Routing Extension Header, called Segment Routing\n   Header(SRH).
    \ However, the overhead introduced by SRH may be a\n   challenge for the current
    hardware capability, which would have much\n   effect on the forwarding performance
    and the payload efficiency.\n\n   This document defines a compressed SRv6 network
    programming mechanism\n   in order to reduce the overhead of SRv6 by introducing
    the Compressed\n   Segment Identifier(C-SID) and the Compressed SRH(C-SRH).  The
    C-SRH\n   can be a new Routing Header or an enhancement of SRH, which is\n   compatible
    with SRH well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
