abstract:
- content: "<p>The SPIRITS physical architecture and the relevant background explanation
    of the mechanism for interactions between the PSTN and SPIRITS are provided in
    [1]. This document is attempted to take a next step and to describe all the SPIRITS
    interfaces necessary to support the following services defined in the WG charter:
    Internet Call Waiting (the leading SPIRITS benchmark service), Internet Caller-ID
    Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding. The end-to-end implementation of charter
    services will require cooperation with ITU-T on the total protocol development.
    To this end this draft raises the discussion of the 'ownership' of protocols per
    SPIRIT interface.</p>"
