abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The SPIRITS physical architecture and the relevant backgroundexplanation
    of the mechanism for interactions between the PSTN andSPIRITS are provided in
    [1]. This document is attempted to take anext step and to describe all the SPIRITS
    interfaces necessary tosupport the following services defined in the WG charter:
    InternetCall Waiting (the leading SPIRITS benchmark service), InternetCaller-ID
    Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding. The end-to-endimplementation of charter
    services will require cooperation withITU-T on the total protocol development.
    To this end this draftraises the discussion of the 'ownership' of protocols per
    SPIRITinterface.</p>"
