abstract:
- content: "<p>Data centers are critical components of the infrastructure used by
    network operators to provide services to their customers. Data centers are attached
    to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway routers. One data center typically
    has more than one gateway for commercial, load balancing, and resiliency reasons.
    Segment Routing is a protocol mechanism that can be used within a data center,
    and also for steering traffic that flows between two data center sites. In order
    that one data center site may load balance the traffic it sends to another data
    center site, it needs to know the complete set of gateway routers at the remote
    data center, the points of connection from those gateways to the backbone network,
    and the connectivity across the backbone network. Other sites, such as access
    networks, also need to be connected across backbone networks through gateways.
    This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
    to allow each gateway router to advertise the routes to the prefixes reachable
    in the site to which it provides access, including advertising them on behalf
    of each other gateway to the same site.</p>"
