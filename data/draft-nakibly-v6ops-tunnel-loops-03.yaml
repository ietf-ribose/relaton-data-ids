abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in-IPv4
    automatic tunnels. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker totake advantage of
    inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6routing state and the native IPv6
    routing state. The attack forms arouting loop which can be abused as a vehicle
    for trafficamplification to facilitate DoS attacks. The first aim of thisdocument
    is to inform on this attack and its root causes. The secondaim is to present some
    possible mitigation measures.</p>"
