abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a file system federation protocol that
    enables file access and\nnamespace traversal across collections of independently
    administered fileservers. The\nprotocol specifies a set of interfaces by which
    fileservers and collections of\nfileservers with different administrators can
    form a fileserver federation that\nprovides a namespace composed of the filesystems
    physically hosted on and exported by\nthe constituent fileservers.\n\n\t </p>\n
