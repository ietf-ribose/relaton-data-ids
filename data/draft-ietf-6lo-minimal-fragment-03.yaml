abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a simple method to forwarding 6LoWPAN fragments.
    When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be beneficial
    for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in its entirety before forwarding
    it. This has always been possible with the original fragmentation design of RFC4944.
    This method reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability in route-over
    forwarding. It is the companion to the virtual Reassembly Buffer which is a pure
    implementation technique.</p>"
