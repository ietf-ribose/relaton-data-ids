abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates requirements for IPv6 Destination and Hop-by-
    Hop Options. The requirements that option type and option length cannot change
    en route, as well as the requirements that options cannot be added or removed,
    are made explicit. The meaning and requirements of a Destination Option marked
    as changeable are clarified. Finally, the requirement that all destinations listed
    in a Routing header must process options in a Destination Options header preceding
    the Routing header is relaxed.</p>"
