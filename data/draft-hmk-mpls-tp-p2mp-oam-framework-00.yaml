abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
    carrier-grade packet transport. This document provides texts proposal which should
    be discussed and included in draft-fbb-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework, particularly focusing
    on p2mp OAM framework in case that return paths don't exist. Other requirements
    of p2mp transport path such as protection will also be discussed. Note: This I-D
    was made based on the result of discussion in ITU-T SG15 which is described in
    a Liaison Statement: Request advance work on the p2mp framework in MPLS-TP (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1163/)
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
    International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network.</p>"
