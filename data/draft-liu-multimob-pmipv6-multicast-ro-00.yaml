abstract:
- content: "<p>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has issued
    several proposals including the base solution,dedicated schemes and direct routing
    which requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor(LMA),the
    dedicated server and the native multicasting infrastructure ,respectively. As
    this can be suboptimal, localized routing (LR) allows multicast source attached
    to the same or different mobile access gateways(MAG) with mobile node to send
    multicast data by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways
    without any dedicated devices or dependence of the native multicasting infrastructure.
    This document describes multicast routes optimazition mechanisms for localized
    routing.The MAG and the LMA are the mobility entities defined in the PMIPv6 protocol
    and act as PIM-SM routers.</p>"
