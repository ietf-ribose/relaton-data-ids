abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE Std 802.16 is an air interface specification for fixed and mobile
    Broadband Wireless Access Systems. Service-specific convergence sublayers to which
    upper-layer protocols interface are a part of the IEEE 802.16 MAC (Medium Access
    Control). The Packet convergence sublayer (CS) is used for the transport of all
    packet- based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.3 LAN/MAN
    CSMA/CD Access Method (Ethernet). IPv6 packets can be sent and received via the
    IP-specific part of the Packet CS. This document specifies the addressing and
    operation of IPv6 over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS for hosts served
    by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface. It recommends the
    assignment of a unique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows the host to
    use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated
    interface identifiers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
