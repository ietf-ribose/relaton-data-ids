abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an overlay network use case for interface to
    routing system (I2RS). The forwarding routers network is assumed to be an overlay
    structure. There are two types of forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core
    Routers(CR). Edge Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which
    are established among Edge Routers. Core Router would be very simple and cheap.
    CRs focus on the encapsulation data forwarding. In order to reduce the overall
    ER costs, the use of network virtualization is proposed in this document.</p>"
