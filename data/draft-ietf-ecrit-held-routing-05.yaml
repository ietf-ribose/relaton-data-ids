abstract:
- content: "<p>For cases where location servers have access to emergency routing information,
    they are able to return routing information with the location information if the
    location request includes a request for the desired routing information. This
    document specifies an extension to the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol
    that updates RFC 5985 to support this function. Allowing location and routing
    information to be acquired in a single request response exchange updates RFC 6881,
    as current location acquisition and route determination procedures are separate
    operations.</p>"
