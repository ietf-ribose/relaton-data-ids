abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a method of the Authentication and\n
    \  Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, which\n   allows
    an Authorization Server to notify Clients and Resource Servers\n   (i.e., registered
    devices) about revoked Access Tokens.  The method\n   relies on resource observation
    for the Constrained Application\n   Protocol (CoAP), with Clients and Resource
    Servers observing a Token\n   Revocation List on the Authorization Server.  Resulting
    unsolicited\n   notifications of revoked Access Tokens complement alternative\n
    \  approaches such as token introspection, while not requiring\n   additional
    endpoints on Clients and Resource Servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
