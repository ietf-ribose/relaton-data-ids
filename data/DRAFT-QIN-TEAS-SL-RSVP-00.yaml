abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RSVP takes a \"soft state\" scheme to manage the reservation
    states in\n   routers and hosts, the soft states are created and periodically\n
    \  refreshed by Path and Resv messages.  Soft state scheme gives a\n   simple
    way to maintain the state synchonization between neighbors,\n   but also introduces
    scalability issue.  This document provides a\n   framework that describes and
    discusses the architecture for stateless\n   RSVP (SL-RSVP), which disabled the
    soft-state scheme to improve the\n   protocol scalability and the other processes
    of RSVP are kept.  This\n   document does not describe specific protocols or protocol
    extensions\n   needed to realize this architecture.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
