    \  (QoS) function for the Internet Protocol, and is the product of an ad\n   hoc
    Internet 2 working group meeting held August 25-27, 1997 hosted\n   by Cisco Systems,
    Inc. This document is offered to the IP community\n   for its consideration and
    comments.\n \n   This document is organized as follows: Section 1 proposes a simple\n
    \  classification scheme to describe QoS models. Subsequent sections\n   discuss
