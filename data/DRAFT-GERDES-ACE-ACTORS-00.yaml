abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms
    of\n   processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   This document defines
    actors in the security architecture for\n   authentication and authorization,
    analyzes the relationships between\n   them, and describes their respective tasks
    and characteristics.  This\n   knowledge will then be used to derive requirements
    for the\n   communication between the actors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
