abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes VP9, a video codec being developed\n
    \  specifically to meet the demand for the consumption of video over the\n   Internet,
    including professionally and amateur produced video-on-\n   demand and conversational
    video content.  VP9 is an evolution of the\n   VP8 video codec that is described
    in [bankoski-rfc6386] and includes\n   a number of enhancements and new coding
    tools that have been added to\n   improve the coding efficiency.  The new tools
    that have been added so\n   far include: larger prediction block sizes up to 64x64,
    various forms\n   of compound INTER prediction, more modes for INTRA prediction,\n
    \  &amp;#8539;-pel motion vectors, 8-tap switchable sub-pixel interpolation\n
    \  filters, improved motion reference generation, improved motion vector\n   coding,
    improved entropy coding including frame-level entropy\n   adaptation for various
    symbols, improved loop filtering, the\n   incorporation of the Asymmetric Discrete
    Sine Transform (ADST),\n   larger 16x16 and 32x32 DCTs, and improved frame level
    segmentation.\n   VP9 is under active development and this document provides only
    a\n   snapshot of the current state of the coding tools as they exist\n   today.
    \ The finalized version of the VP9 bitstream may differ\n   considerably from
    the description contained herein and may encompass\n   the exclusion or modification
    of existing coding tools or the\n   addition of new coding tools.\n\n\t </p>\n
