abstract:
  content: "<p>Link State PDU flooding rates in use are much slower than what modern
    networks can support. The use of IS-IS at larger scale requires faster flooding
    rates to achieve desired convergence goals. This document discusses issues associated
    with increasing flooding rates and some recommended practices which allow faster
    flooding rates to be used safely.</p>"
