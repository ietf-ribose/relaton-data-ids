abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL uses distribution trees for multi-destination traffic.
    Multiple\n   trees can be used by an ingress RBridge. Different ingress RBridges\n
    \  may choose different distribution trees for the same VLAN and/or\n   multicast
    group traffic. Distribution trees are normally pruned based\n   on VLAN. For any
    RBridge RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers of VLAN\n   x in a distribution tree
    t, there will be an entry of (t, x, port\n   list) in the multicast forwarding
    table on RBn. If there are n trees\n   and m VLANs, the multicast forwarding table
    size on RBn is typically\n   n*m entries. The value of m is up to 4096 and n is
    the total number\n   of distribution trees in the campus. If finer granularity
    filtering\n   such as L2/L3 multicast address is used, then the multicast\n   forwarding
    table size further increases dramatically. TRILL multicast\n   forwarding table
    size is limited by hardware and L3 multicasting may\n   share the same table with
    it in hardware implementations. Therefore\n   multicast table entry is a precious
    resource. This document specifies\n   a VLAN based tree selection mechanism to
    reduce the TRILL multicast\n   forwarding table size. No data plane change is
    required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
