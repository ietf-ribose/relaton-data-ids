abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes Open Shortest Path First - Traffic\n
    \  Engineering (OSPF-TE) routing protocol extensions to support GMPLS\n   control
    of Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) specified in ITU-T\n   Recommendation G.709
    published in 2016.  The 2016 version of G.709\n   [ITU-T_G709_2016] introduces
    support for higher rate OTU signals,\n   termed OTUCn (which have a nominal rate
    of 100n Gbps).  The newly\n   introduced OTUCn represent a very powerful extension
    to the OTN\n   capabilities, and one which naturally scales to transport any newer\n
    \  clients with bit rates in excess of 100G, as they are introduced.\n   This
    document extends the mechanisms defined in [RFC7138].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
