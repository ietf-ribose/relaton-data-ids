abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   New services such as virtual networks, service function chaining,\n
    \  and application-centric traffic steering bring new opportunities for\n   network
    providers and service providers. With these new services,\n   the interactions
    between applications and networks are becoming more\n   critical in order to achieve
    satisfactory QoS, reliability, and\n   security, which are tailored to each specific
    application.\n   Application-based Policy for Network Function (APONF) is designed
    to\n   facilitate these interactions. This internet draft describes some\n   use
    cases that show how APONF may be deployed to support these\n   services.\n\n\t
