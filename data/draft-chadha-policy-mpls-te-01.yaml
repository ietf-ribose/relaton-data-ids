abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model forrepresenting
    MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702,'Requirements for Traffic Engineering
    over MPLS', is used as a basisfor determining the types of information that need
    to be representedin such an information model. The latter document describes thefunctional
    capabilities required to implement policies thatfacilitate efficient and reliable
    network operations in an MPLSdomain. The information model described in this draft
    attempts tocapture the information required to enable the functionalcapabilities
    described in RFC 2702. This information model could beused by a management system
    to optimize network performance throughthe necessary network provisioning actions.An
    overview of policy-based management is given in this document,along with a description
    of the relationship of this work to otherinformation models that are being defined
    in the IETF PolicyFramework working group. This is followed by a detailed descriptionof
    the information model, and a number of examples illustrating itsuse.</p>"
