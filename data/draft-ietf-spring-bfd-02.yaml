abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages the paradigm of source
    routing. It can be realized in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network
    without any change to the data plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label, and
    an ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor any existing path between systems. This
    document defines how to use Label Switched Path Ping to bootstrap a BFD session,
    control an SR Policy in the reverse direction of the SR-MPLS tunnel, and applicability
    of BFD Demand mode in the SR-MPLS domain. Also, the document describes the use
    of BFD Echo with BFD Control packet payload.</p>"
