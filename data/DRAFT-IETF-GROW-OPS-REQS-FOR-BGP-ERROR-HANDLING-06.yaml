abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP is utilised as a key intra- and inter-autonomous system
    routing\n   protocol in modern IP networks.  The failure modes, as defined by
    the\n   original protocol standards, are based on a number of assumptions\n   around
    the impact of session failure.  Numerous incidents both in the\n   global Internet
    routing table and within service provider networks\n   have been caused by strict
    handling of a single invalid UPDATE\n   message causing large-scale failures in
    one or more autonomous\n   systems.\n\n   This memo describes the current use
    of BGP within service provider\n   networks, and outlines a set of requirements
    for further work to\n   enhance the mechanisms available to a BGP implementation
    when\n   erroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document does not provide\n
    \  specification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a set\n   of
    enhancements to BGP to improve the protocol's robustness to suit\n   its current
    deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
