abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) is deprecated. Accordingly,
    IKEv1 has been moved to Historic status. A number of old algorithms that are associated
    with IKEv1, and not widely implemented for IKEv2 are deprecated as well. IANA
    is instructed to close all IKEv1 registries.</p>"
