abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document establishes the link between the Internet architecture\n
    \  and the ability of people to exercise their right to freedom of\n   assembly
    and association online.  The Internet increasingly mediates\n   our lives, our
    relationships and our ability to exercise our human\n   rights.  As a forum, it
    provides a global public space despite being\n   built on predominantly private
    infrastructure.  Since Internet\n   protocols play a central role in the management,
    development and use\n   of the Internet, the relation between protocols and the\n
    \  aforementioned rights should be analyzed and any adverse impacts\n   should
    be mitigated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
