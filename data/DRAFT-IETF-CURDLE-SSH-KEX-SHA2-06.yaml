abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document adds recommendations for adoption of ssh-curves
    from\n   the [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves] and new-modp from the\n   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2],
    and deprecates some previously\n   specified Key Exchange Method algorithm names
    for the Secure Shell\n   (SSH) protocol.  It also updates [RFC4253], [RFC4419],
    [RFC4462], and\n   [RFC5656] by specifying the set key exchange algorithms that\n
    \  currently exist and which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be\n   implemented.
    \ New key exchange methods use the SHA-2 family of\n   hashes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
