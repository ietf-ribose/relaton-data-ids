abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general
    term\n   that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for\n
    \  performance measurement. Over the years various OAM tools have been\n   defined
    for various layers in the protocol stack.\n\n   This document summarizes some
    of the data plane OAM tools defined in\n   the IETF in the context of IP unicast,
    MPLS, pseudowires, MPLS for\n   the transport profile (MPLS-TP), and TRILL.\n\n
    \  The target audience of this document includes network equipment\n   vendors,
    network operators and standard development organizations,\n   and can be used
    as an index to some of the main data plane OAM tools\n   defined in the IETF.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
