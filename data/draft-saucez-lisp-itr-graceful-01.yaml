abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap mechanism
    to enable the communication between hosts identified with their Endpoint IDentifier
    (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not routable. To do so, packets toward
    EIDs are encapsulated in packets with routing locators (RLOCs) to form dynamic
    tunnels. An Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates EID packets determines
    tunnel endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to RLOCs. Before encapsulating
    a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system to obtain the mapping associated
    to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate. Such mapping is cached by the ITR
    in its local EID-to-RLOC cache for any subsequent encapsulation for the same EID.
    LISP is scalable because the EID-to-RLOC cache of an ITR, which is initially empty,
    is populated progressively according to the traffic going through the ITR. However,
    after an ITR is restarted, e.g., for maintenance reason, its cache is empty which
    means that all packets that are re- routed to the freshly restarted ITR will cause
    cache misses and a potentially high loss rate. In this draft, we present mechanisms
    to reduce the negative impact on traffic caused by the restart of an ITR in a
    LISP network.</p>"
