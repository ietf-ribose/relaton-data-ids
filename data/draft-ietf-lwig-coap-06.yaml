abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource-
    constrained nodes and networks such as sensor nodes in a low-power lossy network
    (LLN). Yet to implement this Internet protocol on Class 1 devices (as per RFC
    7228, ~ 10 KiB of RAM and ~ 100 KiB of ROM) also lightweight implementation techniques
    are necessary. This document provides lessons learned from implementing CoAP for
    tiny, battery-operated networked embedded systems. In particular, it provides
    guidance on correct implementation of the CoAP specification RFC 7252, memory
    optimizations, and customized protocol parameters.</p>"
