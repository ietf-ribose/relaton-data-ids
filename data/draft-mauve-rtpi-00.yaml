abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies RTP/I, an application level real-timeprotocol
    for distributed interactive media. Typical examples ofdistributed interactive
    media are shared whiteboards, networkedcomputer games and distributed virtual
    environments. RTP/I definesa standardized framing for the transmission of data
    and providesmechanisms that are universally needed for this media class.Thereby
    RTP/I enables the development of reusable functionality andgeneric services that
    can be employed for multiple distributedinteractive media. Examples for this kind
    of functionality are theability to record sessions, to support late coming participants,and
    to provide security services. RTP/I is a protocol that followsthe ideas of application
    level framing and integrated layerprocessing. It has been designed to be independent
    of theunderlying network and transport layers. To a large extend RTP/Ihas been
    inspired by the real-time transport protocol (RTP), whichis used for continuous
    non-interactive media.This document is intended to stimulate the discussion on
    how totransport distributed interactive media over the Internet. Thereexists an
    RTP/I mailing list. Instructions on how to subscribe tothis list can be found
    at the RTP/I homepage(http://www.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/informatik/pi4/projects/RTPI/index.html).
    Feedback on this document should be addressed to the RTP/I mailing list or directly
    to the authors.</p>"
