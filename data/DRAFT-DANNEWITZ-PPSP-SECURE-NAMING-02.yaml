abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Today, each application typically uses its own way to identify
    data.\nThe lack of a common naming scheme prevents applications from\nbenefiting
    from available copies of the same data distributed via\ndifferent P2P and CDN
    systems.  The main proposal presented in this\ndraft is idea that there should
    be a secure and application\nindependent way of naming information objects that
    are transported\nover the Internet.  The draft defines a set of requirements for
    such\na naming structure.  It also presents a proposal for such a naming\nstructure
    that could relevant for a number of work groups (existing\nand potential), e.g.
    \ PPSP, DECADE and CDNI.  In addition, today's\nP2P naming schemes lack important
    security aspects that would allow\nthe user to check the data integrity and build
    trust in data and data\npublishers.  This is especially important in P2P applications
    as data\nis received from untrusted peers.  Providing a generic naming scheme\nfor
    P2P systems so that multiple P2P systems can use the same data\nregardless of
    data location and P2P system increases the efficiency\nand data availability of
    the overall data dissemination process.  The\nsecure naming scheme is providing
    self-certification such that the\nreceiver can verify the data integrity, i.e.,
    that the correct data\nhas been received, without requiring a trusted third party.
    \ It also\nenables owner authentication to build up trust in (potentially\nanonymous)
    data publishers.  The secure naming structure should be\nbeneficial as potential
    design principle in defining the two\nprotocols identified as objectives in the
    PPSP charter.  This\ndocument enumerates a number of design considerations to
    impact the\ndesign and implementation of the tracker-peer signaling and peer-peer\nstreaming
    signaling protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
