abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The latest version of Multicast Listener Discovery protocol
    is\n   defined in RFC 3810, dated back in 2004, while the first version of\n   MLD,
    which is still in use and has not been deprecated, is defined in\n   RFC 2710
    and is dated back in 1999.  New security research has\n   exhibited new vulnerabilities
    in MLD, both remote and local attack\n   vectors.  This document describes those
    vulnerabilities and proposes\n   specific mitigation techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n
