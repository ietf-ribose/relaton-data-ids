abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses some operational aspects of publishing
    and using\n   DANE TLSA records.  Server operators need to consider whether the\n
    \  intended clients are able to authenticate the server's certificate\n   chain
    via the published TLSA records, some variations of TLSA records\n   may not work
    as expected in all cases.  Clients need to decide which\n   variations of TLSA
    records are sufficiently robust to be usable for\n   server authentication.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
