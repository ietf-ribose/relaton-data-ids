abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer\n
    \  reported problems and for regression testing if network or client\n   software
    is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP
    signaling will take between clients, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor
    SIP signaling end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes requirements for adding an
    indicator to the SIP\n   protocol data unit (PDU, or a SIP message) that marks
    the PDU as a\n   candidate for logging.  Such marking will typically be applied
    as\n   part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not\n   used
    in regular client signaling.  However, such marking can be\n   carried end-to-end
    including the SIP terminals, even if a session\n   originates and terminates in
    different networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
