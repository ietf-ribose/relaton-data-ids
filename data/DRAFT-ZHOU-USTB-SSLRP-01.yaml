abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Secure and Scalable Location Routing Protocol (SSLRP) is a
    secure\n  and distributed routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks of\n  mobile
    nodes with location information. Commonly, each node\n  acquires its own geographic
    position using a mechanism such as the\n  Global Position System (GPS).\n  \n
    \ The SSLRP addresses each node using the hybrid of its multi-level\n  hierarchical
    address and unique identifier at the moment of network \n  initialization.\n  \n
    \ Certain measures were adopted to ensure security of the network.\n\t </p>\n
