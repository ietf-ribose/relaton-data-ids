abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the\n
    \  Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol to\n   control
    the Forwarding Element Manager (FEM) by creating a Logical\n   Functional Block
    (LFB) to represent its functionality, the FE\n   Configuration (FEC) LFB . A Control
    Element (CE) that controls a\n   Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can also
    manage its configuration\n   via the FEC LFB.  On a running FE, the CE may update
    the FE's runtime\n   configuration via an FEC LFB e.g., by adding a new CE and
    its\n   associated IP address).  Additionally, in the case where we have a\n   resource
    pool of FEs, the FEC may be used to initiate an FE into the\n   Network Element
    cluster.  This document introduces the FEC LFB, an\n   LFB that specifies the
    configuration parameters of an FE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
