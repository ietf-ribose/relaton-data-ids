abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies use cases, derived functional capabilities,\n
    \  and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating\n   interoperable
    automation tools and continuous monitoring solutions\n   that provide visibility
    into the state of endpoints, user activities,\n   and network behavior.  Stakeholders
    will be able to use these tools\n   to aggregate and analyze relevant security
    and operational data to\n   understand the organizations security posture, quantify
    business\n   risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational\n   objectives
    while protecting critical information.  Organizations will\n   be able to use
    these tools to augment and automate information\n   sharing activities to collaborate
    with partners to identify and\n   mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will
    be able to integrate\n   with these capabilities to enforce policies based on
    human decisions\n   to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack\n
    \  surface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
