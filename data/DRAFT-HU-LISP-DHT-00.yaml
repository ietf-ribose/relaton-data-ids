abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a DHT based distributed EID-to-RLOC mapping\nmethod.
    \ The distributed EID-to-RLOC mapping is stored in an overlay,\nwhich is different
    from the data forwarding plane, and made up by DHT\nrings.  The DHT based overlay
    is deployed in an AS, and the inter-AS\ncommunication is through DHT Border Server,
    which in located in the\nborder of DHT rings.  The DHT Border Server is used to
    flood the\ncross routing and forward the cross domain data packet.  The DHT\nbased
    Distributed mapping system is a hybrid push and pull method.\n\t </p>\n      "
