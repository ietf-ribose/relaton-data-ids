abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification addresses the challenges of using JavaScript\n
    \  Object Notation (JSON) with constrained devices by providing a\n   standard
    set of mapping rules to Concise Binary Object Representation\n   (CBOR) that preserve
    all semantic information, such that the original\n   JSON string can be identically
    re-created.  JSON Constrained Notation\n   can also be used by devices as a native
    data format, which can then\n   be represented as JSON when necessary for diagnostics,
    compatibility,\n   and ease of integration with higher-level systems.\n\n\t </p>\n
