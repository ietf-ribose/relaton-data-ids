abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes how to achieve media-independent pre-authentication
    (MPA) in the context of network accesses protected byIPsec. In such environments,
    access is protected by an IPsec tunnelmode security association (SA) established
    between a client of thenetwork and an access gateway. This SA normally needs to
    beestablished by running an IKE exchange between the two SA endpoints.The duration
    of this IKE exchange make it impractical to use when thenode is mobile and frequently
    change either its location or itsaccess gateway during a handover. In most case
    it is expected thatreal time traffic will be impacted by the handover. This notedescribes
    a method that alleviate this issue by leveraging on theIKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming
    Protocol (MOBIKE). The describedmethod supresses the need to run a full IKE exchange
    after eachhandover, thereby greatly reducing the impacts of handovers on real-time
    traffic.</p>"
