abstract:
- content: "<p>This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing information about the
    party to be charged. This P-Header is currently in production usage by a number
    of equipment vendors and carriers and this document is submitted to request the
    registration of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also be used in some
    situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN interconnection.
    NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008 under the name draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.
    This -04 document is identical to draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for
    edits to the text to indicate this is now for the DISPATCH working group as the
    SIPPING working group no longer exists.</p>"
