abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an architecture framework for achievingconverged
    mobile services across alternative radio access networks(GAN, or Generic Access
    Network), such as WLAN, WiMax, and thecellular network, while utilizing SIP for
    media session controlbetween the dual mode handset (DMH) and a network SIP proxy.
    The keybenefits of this architecture include (1) fast and flexible servicedeployment
    in the IP domain, and (2) allow seamless voice callcontinuity services across
    IP and circuit-switched cellular domains.</p>"
