abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing paths\n   in SR networks.\n\n   Stateful PCE provide
    active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a\n   model where the PCC delegates
    control over one or more locally\n   configured LSPs to the PCE.  Further, stateful
    PCE could also create\n   and delete PCE-initiated LSPs itself.  A PCE-based central
    controller\n   (PCECC) simplify the processing of a distributed control plane
    by\n   blending it with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and\n   without
    necessarily completely replacing it.\n\n   In some use cases, such as PCECC, Binding
    Segment Identifier (SID)\n   for Segment Routing (SR), there are requirements
    for a stateful PCE\n   to make allocation of labels, SIDs, etc.  These use cases
    require for\n   a PCE to be aware of the various identifier space from which to
    make\n   allocations on behalf of PCC.  This documents specify a mechanism for\n
    \  a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier space under its control via\n   PCEP.
    \ The identifier could be MPLS label, SID or another future\n   identifier to
    be allocated by a PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
