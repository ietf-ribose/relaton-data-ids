abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs), are assigned as part of
    the\n   technical protocol parameters and are frequently used in the\n   management
    of network connected equipment or software via SNMP-based\n   network management
    systems, LDAP, DIAMETER or GSS-API.  This document\n   discusses what a Private
    Enterprise Number (PEN) is, common uses and\n   registration procedures.  The
    registration procedures include\n   instructions for obtaining a new Private Enterprise
    Number,\n   modification to existing numbers and removal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
