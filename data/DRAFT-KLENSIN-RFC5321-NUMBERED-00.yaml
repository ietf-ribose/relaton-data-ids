abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>20\n  This document is a specification of the basic protocol for
    Internet\n21\n  electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies\n22\n
    \ several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them\n23\n  obsolete.
    \ It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices\n24\n  for the contemporary
    Internet, but does not provide details about\n25\n  particular extensions.  Although
    SMTP was designed as a mail\n26\n  transport and delivery protocol, this specification
    also contains\n27\n  information that is important to its use as a \"mail submission\"\n28\n
    \ protocol for \"split-UA\" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile\n29\n
    \ environments.\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n58  Internet-Draft\n\n
    \ RFC5321-Numbered\n\n\n\n\nDec 2008\n\t </p>\n      "
