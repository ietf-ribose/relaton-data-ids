abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   I2RS intends to be a standard, programmatic interface to the
    routing\n   system that guides traffic in the network.  A well designed Traffic\n
    \  Steering (TS) solution can fully use the network bandwidth, reduce\n   the
    network congestion and satisfy the performance (e.g., delay,\n   loss) requirement
    of applications.  Most of the existing TS solutions\n   need human intervention
    and are lack of dynamic feedback and self-\n   adjust ability.  This document
    describes use cases that leverage the\n   I2RS interface to perform traffic steering
    dynamically and\n   automatically.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
