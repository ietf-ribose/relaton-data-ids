abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft, WCMT-SCTP(WCMT:Wireless Concurrent Multi-path \nTransfer)is
    proposed to allow a host to improve the transmission \nthroughput in wireless
    multi-hop networks using simultaneous multi-\npath transmission of Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol. Relevant  issues of WCMT-SCTP included are: (1) data transmission
    mode and path \nselection, (2) path management and, (3) multi-path handover mechanism.
    \nTransmission modes of WCMT-SCTP, and the path handover mechanism, are \ndesigned
    to enhance the transmission throughput and solve the receive \nbuffer blocking
    problem of different wireless link status. Since the \ntransmission paths used
    for WCMT-SCTP may differ when an WCMT-SCTP \nhost moves, the multi-path handover
    problem is defined, and a \nhandover mechanism is proposed. \n\t </p>\n      "
