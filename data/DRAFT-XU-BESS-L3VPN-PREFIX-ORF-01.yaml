abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type
    for\n   BGP, refered to as \"L3VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", that\n
    \  can be used to perform L3VPN address-prefix-based route filtering.\n   This
    ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-\n   card-based
    address prefix matching, as well as the exact address\n   prefix matching for
    L3VPN address families.  The L3VPN Address Prefix\n   ORF is applicable in the
    Virtual Subnet context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
