abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes extensions to SIP that enable a network
    of\ntrusted SIP servers to assert the identity of end users or end\nsystems, and
    to convey indications of end-user requested privacy.\nThe use of these extensions
    are only applicable inside an\nadministrative domain, or among federations of
    administrative domains\nwith previously agreed-upon policies for usage of such
    information.\nThis document does NOT offer a general privacy or identity model\nsuitable
    for inter-domain use or use in the Internet at large.\n\t </p>\n      "
