abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure in\nleadership
    roles is not in the best interests of the community.\nWhile, in theory, that advice
    could simply be given to the NomCom,\nthere is reason to believe that a different
    model for consideration\nof renewal or replacement for members of the leadership
    would be more\nefficient for the NomCom and would impose less hardship on incumbents\nand
    the community.  This document outlines that alternate method.\n\t </p>\n      "
