abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language)
    isimminent, and there is a user community eager to make use of the power-ful features
    it offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan ofaction is needed to assure
    a successful transition from the RIPE-181language currently employed to describe
    routing policies in the IRR tothe more expressive RPSL. This document describes
    such a plan, whichthe authors believe can be used to bring about a successful
    transitionin a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the IRR and its
    cur-rent role in Internet routing. This document will be modified toreflect the
    progress of the transition if appropriate.</p>"
