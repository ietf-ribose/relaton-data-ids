abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol which provides movbility
    support\n   for an ordinary IPv6 host in WiMAX network.  The protocol allows\n
    \  session continuity for every IPv6 node in WiMAX network as it moves\n   across
    subnets.  The protocol exploits the facts that a single prefix\n   is assigned
    per an IPv6 host in WiMAX network and prefix binding\n   scheme is defined in
    NEMO WG.  WiMAX access routers perform prefix\n   binding for the hosts' stead
    and the mobility is transparent to the\n   hosts inside WiMAX network.\n\n\t </p>\n
