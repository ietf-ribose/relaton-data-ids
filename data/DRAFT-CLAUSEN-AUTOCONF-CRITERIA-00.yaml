abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document gives a general set of objective criteria to
    evaluate\n   an autoconfiguration mechanism in a MANET environment.  All criteria\n
    \  are important to outline an evaluation of an autoconfiguration\n   mechanism.
    \ These criteria have been grouped into three classes:\n   functional criteria,
    performance criteria and usability criteria.\n   For each of the criteria, a description
    is outlined, hints are given\n   on how to perform an adequate measure of the
    criterium, and an\n   evaluation features the importance of the criterium in the
    full\n   evaluation of a mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
