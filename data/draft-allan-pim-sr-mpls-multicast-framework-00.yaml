abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a multicast solution for SR-MPLS. It is consistent
    with the Segment Routing architecture in that an IGP is augmented to distribute
    information in addition to the link state. In this solution it is multicast group
    membership information sufficient to synchronize state in a given network domain.
    Computation is employed to determine the topology of any loosely specified multicast
    distribution tree.</p>"
