    IPv6operations using RADIUS infrastructure. The RADIUS interactions takeplace
    when the Mobile Node attaches, authenticates and authorizes toa Proxy Mobile IPv6
    domain. Furthermore, this document also definesa RADIUS based interface between
    the Local Mobility Anchor and theRADIUS server for authorizing received initial
    Proxy Binding Updatemessages for the mobility service session. In addition to
    themobility session setup related RADIUS interaction, this documentdefines the
    baseline for both the Mobile Access Gateway and the LocalMobility Anchor generated
