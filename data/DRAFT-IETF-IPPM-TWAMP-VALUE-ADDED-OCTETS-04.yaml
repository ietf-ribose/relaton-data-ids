abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an extension to the TWAMP test protocol
    for\n   identifying and managing packet trains, which enables measuring\n   capacity
    metrics like the available path capacity, tight section\n   capacity and UDP delivery
    rate in the forward and reverse path\n   directions.\n\n   This memo contains
    the description of a working prototype. It does\n   not represent a consensus
    of the IETF community. The IETF community\n   is currently working on the problem
    statement and has not reached\n   consensus on the preferred method for measuring
    capacity metrics.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
