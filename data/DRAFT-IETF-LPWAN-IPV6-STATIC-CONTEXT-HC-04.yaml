abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation\n
    \  functionality for very low bandwidth networks.  These techniques are\n   especially
    tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks.\n\n   The Static Context
    Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of\n   flexibility when processing
    the header fields and must be used for\n   this kind of networks.  A common context
    stored in a LPWAN device and\n   in the network is used.  This context stores
    information that will\n   not be transmitted in the constrained network.  Static
    context means\n   that information stored in the context which describes field
    values,\n   does not change during packet transmission, avoiding complex\n   resynchronization
    mechanisms, incompatible with LPWAN\n   characteristics.  In most of the cases,
    IPv6/UDP headers are reduced\n   to a small identifier called Rule ID.  But sometimes
    the SCHC header\n   compression will not be enough to send the packet in one L2
    PDU, so\n   this document also describes a Fragmentation protocol that must be\n
    \  used when needed.\n\n   This document describes the generic compression/decompression\n
    \  mechanism and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers.  Similar mechanisms for\n   other
    protocols such as CoAP will be described in separate documents.\n   Moreover,
    this document specifies fragmentation and reassembly\n   mechanims for SCHC compressed
    packets exceeding the L2 PDU size and\n   for the case where the SCHC compression
    is not possible then the\n   IPv6/UDP packet is sent using the fragmentation protocol.\n\n\t
