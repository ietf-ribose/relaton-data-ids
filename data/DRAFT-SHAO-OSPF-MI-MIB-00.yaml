abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The OSPF MIB defined by the IETF (RFC 1850) was designed to work
    with\nonly one OSPF process/instance on a given router.\n\nIt currently doesn't
    offer a mechanism to access ospf mib obejects of\ndifferent instances.  For example,
    there is only a single\nospfRouterId object, not a table of them.\n\nIn order
    to handle multiple instances, RFC 4750 suggests that you use\nSNMPv3 contexts
    to provide per-instance views.  This document\nintroduces a way for OSPF MIB to
    support multiple instance, no mater\nin SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 contexts, by adding the
    object ospfProcId into\nevery OSPF MIB group.  According to the specified ospfProcId,
    other\nobejects in this OSPF instance can be accessed.\n\t </p>\n      "
