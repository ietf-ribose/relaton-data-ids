    and describes a proposed policy, procedure and control structure for the allocation
    of additional top-level domains. This memorandum discusses the issues surrounding
    additional top level domains (TLDs), qualification proposals for operating such
    a registry, and justifications for the positions expressed in this paper. The
    IETF, IANA, NEWDOM and related mailing lists are welcome to read, and comment,
    on this material. Presuming a consensus can be found within these audiences, the
