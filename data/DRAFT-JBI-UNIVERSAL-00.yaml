abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> IPv6 transition is becoming an important research topic recently.
    \ In\n   traditional architecture, transition mechanisms are closely connected\n
    \  with application, protocol stack, and network equipments.  This makes\n   the
    transition process very complicated, and increases the difficulty\n   of network
    management.  In this document, we present a new network\n   architecture called
    Univer6.  It uses IPv6 as a unified middle\n   layer,thus can adapt to various
    kinds of applications and network\n   equipments.  Univer6 will help provide a
    smooth transition towards\n   IPv6, simplify network management process, and accelerate
    the\n   development of IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
