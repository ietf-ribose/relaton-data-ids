abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Our protocol embeds a destination-driven feature into the on-demand
    \n   multicast structure building process of an existing multicast \n   protocol
    ODMRP (On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol), which is a \n   mesh-based multicast
    scheme and uses a forwarding group concept. The \n   design objective of destination-driven
    on-demand multicast routing \n   protocol (D-ODMRP) is to improve the multicast
    forwarding efficiency \n   for wireless Ad Hoc networks. To achieve this goal,
    the path to \n   reach a multicast destination is biased towards those paths passing
    \n   through another multicast destination. \n\t </p>\n      "
