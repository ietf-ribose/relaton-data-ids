abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a centralized DF Designated Forwarder election
    mechanism to be used between an SDN (Software Defined Network) controller and
    each PE (Provider Edge) device in an EVPN network. Such a mechanism overcomes
    some issues with the current standalone DF election defined in RFC 7432. A new
    BGP capability and an additional DF Election Result Route Type are specified to
    support this centralized DF election mechanism.</p>"
