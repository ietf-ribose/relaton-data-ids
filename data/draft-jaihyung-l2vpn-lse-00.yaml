abstract:
  content: "<p>LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) is a label switching technique fortransmission
    of Ethernet frame. The method offers not only L2VPNconnectivity but it also provides
    features for dynamic connectionestablishment and resource reservation. LSE does
    not requireadditional information fields other than 802.3 standard headerbecause
    it uses destination address and source address as labels. Asa result, compatibility
    with legacy Ethernet is maintained and itprovides label switching service from
    terminal to terminal.Equipments that support LSE are connected via Ethernet tunnel
    mergingtree or TLSP (Tunnel LSP) tree across legacy network equipment. Userterminals
    establish connections using modified ARP protocol. Use ofmerging tree structure
    helps reducing signaling overhead as well asimproving scalability of LSE network.
    LSE also provides unifiedmechanism for unicasting, multicasting and wireless terminal
    mobility.</p>"
