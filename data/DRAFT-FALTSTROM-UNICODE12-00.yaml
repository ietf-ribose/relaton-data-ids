abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.3.0 and
    Unicode\n   12.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and changes have\n
    \  been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by\n   the
    algorithm IDNA2008 specifies.  Although IDNA2008 allows adding\n   exceptions
    to the algorithm for backward compatibility; however, this\n   document does not
    add any such exceptions.  This document provides\n   the necessary tables to IANA
    to make its database consisstent with\n   Unicode 12.0.0.\n\n   To improve understanding,
    this document describes systems that are\n   being used as alternatives to those
    that conform to IDNA2008.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED AT TIME OF PUBLICATION AS AN RFC:\n\n
    \  This document is discussed on the i18nrp@ietf.org mailing list of the\n   IETF.\n\n\t
