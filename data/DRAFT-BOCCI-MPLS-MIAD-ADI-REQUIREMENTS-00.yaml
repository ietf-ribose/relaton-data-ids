abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS
    label\n   stack of ancillary data that exists below the label stack.  This work\n
    \  is the product of the IETF MPLS Open Design Team.  Requirements are\n   derived
    from a number of new proposals for additions to the MPLS\n   label stack to allow
    forwarding or other processing decisions to be\n   made, either by a transit or
    terminating LSR, based on application\n   data that may be in or below the bottom
    of the label stack.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
