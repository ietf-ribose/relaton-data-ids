abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For efficient Detecting Network Attachment (DNA), a host should\n
    \  quickly receive a Router Advertisement (RA) message upon a new link-\n   layer
    connection.  This draft presents a quick RA acquisition scheme\n   with the support
    of a link-layer entity, Point of Attachment (PoA).\n   Upon a new network attachment,
    the PoA may either trigger an Access\n   Router (AR) to immediately send an unicast
    RA, \"RA Triggering\" or\n   send such an RA for itself, \"RA Proxying\".  We
    may put \"RA\n   Triggering\" or \"RA Proxying\" functionality on a PoA to get
    the\n   optimized result without IPv6 standard change.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
