abstract:
- content: "<p>This document clarifies requirements for IPv6 routers with respect
    to the Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Options Extension Header. These requirements are applicable
    to all IPv6 routers, regardless of whether they maintain a strict separation between
    forwarding and control plane hardware. In this respect, this document updates
    RFC 2460 and RFC 7045. This document also describes forwarding plane procedures
    for processing the HBH Options Extension Header. These procedures are applicable
    to implementations that maintain a strict separation between forwarding and control
    plane implementations. The procedures described herein satisfy the above mentioned
    requirements by processing HBH Options on the forwarding plane to the greatest
    degree possible. If a packet containing HBH Options must be dispatched to the
    control plane, it is rate limited before dispatching. In order to comply with
    the requirements of this specification, implementations may execute the procedures
    described herein or any other procedures that result in compliant behavior.</p>"
