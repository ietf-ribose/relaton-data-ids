abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LEDBAT is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm\n
    \  that attempts to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end\n   path
    while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on the\n   path.  LEDBAT
    uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit\n   congestion that the flow
    itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is\n   designed for use by background bulk-transfer
    applications; it is\n   designed to be no more aggressive than TCP congestion
    control and to\n   yield in the presence of any competing flows when latency builds,\n
    \  thus limiting interference with the network performance of the\n   competing
    flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
