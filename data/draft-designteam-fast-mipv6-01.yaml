abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements to MIPv6 that enable
    mobile nodes to more quickly become connected at new points of attachment to the
    Internet. These protocol enhancements are intended to minimize the time during
    which the mobile node is unable to send or receive IPv6 packets (i.e., the handover
    latency).</p>"
