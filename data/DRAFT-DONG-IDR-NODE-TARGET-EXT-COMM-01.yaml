abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP has been used to distribute different types of routing
    and policy\n   information in the network.  In some cases, the information\n   distributed
    may be only intended for one or several particular\n   receiving BGP nodes in
    the network.  However, BGP does not have a\n   general mechanism for designating
    the receiving node of the routing\n   information.  This document defines a new
    type of BGP extended\n   community called \"Node Target\".  The mechanism of using
    the Node\n   Target extended community to steer BGP route distribution to\n   particular
    BGP nodes is specified.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
