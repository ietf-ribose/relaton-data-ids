abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions,
    but it\n   is not avoidable due to congestion or other unplanned network\n   outages.
    \ This is especially the case for IP multicast networks.  One\n   technique to
    recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded\n   delay for all the receivers
    is to duplicate the packets and send them\n   in separate redundant streams.  This
    document explains how RTP\n   streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP and
    RTP Control\n   Protocol (RTCP) rules.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
