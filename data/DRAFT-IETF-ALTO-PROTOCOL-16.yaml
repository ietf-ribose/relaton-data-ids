abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications using the Internet already have access to topology\n
    \  information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For\n   example,
    views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers\n   are available and
    can be practically downloaded to many application\n   clients.  What is missing
    is knowledge of the underlying network\n   topologies from the point of view of
    ISPs (henceforth referred as\n   Providers).  In other words, what a Provider
    prefers in terms of\n   traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.\n\n
    \  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides\n   network
    information (e.g., basic network location structure and\n   preferences of network
    paths) with the goal of modifying network\n   resource consumption patterns while
    maintaining or improving\n   application performance.  The basic information of
    ALTO is based on\n   abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified
    view,\n   yet enough information about a network for applications to\n   effectively
    utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of\n   the maps.\n\n   This
    document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.\n   Although the
    ALTO Service would primarily be provided by the network\n   service providers
    (e.g., Internet service providers), content service\n   providers and third parties
    could also operate an ALTO service.\n   Applications that could use this service
    are those that have a choice\n   to which end points to connect.  Examples of
    such applications are\n   peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.\n\n\n\t
