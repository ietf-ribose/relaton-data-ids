abstract:
- content: "<p>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provides a way to virtualize and abstract
    the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to third-party applications
    running in software. Applications can utilize a programmable interface to receive
    these virtual or abstract resources descriptions in a form that allows monitoring
    or manipulation of resources within the network. The Interface to the Routing
    System (I2RS) provides an interface directly to the routing System to monitor
    best paths to any destination or change routes in the routing information base
    (RIB) or MPLS Label Information Base (LIB). The I2RS interfaces may be combined
    with other interfaces to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES (RFC3746)), device
    configuration (NETCONF), or mid-level (peer-to-peer) (ALTO) system to create these
    virtual pathways. This document outlines how SDN networks can use the I2RS interface
    to implement an automated set of network services for the Virtual Connection on
    Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD). These systems provide service
    routing a better way to create paths within a hub and spoke environment, and provide
    service routing the ability to create pathways based on service.</p>"
