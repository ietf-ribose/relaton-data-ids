abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN)
    by the\n   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically\n
    \  tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term\n   \"localized
    routing\" refers to a method by which packets are routed\n   directly between
    an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node\n   (CN) without involving any
    LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,\n   it may be desirable to control the
    establishment of localized routing\n   sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domain by requiring\n   that the session be authorized.  This document specifies
    how to\n   accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
