abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a metric, based on the minimal longest ascending\nsubsequence
    (MLAS), which can be used to measure the level of\nreorderedness of a given single
    sequence of packets transmitted by one\nhost and received by a second. This metric
    enables reordering between\nsimilar packet flows to be compared across differing
    network\ntopologies. The draft goes on to provide a set of recommended\nparameters
    which can be used when attempting to consistently compare\nreordering, and highlights
    potential issues which should be taken into\naccount during measurement.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
