abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a simple voice stream multiplexing method
    which is\ndesigned to reduce the IP-UDP header overhead of RTP (real-time transport\nprotocol)
    streams and to decrease the number of packets in the end-to-end\ntransport functions.
    \ The proposed multiplexing method is to concatenate\nRTP packets destined for
    the same Internet Telephony Gateway (IP-GW) into\na single UDP packet.  The benefits
    of this method are that no new\nadditional headers are required and the current
    well-defined H.323 and\nRTP standards can be used.\n \nFurthermore, this method
    is a general RTP packet multiplexing method that\nis applicable not only to an
    IP-GW but also to other multiplexing\napplications, as well as trunking VoIP streams
    application with insertion\nand deletion of RTP streams on the way.\n\n\t </p>\n
