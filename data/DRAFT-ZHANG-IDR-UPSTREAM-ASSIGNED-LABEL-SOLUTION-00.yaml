abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The upstream-assigned label is used to identify the specific\n
    \  multicast flow.  In MVPN technology RFC6513, it says: \"This procedure\n   requires
    each egress PE to support a separate label space for every\n   other PE.  The
    egress PEs creates a forwarding entry for the\n   upstream-assigned MPLS label,
    allocated by the ingress PE, in this\n   label space.\"\n\n   In common scenario,
    the \"separate label space\" is planned by network\n   administrator in advance.
    \ For the stable network, the method of\n   allocating the separate label space
    is easy and practicable.  But\n   when the network changes dynamically, it is
    very hard to allocate the\n   separate label space in advance.  The planned label
    space is probably\n   insufficient.  That leads to collision when PE uses the
    common label\n   space to allocate upstream-assigned label.  Therefore we need
    a\n   flexible solution for the collision of upstream-assigned label in the\n
    \  dynamically changing network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
