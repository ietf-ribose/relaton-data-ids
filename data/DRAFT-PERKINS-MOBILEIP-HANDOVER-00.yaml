abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document identifies (OR BETTER: specifies) protocol enhancements\nthat
    enable mobile nodes to more quickly become connected at new\npoints of attachment
    to the Internet.  These protocol enhancements\nare intended to minimize the time
    during which the mobile node is\nunable to send or receive IPv6 packets (i.e.,
    the handover latency).\nMobile IPv6 is considered to be the base protocol, but
    Mobile\nIPv6 does not mandate any mechanism which gives assurances about\nminimizing
    the handover latency.  The protocol enhancements in this\ndocument should be considered
    as protocol enhancements to Mobile\nIPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
