abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure.\n
    \  However, wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth of several orders of\n   magnitude
    lower than wired networks.  Besides, wireless transmissions\n   are lossy by nature;
    the probability that a packet cannot be decoded\n   correctly by the receiver
    may be quite high.  In these conditions,\n   providing high reliability and a
    low delay is challenging.  This\n   document lists the requirements of the Operation,
    Administration, and\n   Maintenance (OAM) features recommended to construct a
    predictable\n   communication infrastructure on top of a collection of wireless\n
    \  segments.  This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-\n   offs
    for using OAM in wireless networks to achieve Service Level\n   Objectives (SLO).\n\n\t
