abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP
    peers\n   rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP\n
    \  extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are\n   often
    carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this\n   information.  EAP
    has provided a facility that protects tunnel\n   methods against man-in-the-middle
    attacks.  However, cryptographic\n   binding focuses on protecting the server
    rather than the peer.  This\n   memo explores attacks possible when the peer is
    not protected from\n   man-in-the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic\n
    \  binding, a new form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer\n   and
    server along with other mitigations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
