abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a
    push\n   service using the described technique.  This identification\n   information
    can be used by the push service to attribute requests\n   that are made by the
    same application server to a single entity.\n   This can used to reduce the secrecy
    for push subscription URLs by\n   being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific
    application\n   server.  An application server is further able include additional\n
    \  information the operator of a push service can use to contact the\n   operator
    of the application server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
