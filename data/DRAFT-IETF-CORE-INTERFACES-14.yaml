abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of Constrained RESTful Environments\n
    \  (CoRE) Link Format Interface Descriptions [RFC6690] applicable for\n   use
    in constrained environments.  These include the: Actuator,\n   Parameter, Read-only
    parameter, Sensor, Batch, Linked Batch and Link\n   List interfaces.\n\n   The
    Batch, Linked Batch and Link List interfaces make use of resource\n   collections.
    \ This document further describes how collections relate\n   to interfaces.\n\n
    \  Many applications require a set of interface descriptions in order\n   provide
    the required functionality.  This document defines an\n   Interface Description
    attribute value to describe resources\n   conforming to a particular interface.\n\n
    \  Editor's notes:\n\n   o  The git repository for the draft is found at https://github.com/\n\t
