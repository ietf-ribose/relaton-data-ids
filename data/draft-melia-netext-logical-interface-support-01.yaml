abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the hostoperating
    system. This semantic is available in all popularoperating systems and is used
    in various protocol implementations.The Logical Interface support is desirable
    on the mobile nodeoperating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging variousnetwork-based
    mobility management features such as inter-technologyhandoffs, multihoming and
    flow mobility support. This documentexplains the operational details of Logical
    Interface construct andthe specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide
    the physicalinterfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes.Furthermore,
    this document identifies the applicability of thisapproach to various link-layer
    technologies and analyses the issuesaround it when used in context with various
    mobility managementfeatures.</p>"
