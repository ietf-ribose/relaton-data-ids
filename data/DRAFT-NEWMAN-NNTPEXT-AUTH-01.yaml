abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     Although NNTP [NNTP] has traditionally provided public access
    to\n     newsgroups, it is often useful to use authentication to control\n     resource
    consumption as well as to create restricted-access\n     newsgroups.  The NNTP
    AUTHINFO command described here provides a\n     way to do this.\n\n\t </p>\n
