abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of
    new\n   services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many\n   Service
    Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the\n   subscriber network.
    \ This document describes a self-configuring home\n   router that is capable of
    operating in such an environment, and that\n   requires no user interaction to
    configure it.  Compliant with\n   draft-ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols
    in new ways\n   without the need for a routing protocol.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
