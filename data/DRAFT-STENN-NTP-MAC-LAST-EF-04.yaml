abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NTP packets can be authenticated by a Message Authentication
    Code\n   (MAC) if a MAC is present at the end of an NTP packet.  The legacy\n
    \  format for this MAC is not formatted as an NTP Extension Field, and\n   its
    presence may cause some implementations a parsing ambiguity.\n\n   This proposal
    introduces two ways to resolve this problem.  One is to\n   provide a MAC Extension
    Field.  The other is an extension field that\n   unambiguously declares itself
    to be the last extension field in an\n   NTP packet (so any additional data MUST
    be a legacy MAC).\n\n   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE
    PUBLISHING:\n\n   The source code and issues list for this draft can be found
    in\n   https://github.com/hstenn/ietf-ntp-mac-last-ef\n\n\t </p>\n      "
