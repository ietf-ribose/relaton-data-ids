abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP submission protocol
    for a\n   client to indicate a future time for the message to be released for\n
    \  delivery.  This extension permits a client to use server-based\n   storage
    for a message that should be held in queue until an\n   appointed time in the
    future.  This is useful for clients which do\n   not have local storage or are
    otherwise unable to release a message\n   for delivery at an appointed time.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
