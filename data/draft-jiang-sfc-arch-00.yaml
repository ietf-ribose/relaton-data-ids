abstract:
- content: "<p>As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative
    services for service providers, service chaining provides a flexible way of service
    provisioning and facilitates their deployment. This document provides a general
    abstract architecture for service chaining. It is a flexible and scalable architecture
    which can fulfill requirements of service chaining. Some solutions based on this
    architecture are also discussed with their advantages and disadvantages. This
    architecture can be used as a guideline and also a criterion for the design of
    service chaining.</p>"
