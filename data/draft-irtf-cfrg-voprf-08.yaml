abstract:
- content: "<p>An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between
    client and server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF). The
    server provides the PRF secret key, and the client provides the PRF input. At
    the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything
    about the PRF secret key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output.
    A Partially-Oblivious PRF (POPRF) is an OPRF that allows client and server to
    provide public input to the PRF. OPRFs and POPRFs can also satisfy a notion of
    'verifiability'. In this setting, clients can verify that the server used a specific
    private key during the execution of the protocol. This document specifies a POPRF
    protocol with optional verifiability instantiated within standard prime-order
    groups, including elliptic curves.</p>"
