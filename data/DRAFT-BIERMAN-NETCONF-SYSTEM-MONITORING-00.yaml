abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration\ndatastores.
    \ However, client applications often need to examine\nsystem information to determine
    the appropriate configuration\nrequirements.  In addition, common system events
    such as a change in\nsystem capabilities may impact management applications.  Standard\nmechanisms
    are needed to support the monitoring of the managed system\nsupported by a NETCONF
    server.  This document defines a YANG module\nfor the monitoring of system information,
    which allows a NETCONF\nclient to identify system properties and receive notifications
    for\nsystem events.\n\t </p>\n      "
