abstract:
- content: "<p>Zero-Configuration(Zeroconf) Networking is becoming highly popular
    with the proliferation of cheap network attached devices and computers. Zeroconf
    networks are a particular class of TCP/IP networks that may be established in
    the home, in small offices or for ad-hoc purposes. Zeroconf networks do not have
    and should not be expected to have user configurable network infrastructure such
    as DHCP, DNS and other administered services [4].</p>"
