abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery
    Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery\n
    \  Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer\n   serves
    as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document supplements to\n   the CDNI Metadata
    Footprint Types defined in RFC 8006.  The Footprint\n   Types defined in this
    document can be used for Footprint objects as\n   part of the Footprint &amp;
    Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI)\n   defined in RFC 8008.  The defined
    Footprint Types are derived from\n   requirements raised by Open Caching but are
    also applicable to CDNI\n   use cases in general.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
