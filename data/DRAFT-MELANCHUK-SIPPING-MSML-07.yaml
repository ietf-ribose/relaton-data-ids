abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Media Sessions Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and\n
    \  invoke many different types of services on IP media servers.  Clients\n   can
    use it define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server\n   and to apply
    services to individual or groups of users.  MSML can be\n   used, for example,
    to control media server conferencing features such\n   as video layout and audio
    mixing, create sidebar conferences or\n   personal mixes, and set the properties
    of media streams.  As well,\n   clients can use MSML with other languages such
    as the Media Objects\n   Markup Language (MOML) or VoiceXML to interact with individual
    users\n   or with groups of conference participants.\n\t </p>\n      "
