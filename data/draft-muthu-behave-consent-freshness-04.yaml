abstract:
- content: "<p>Verification of peer consent before sending traffic is necessary in
    WebRTC deployments to ensure that a malicious JavaScript cannot use the browser
    as a platform for launching attacks. A related problem is session liveness. WebRTC
    application may want to detect connection failure and take appropriate action.
    This document describes how a WebRTC browser can verify peer consent to continue
    sending traffic and detect connection failure.</p>"
