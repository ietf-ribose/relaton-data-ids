abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Client software often desires resources or identity claims
    that are\n   independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/or\n
    \  resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release of\n   identity
    claims to a server.  Client software can then request access\n   to resources
    and/or identity claims by calling the server.  The\n   server acquires consent
    and authorization from the user and/or\n   resource owner if required, and then
    returns to the client software\n   the authorization and identity claims that
    were approved.  This\n   protocol may be extended to support alternative authorizations,\n
    \  claims, interactions, and client authentication mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
