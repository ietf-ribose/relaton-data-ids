abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The number and types of devices that are Internet connected
    continues\n   to grow.  Sensors, appliances, utility meters, medical devices etc.\n
    \  are Internet connected for various reasons.  Many of these newer\n   devices
    are constrained in terms of processing power, memory,\n   communication capability
    and, available power.  Devices such as\n   sensors and similar very small devices
    often lack a proper user\n   interface and hence configuring even the most basic
    parameters for\n   enabling Internet connectivity on these is extremely difficult.
    \ Some\n   of the existing configuration protocols can help in autoconfiguring\n
    \  various parameters of the IP stack needed for Internet connectivity.\n   However
    this is not sufficient if the devices are using a web service\n   application.
    \ There is a need for additional information such as\n   service provider name
    and username/password etc. for authentication\n   etc.  A configuration protocol
    solution for resource constrained\n   devices is needed in order to enable the
    potential enabled by\n   Internet connectivity.  This document outlines the use
    cases and\n   requirements for user friendly configuration of such information
    on a\n   constrained device, and specifies a Constrained Application Protocol\n
    \  (CoAP) based mechanism to meet the requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
