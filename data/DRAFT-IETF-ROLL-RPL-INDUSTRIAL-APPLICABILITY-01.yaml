abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed\n
    \  cost (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the\n   productivity
    and safety of industrial plants.  It will simultaneously\n   increase the efficiency
    and safety of the plant's workers, by\n   extending and making more timely the
    information set available about\n   plant operations.  The new Routing Protocol
    for Low Power and Lossy\n   Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol
    that is designed\n   for such networks.  The aim of this document is to analyze
    the\n   applicability of that routing protocol in industrial LLNs formed of\n
    \  field devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
