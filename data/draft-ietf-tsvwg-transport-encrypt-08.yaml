abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some implications of applying end-to-end encryption
    at the transport layer. It first identifies in-network uses of transport layer
    header information. Then, it reviews some implications of developing end-to-end
    transport protocols that use encryption to provide confidentiality of the transport
    protocol headers, or that use authentication to protect the integrity of transport
    header information. Since measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics
    on transport protocols has been important to the design of current transports,
    it also considers the impact of transport encryption on transport and application
    evolution.</p>"
