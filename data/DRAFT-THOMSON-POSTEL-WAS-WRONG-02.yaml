abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Jon Postel's famous statement in RFC 1122 of \"Be liberal in
    what you\n   accept, and conservative in what you send\" is a principle that has\n
    \  long guided the design and implementation of Internet protocols.  The\n   posture
    this statement advocates promotes interoperability, but can\n   produce negative
    effects in the protocol ecosystem in the long term.\n   Those effects can be avoided
    by properly maintaining protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
