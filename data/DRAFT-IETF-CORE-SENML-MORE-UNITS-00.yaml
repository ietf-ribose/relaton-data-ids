abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the\n
    \  indication of units for a quantity represented.  This short document\n   registers
    a number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for\n   Units in SenML.
    \ It also defines a registry for secondary units that\n   cannot be in SenML's
    main registry as they are derived by linear\n   transformation from units already
    in that registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
