abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Designers of information models for challenged devices connected
    to\n   the Internet, and most especially for devices that will be carried by\n
    \  people or that will be operating in people's homes, need to not\n   forget
    that people own the devices and the data, and expect those to\n   work for them,
    not against them.  This draft discusses some security\n   and privacy issues that
    may be relevant for the IAB's IOTSI workshop\n   on information models for such
    devices and related services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
