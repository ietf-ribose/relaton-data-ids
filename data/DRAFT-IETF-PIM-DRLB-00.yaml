abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM
    routers\n   is elected as a Designated Routers (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles
    in\n   the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is\n   responsible
    for registering an active source to the RP if the group\n   is operated in PIM
    SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is\n   responsible for tracking local
    multicast listeners and forwarding\n   traffic to these listeners if the group
    is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.\n   In this document, we propose a modification
    to the PIM protocol that\n   allows multiple of these last hop routers to be selected
    so that the\n   forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these\n
    \  routers.  A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group\n   is
    called a Group Designated Router (GDR).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
