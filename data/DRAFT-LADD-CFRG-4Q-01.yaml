abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Curve4Q, a twisted Edwards curve proposed
    in\n   [Curve4Q] that takes advantage of arithmetic over the field\n   GF(2^127-1)
    and two endomorphisms to achieve the speediest Diffie-\n   Hellman key agreements
    over a group of order approximately 2^246,\n   which provides around 128 bits
    of security.  Curve4Q implementations\n   are more than two times faster than
    those of Curve25519 and, when not\n   using endomorphisms, are between 1.2 and
    1.6 times faster.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
