abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a widely used system
    that\n   assigns unique identifiers to digital documents that can be queried\n
    \  and managed in a consistent fashion.  We propose a method to assign\n   DOIs
    to past and future RFCs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
