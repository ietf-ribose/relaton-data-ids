abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating\n
    \  documented examples to deployed systems, the IPv6 unicast address\n   prefix
    2001:db8::/32 is reserved for use in examples in documentation\n   including RFCs,
    books, articles, vendor manuals, etc.  This document\n   proposes the reservation
    of additional IPv6 prefixes for this\n   purpose; specifically, 3ffe::/16 (formerly
    6bone) and fec0::/10\n   (formerly site-local).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
