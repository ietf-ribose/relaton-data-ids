abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL can be implemented in data center, which is request high reliability
    and stable, but if RBridge breaks down, the switch time is up to IS-IS topology
    convergence time. This is not satisfied to the data center service. VRRP provides
    a redundancy mechanism to avoid single point of failure and fast switching over.
    This draft proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data center.</p>"
