abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Mobile IPv6 deployment scenarios for Broadband
    Wireless Access (BWA) network such as IEEE 802.16 standard. It lists questions
    that Internet Service Provider (ISP) should consider when they deploy Mobile IPv6.
    The deployment scenarios are discussed in terms of integration with Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 and Network Mobility support. The scenarios and considerations described
    in this document will be the basis for further analysis to archieve optimization
    of Mobile IPv6 deployment.</p>"
