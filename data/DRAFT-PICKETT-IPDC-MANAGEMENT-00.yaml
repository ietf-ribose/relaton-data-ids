abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The protocol described in this document is a member of the
    IP  Device\n   Control  (IPDC) family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols are proposed\n
    \  as a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually  or\n   together
    \ to perform connection control, media control, and signaling\n   transport  for
    \ environments  where  the  service  control  logic  is\n   separated  from  the
    network access server. Please see the references\n   section for other IPDC documents.\n
    \n   The protocol specification presented here is intended for use between\n   a
    \ media  gateway  controller and a media gateway.  The media gateway\n   may be
    capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice  over  ATM\n   gateway,  dialup
    \ modem  media  gateway,  circuit  switch,  or cross-\n   connect.  Using the
    IP Device Management protocol presented here, the\n   media  gateway  controller
    can obtain status and receive notification\n   of  management  events  from  the
    \ Media  Gateway  or  between  Media\n   Gateways.\n\t </p>\n      "
