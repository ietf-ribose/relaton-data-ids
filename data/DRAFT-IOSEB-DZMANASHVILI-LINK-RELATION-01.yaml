abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources
    on the\n   Web. This specification defines a link relation type which may be\n
    \  used to express the relationships between a collection and an input\n   form
    for adding additional member items to the context collection, or\n   between an
    item and a pre-populated input form for modifying the\n   context item.\n\nEditorial
    Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   Distribution of this document is unlimited.
    \ Comments should be sent\n   to the IETF Apps-Discuss mailing list (see\n   &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss&gt;).\n\n\t
