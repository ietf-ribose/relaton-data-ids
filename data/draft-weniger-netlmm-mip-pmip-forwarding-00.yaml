abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In PMIP6-MIP6 interactions scenario C, the HA and LMA are co-locatedand
    a transition between MIP6 and PMIP6 is supported without breakingthe session.
    This draft discusses possible data forwardingbehaviours of the co-located HA/LMA
    in such scenario. The tworecently discussed options are: 1) data forwarding always
    accordingto the mobile node's MIP6 BCE, if exists, which means that MIP6 BCEhas
    higher priority than PMIP6 BCE, or 2) data forwarding accordingto type of the
    last received mobility management registrationmessage, i.e., PMIP6 and MIP6 BCE
    have equal priority. It is arguedthat option 1) increases handover delay by 1
    MN-HA RTT andimplementation complexity of the HA/LMA may be higher. Hence, it
    isproposed that HA/LMA should behave according to option 2, i.e., MIP6BCE and
    PMIP6 BCE have same priority and HA/LMA forwards dataaccording to the type of
    the last received mobility managementregistration message.</p>"
