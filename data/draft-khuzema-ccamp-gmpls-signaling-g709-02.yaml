abstract:
- content: "<p>As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased
    need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced GMPLS signaling
    extensions for supporting early version of G.709 [G.709-v1].The basic routing
    considerations from signaling perspective is also specified in [RFC4328]. The
    recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43] have introduced
    new ODU containers (both fixed and flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities,
    enabling support for optimal service aggregation. This document extends [RFC4328]
    to provide GMPLS signaling support for the new OTN capabilities defined in [G.709-v3]
    and [GSUP.43]. The signaling extensions described in this document caters to ODU
    layer switching only. Optical Channel Layer switching considerations in [RFC4328]
    are not modified in this document.</p>"
