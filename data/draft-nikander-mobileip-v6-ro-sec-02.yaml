abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a succint account of the rationale behind the Mobile
    IPv6 (MIPv6) Route Optimization Security Design. The purpose of this document
    is to present the thinking and to preserve the reasoning behind the Mobile IPv6
    Security Design in 2001-2002. The document has two target audiences: (1) MIPv6
    implementors (so that they can better understand the design choices in MIPv6 security
    procedures); and (2) people dealing with mobility or multi-homing (so that they
    can avoid a number of potential security pitfalls in their design).</p>"
