abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
    LSPs in the context of a PCE. This grouping can then be used to define associations
    between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
    configuration parameters or behaviors), and is equally applicable to the active
    and passive modes of a stateful PCE as well as a stateless PCE.</p>"
