abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft brings blockchain into the detnet use case list.\n
    \  Generally speaking, blockchain is both a technical term and a\n   blockchain-based
    industry, which is spreading into a wide range of\n   industries other than the
    thriving bitcoin.  Blockchain would have to\n   require the supporting network
    offer deterministic networking service\n   rather than the ongoing best-effort,
    because of its inherent p2p and\n   frequent multicast working mechanism.\n\n
    \  Blockchain working process, its current network mechanism and\n   challenges
    ahead, as well as requirements to detnet will be\n   illustrated in the draft.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
