abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile
    IP\n   principles where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)\n
    \  binding up-to-date.  Data traffic is then encapsulated between the\n   mobility
    anchor and the MN or its Access Router.  These approaches\n   are usually implemented
    on a centralised architectures where both MN\n   context and traffic encapsulation
    need to be processed at a central\n   network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.
    \ However, one of the trend\n   in mobile network evolution is to \"flatten\"
    mobility architecture by\n   confining mobility support in the access network,
    e.g. at the access\n   routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware
    of the\n   mobility events and their support.  This document discusses the\n   deployment
    of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.\n   The solution allows
    to dynamically distribute mobility functions\n   among access routers.  The goal
    is also to dynamically adapt the\n   mobility support of the MN's needs by applying
    traffic redirection\n   only to MNs' flows when an IP handover occurs.\n\n\t </p>\n
