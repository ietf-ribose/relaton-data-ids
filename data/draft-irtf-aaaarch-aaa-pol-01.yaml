abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines some terms related to the Generic AAA architecture.
    The first section describes some broad aspects of such an architecture. The second
    section looks at the various aspects and types of policy that come into play in
    an AAA architecture. The third section will describe some of the components of
    a single policy. This work is preliminary and is expected to be complimented by
    other work from the AAAARCH research group such as [POLICY MODEL] and [POLICY
    ACCOUNTING].</p>"
