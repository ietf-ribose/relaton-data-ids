abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema
    for\n   Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State\n
    \  Transfer (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that\n   has
    been developed and deployed by ICANN in a \"RESTful\" based system\n   for the
    the last two years (at the time of writing) and is being used\n   by the registries
    responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations\n   underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and
    IP6.ARPA through an X.509 certificate\n   mediated HTTPS transaction.\n\n\t </p>\n
