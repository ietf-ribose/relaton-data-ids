abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental protocol for publicly logging
    the existence of TLS certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner
    that allows anyone to audit certificate authority activity and notice the issuance
    of suspect certificates, as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves.
    The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates which
    do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates
    to the logs. Logs are network services which implement the protocol operations
    for submissions and queries that are defined in this document.</p>"
