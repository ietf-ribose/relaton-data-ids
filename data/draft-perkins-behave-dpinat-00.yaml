abstract:
  content: "<p>SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for enabling globalInternet
    access to IPv6-only domains. New methods have been devisedfor accurate delivery
    of packets from the global Internet into theinternal domain of destinations that
    do not share a common addressspace with the majority of the global Internet. These
    improvementscan be used to augment Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy can
    beachieved in many common cases of interest.</p>"
