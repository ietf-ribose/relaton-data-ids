abstract:
  content: "\t <t>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer signalingprotocol
    that can be used to maintain an overlay network, and tostore data in and retrieve
    data from the overlay. This documentdefines a new topology plug-in for RELOAD
    that is more appropriatefor real world large scale overlays. This topology plug-inimplements
    three important functionalities that allow RELOAD tooperate under real world constraints.
    First, it includes a loadbalancing algorithm that specifies efficient allocation
    of load todifferent nodes in the network. Second, the document describesrobust
    techniques for stabilization of fingers and successors andspecifies self tuning
    mechanisms that allow dynamic and automaticadjustment of parameters needed for
    these advanced techniques in thetopology plug-in. Finally, it specifies a locality
    aware fingerselection algorithm that reduces average lookup latency.</p>"
