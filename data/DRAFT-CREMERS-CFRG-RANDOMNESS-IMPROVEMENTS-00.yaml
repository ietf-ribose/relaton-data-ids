abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related security\n
    \  protocols.  Weak or predictable \"cryptographically-strong\"\n   pseudorandom
    number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited\n   for malicious purposes.
    \ The Dual EC random number backdoor and\n   Debian bugs are relevant examples
    of this problem.  This document\n   describes a way for security protocol participants
    to mix their long-\n   term private key into the entropy pool(s) from which random
    values\n   are derived.  This augments and improves randomness from broken or\n
    \  otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
