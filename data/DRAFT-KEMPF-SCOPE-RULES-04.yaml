abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 2608, RFC 2610, and RFC 2614 provide rules for configuring
    SLP\nagents with scopes and DAs from the protocol, DHCP, and API view-\npoints,
    respectively. The rules presented in these three documents,\nwhile not in conflict,
    are ambiguous in certain cases. There are\nalso cases that fall into the cracks
    between the three documents.\nFor example, if the mandatory byte is off in DHCP
    for scopes and\nthere are no statically configured scopes, but there are DHCP\nscopes,
    should an agent use the DHCP scopes or not? This document\nspecifies a sequence
    of steps that interoperable implementations of\nSLP must follow in order to obtain
    a clear and unambiguous scope and\nDA configuration.\n\t </p>\n      "
