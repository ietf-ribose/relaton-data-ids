abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new reliable
    \ntransport protocol that provides the multihoming feature. Without \nsupport
    of routers in the networks, the SCTP with the ADDIP \nextension (called mobile
    SCTP) can be used to provide seamless \nhandover for the mobile host that is changing
    its IP subnetworks \nduring the session. In the present form, the use of mobile
    SCTP is \ntargeted for handover of the mobile sessions that are originated \nfrom
    the mobile clients (located in mobile networks) toward the \nfixed servers (located
    in the fixed networks). The support for the \nopposite directional session (initiated
    by fixed node to mobile \nnode) requires an additional location management scheme
    such as \nMobile IP. In this document, we discuss the generic procedures for \nseamless
    handover of mobile SCTP and the concerned implementation \nissues.  \n\t </p>\n
