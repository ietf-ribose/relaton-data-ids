abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To achieve seamless layer 3 handover, mobile nodes must be able
    to \nperform movement detection and neighborhood candidate access routers \ndiscovery
    quickly and efficiently.  \nIn this document, we present a conceptual overview
    on how to extend \nthe IEEE 802.11 Management frames to carry extensible application-\nspecific
    Information Element, which allow access points to advertise \nthe capabilities
    information of its associated network/provider and \nto improve movement detection.
    We believe that mobile nodes can thus \ndynamically discover neighboring candidate
    access routers or \nnetworks more quickly and efficiently, and also to obtain
    valuable \ncapabilities information so as to select the 'best' target access \nrouter
    to initiate seamless handover.  \n\t </p>\n      "
