abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered
    when\n   creating an Internet protocol.  This draft suggests that similar\n   considerations
    may apply for other human rights such as freedom of\n   expression or freedom
    of association.  A proposal is made for work in\n   the IRTF researching the possible
    connections between human rights\n   and Internet standards and protocols.  The
    goal is to create an\n   informational RFC concerning human rights protocol considerations.\n\n
