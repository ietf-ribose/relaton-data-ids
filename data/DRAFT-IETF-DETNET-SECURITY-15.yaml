abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n
    \  guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and
    bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e.\n   \"jitter\").  As
    a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition\n   to the best practice
    security measures taken for any mission-critical\n   network, additional security
    measures may be needed to secure the\n   intended operation of these novel service
    properties.\n\n   This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations
    from\n   the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and\n   component
    designer.  System considerations include a taxonomy of\n   relevant threats and
    attacks, and associations of threats versus use\n   cases and service properties.
    \ Component-level considerations include\n   ingress filtering and packet arrival
    time violation detection.\n\n   This document also addresses security considerations
    specific to the\n   IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing
    the\n   Security Considerations sections of those documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
