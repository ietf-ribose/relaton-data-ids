abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide IPsec-based flow protection
    (integrity and confidentiality) by means of an Interface to Network Security Function
    (I2NSF) Controller. It considers two main well-known scenarios in IPsec: gateway-to-gateway
    and host-to-host. The service described in this document allows the configuration
    and monitoring of IPsec Security Associations (IPsec SAs) from an I2NSF Controller
    to one or several flow-based Network Security Functions (NSFs) that rely on IPsec
    to protect data traffic. This document focuses on the I2NSF NSF-Facing Interface
    by providing YANG data models for configuring the IPsec databases, namely Security
    Policy Database (SPD), Security Association Database (SAD), Peer Authorization
    Database (PAD), and Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2). This allows IPsec
    SA establishment with minimal intervention by the network administrator. This
    document defines three YANG modules, but it does not define any new protocol.</p>"
