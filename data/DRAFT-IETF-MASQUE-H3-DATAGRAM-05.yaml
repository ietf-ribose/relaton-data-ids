abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols
    running\n   over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging\n
    \  the security and congestion-control properties of QUIC.  However,\n   QUIC
    DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex\n   application contexts.
    \ This document describes how to use QUIC\n   DATAGRAM frames when the application
    protocol running over QUIC is\n   HTTP/3.  It associates datagrams with client-initiated
    bidirectional\n   streams and defines an optional additional demultiplexing layer.\n
    \  Additionally, this document defines how to convey datagrams over\n   prior
    versions of HTTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
