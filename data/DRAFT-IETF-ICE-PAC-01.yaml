abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the process of creating a peer-to-peer connection, ICE
    agents\n   can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to check,\n
    \  and, as a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed.  However,\n   because
    additional candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE\n   processing, declaring
    failure at this point may be premature.  This\n   document discusses when these
    situations can occur and proposes a way\n   to avoid premature failure.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
