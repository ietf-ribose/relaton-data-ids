abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new protocol called WebSocket2 ontop
    of\n   HTTP/2.  The WebSocket2 protocol enables two-way binary communication\n
    \  between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment\n   to
    a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.\n\n   This protocol
    has little incommon with the WebSocket protocol\n   [RFC6455] other than client
    side API compatibility.\n\n   Please send feedback to the ietf-http-wg@w3.org
    mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
