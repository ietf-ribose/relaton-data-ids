abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a protocol extension to RPL that enables to
    install a limited amount of centrally-computed routes in a RPL graph, enabling
    loose source routing down a non-storing mode DODAG, or transversal routes inside
    the DODAG. As opposed to the classical route injection by DAO messages, this draft
    projects the routes from the root of the DODAG.</p>"
