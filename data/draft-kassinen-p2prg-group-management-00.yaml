abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a mechanism for managing peer groups in structured
    peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks. Group management enables efficient and secure
    interaction between the group members (peers), by controlling the scope of propagation
    for the group- specific P2P messaging and other communications. The mechanism
    for group management, introduced in this document, is based on a multiple-overlay
    scheme. Each group is a separate overlay network with its own address space, resources,
    and message routing information. A common overlay is used for sharing information
    about the group overlays (sub-overlays).</p>"
