abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cleartext JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of signing JSON
    objects\n   directly without representing the JSON to be signed in a non-JSON\n
    \  representation, such as base64url-encoded JSON.  The signature and\n   information
    about the signature is added to the JSON object when it\n   is signed.  The signature
    calculation for signing the JSON object\n   uses the JSON canonicalization defined
    by\n   [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme].  Cleartext JWS builds on\n
    \  the JWS, JWA, and JWK specifications, reusing data structures and\n   semantics
    from these specifications, where applicable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
