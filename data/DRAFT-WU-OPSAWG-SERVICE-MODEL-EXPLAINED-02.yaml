abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has produced a considerable number of data models
    in the\n   YANG modelling language.  The majority of these are used to model\n
    \  devices and they allow access for configuration and to read\n   operational
    status.\n\n   A small number of YANG models are used to model services (for\n
    \  example, the Layer Three Virtual Private Network Service Model\n   produced
    by the L3SM working group).\n\n   This document briefly sets out the scope of
    and purpose of an IETF\n   service model, and it shows where a service model might
    fit into a\n   Software Defined Networking architecture or deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n
