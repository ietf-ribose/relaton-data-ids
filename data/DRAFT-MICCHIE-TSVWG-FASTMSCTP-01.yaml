abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)[RFC4960] can support\n
    \  mobility by utilizing the multi-home feature and the Dynamic Address\n   Reconfiguration
    extension (ADDIP)[RFC5061].  By leveraging this\n   feature, applications that
    use SCTP can continue communication\n   without terminating it when the mobile
    node migrates to another\n   network.  However, the migration of a mobile node
    often involves\n   connectivity disruption due to bad wireless coverage, potential\n
    \  device overhead on the wireless interface to switch the wireless\n   network
    to connect, and configuring a new IP address.  The\n   connectivity disruption
    can induce significant delay on the SCTP\n   communications, because it causes
    retransmission time outs (RTOs) for\n   lost packets that are transmitted in this
    period.  In order to avoid\n   the delay caused by the RTOs, this document describes
    a new\n   retransmission trigger based on endpoint readdressing events.  SCTP\n
    \  can minimize the delay caused by migration involving connectivity\n   disruption
    with this retransmission trigger.\n\t </p>\n      "
