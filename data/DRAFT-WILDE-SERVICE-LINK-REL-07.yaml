abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources
    that\n   are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service\n
    \  provider.  Often, these sets of resources are referred to as \"Web\n   Services\"
    or \"Web APIs\".  This specification defines link relations\n   for representing
    relationships from those resources to ones that\n   provide documentation, descriptions,
    or metadata for these Web\n   services.  Documentation is primarily intended for
    human consumers,\n   whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated
    consumers;\n   metadata is supposed to be information about a service's context.
    \ It\n   also defines a link relation to identify status resources that are\n
    \  used to represent operational information about service status.\n\n\t </p>\n
