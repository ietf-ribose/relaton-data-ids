abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Smart metering deployments in residential settings introduce the
    \nprospects of ad-hoc deployment of internetworked IPv6 customer \npremise equipment
    (CPE).  WiFi access points, cable boxes and other \nhome devices with internet
    access could all be internetworked with \nsmart metering devices by customers
    with no data networking expertise \nresulting in a complex multi-segment network
    with differing\nprefixes, routing support and service discovery needs.\n\t </p>\n
