abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies a new HTTP method CONNECT-IP to proxy
    IP\n   traffic.  CONNECT-IP uses HTTP/3 Datagrams to use QUIC Datagrams for\n
    \  efficient transport of proxied IP packets, with the possibility to\n   fallback
    to HTTP/3 over reliable QUIC streams, or even HTTP 1.x and\n   2.\n\n   CONNECT-IP
    supports two modes: a tunneling mode where IP packets are\n   forwarded without
    modifications and flow forwarding mode which\n   supports optimization for individual
    IP flows forwarded to the\n   targeted peer.  To request tunneling or flow forwarding,
    a client\n   connects to a proxy server by initiating a HTTP/3 connection and\n
    \  sends a CONNECT-IP request which either indicates the address of the\n   proxy
    or the target peer.  The proxy then forwards payload received\n   on that stream
    or in an HTTP datagram with a certain stream ID.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
