abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the\n
    \  dissemination of traffic flow specification rules.  The primary\n   application
    of this extension is DDoS mitigation where the flowspec\n   rules are applied
    in most cases to all peering routers of the\n   network.\n\n   This document will
    present another use case of BGP Flow-spec where\n   flow specifications are used
    to maintain some access control lists at\n   network boundary.  BGP Flowspec is
    a very efficient distributing\n   machinery that can help in saving OPEX while
    deploying/updating ACLs.\n   This new application requires flow specification
    rules to be applied\n   only on a specific subset of interfaces and in a specific
    direction.\n\n   The current specification of BGP Flow-spec ([RFC5575]) introduces
    the\n   notion of flow specification (which describes the matching criterion)\n
    \  and traffic filtering actions.  The flow specification is encoded as\n   part
    of the NLRI while the traffic filtering actions are encoded as\n   extended communities.
    \ The combination of a flow specification and\n   one or more actions is known
    as a flow specification rule.  [RFC5575]\n   does not detail where the flow specification
    rules need to be\n   applied.\n\n   Besides the flow specification and traffic
    filtering actions, this\n   document introduces the notion of traffic filtering
    scope in order to\n   drive where a particular rule must be applied.  In particular,
    this\n   document introduces the \"interface-set\" traffic filtering scope that\n
    \  could be used in parallel of traffic filtering actions (marking,\n   rate-limiting
    ...).  The purpose of this extension is to inform\n   remote routers about groups
    of interfaces where the rule must be\n   applied.\n\n   This extension can also
    be used in a DDoS mitigation context where a\n   provider wants to apply the filtering
    only on specific peers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
