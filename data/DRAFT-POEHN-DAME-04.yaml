abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the integration of Dynamic Automated
    Metadata\n   Exchange (DAME) through an intermediate trusted third party into
    the\n   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Web Browser SSO\n   Profile.
    \ The user-triggered, on-demand, and fully automated metadata\n   exchange between
    identity provider (IDP) and service provider (SP) is\n   intended for scenarios
    in which the a-priori, e.g., federation-based\n   exchange of SAML metadata is
    neither practical, scalable nor\n   mandatory for non-technical aspects, such
    as contract-based trust\n   building between IDP and SP.  The main benefit of
    DAME is the removal\n   of waiting times for users and manual setup tasks for
    IDP and SP\n   administrators before users can access the service.  Implementations\n
    \  of DAME can leverage existing metadata repositories, such as REEP,\n   and
    metadata transfer protocols, such as MD Query.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
