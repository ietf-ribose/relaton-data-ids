abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle
    low\npower and lossy networks.  Automobiles are already equipped with\nseveral
    sensors and devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for\ncontrolling, monitoring
    and entertainment, etc.  For the future in-\nvehicle networks, the shift to wireless
    is desirable due to heavy\nweight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able
    to efficiently\ninstall devices.  However, with the limitation of low power, in-\nvehicle
    network still requires reliability and scalability in nature\nof the rolls of
    ECU.  The routing protocol should support the\nfeatures of low-power, high-reliability,
    Subnetting, QoS, Mobility,\netc.  This document briefly explains the in-vehicle
    networks and\nECUs, then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in-\nvehicle
    networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
