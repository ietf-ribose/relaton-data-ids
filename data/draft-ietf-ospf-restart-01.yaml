abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IPnetworks.
    Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via Hellosubprotocol. Hello
    OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-wayconnectivity within time. When a router
    restarts its OSPF software,it may not know its neighbors. If such a router sends
    a hello packeton an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency,which
    may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo providesa mechanism that
    allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors aboutthe restart process. Note that
    this mechanism requires support fromneighboring routers.</p>"
