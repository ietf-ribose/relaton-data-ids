abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A BGP route defines an association of an address prefix with
    an \"exit\n   point\" from the current Autonomous System (AS).  If the exit point\n
    \  becomes unreachable due to a failure, the route becomes invalid.\n   This usually
    triggers an exchange of BGP control messages after which\n   a new BGP route for
    the given prefix is installed.  However,\n   connectivity can be restored more
    quickly if the router maintains\n   precomputed BGP backup routes.  It can then
    switch to a backup route\n   immediately upon learning that an exit point is unreachable,
    without\n   needing to wait for the BGP control messages exchange.  This document\n
    \  specifies the procedures to be used by BGP to maintain and distribute\n   the
    precomputed backup routes.  Maintaining these additional routes\n   is also useful
    in promoting load balancing, performing maintenance\n   without causing traffic
    loss, and in reducing churn in the BGP\n   control plane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
