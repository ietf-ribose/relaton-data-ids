abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the use of ROHC header compression mechanisms
    \nfor the NEMO Basic Support protocol [7]. The idea is to use both NEMO \nand
    ROHC as they have been defined. In the NEMO Basic Support \nprotocol, the tunneling
    between the Mobile Router (MR) and the Home \nAgent (HA) of the MR is done over
    different access technologies. Some \nof these technologies are wireless (e.g.
    Wireless LAN, 3G or PPP) and \nhave scarce resources by nature, the use of  ROHC
    compression can be \nuseful to reduce the bandwidth consumption.\n\t </p>\n      "
