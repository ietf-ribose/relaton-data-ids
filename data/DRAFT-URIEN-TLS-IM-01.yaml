abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS 1.3 will be deployed in the Internet of Things ecosystem.
    In\n   many IoT frameworks, TLS or DTLS protocols, based on pre-shared key\n   (PSK),
    are used for device authentication. So PSK tamper resistance,\n   is a critical
    market request, in order to prevent hijacking issues.\n   If DH exchange is used
    with certificate bound to DH ephemeral public\n   key, there is also a benefit
    to protect its signature procedure. The\n   TLS identity module (im) MAY be based
    on secure element; it realizes\n   some HKDF operations bound to PSK, and cryptographic
    signature if\n   certificates are used. Secure Element form factor could be\n
    \  standalone chip, or embedded in SOC like eSIM.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
