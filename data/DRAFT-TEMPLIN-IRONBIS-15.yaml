abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet
    must\n   continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is\n
    \  clear that Autonomous Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive\n   de-aggregated
    prefixes into the interdomain routing system and\n   instead mitigate de-aggregation
    internally.  This document describes\n   an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
    architecture that supports\n   sustainable growth within AS-interior routing domains
    while requiring\n   no changes to end systems and no changes to the exterior routing\n
    \  system.  In addition to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other\n   important
    issues including mobility management, mobile networks,\n   multihoming, traffic
    engineering, NAT traversal and security.  While\n   business considerations are
    an important determining factor for\n   widespread adoption, they are out of scope
    for this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
