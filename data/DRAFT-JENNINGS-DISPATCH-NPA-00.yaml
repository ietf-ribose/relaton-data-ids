abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a modification to\ndraft-lawrence-dispatch-sipforum-provider-alias
    (PAN).  The PAN draft\nproposes a mechanism for a phone to take a short numeric
    identifier\nthat identifies a phone service provider and look it up in DNS to\nfind
    the address of the configuration server for that service\nprovider.\n\nThe problem
    with PAN is that it requires a specific organization,\nsipforum.org, to become
    a registrar for the PAN.  This will add\nsignifiant cost to obtaining them as
    the expected quantity of PAN is\nlow.  This draft proposes a minor modification
    to the PAN draft.\nInstead of using the sipforum as a new registrar, why not just
    use\nthe registrars that already exist for DNS names.  This ensure a long\nterm
    stable unique allocation of PAN with the advantages of not\nhaving the IETF allocating
    a monopoly to one particular organization.\n\t </p>\n      "
