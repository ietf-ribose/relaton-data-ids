abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the usage of Information Centric Networks\n
    \  (ICN) for adaptive multimedia streaming and identifies problems,\n   which
    have to be considered for such applications. Several important\n   topics related
    to video distribution over ICN are presented,\n   covering a range of scenarios:
    DASH over ICN, which leverages the\n   recent ISO/IEC MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
    over HTTP (DASH)\n   standard, layered encoding over ICN, PPSP over ICN and IPTV
    over\n   ICN. DASH over ICN offers the possibility to transfer data from\n   multiple
    sources as well as over multiple links in parallel, which\n   is definitely an
    important feature, e.g., for mobile devices\n   offering multiple network links.
    In addition to this, the named\n   multimedia content is routed and cached efficiently
    by the\n   underlying network. PPSP extends the P2P semantics to video\n   streaming
    in ICNs. The real time constraints of IPTV and video-\n   conferencing need to
    be addressed in ICN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
