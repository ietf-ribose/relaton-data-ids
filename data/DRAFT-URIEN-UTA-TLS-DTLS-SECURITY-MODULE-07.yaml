abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Security and trust are very critical topics in the context
    of the\n   anywhere, anytime, anything internet connectivity. TLS and DTLS are\n
    \  two major IETF protocols widely used to secure IP exchanges.\n   According
    to CoAP, DTLS is the protocol used by constraint nodes in\n   the Internet of
    Things (IoT) context.\n\n   In this draft we specify an ISO7816 interface for
    TLS and DTLS\n   secure modules based on ISO7816 secure chips, which are today\n
    \  manufactured per billions every year.\n\n   Secure elements are cheap secure
    microcontrollers whose size is\n   about 25mm2 and whose security is ranked by
    evaluations typically\n   according to Common Criteria (CC) standards.\n\n   The
    support of TLS and DTLS is based on the EAP-TLS protocol, and\n   the IETF draft
    \"EAP Support in smartcard\" describing EAP-TLS support\n   for secure elements.
    First implementation demonstrates that such low\n   cost security modules are
    realistic, with a setup time for handshake\n   completion under the second.\n\n\n\n\t
