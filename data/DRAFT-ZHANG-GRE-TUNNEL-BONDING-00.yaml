abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is an emerging demand to provide redundancy and load-sharing\n
    \  across wired and cellular links from a single service provider so\n   that
    one customer is provided with \"Hybrid Access\" to the bonding of\n   multiple
    heterogeneous connections.\n\n   In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
    Tunnel Bonding\n   is specified as an enabling approach for Hybrid Access. In
    GRE Tunnel\n   Bonding, GRE tunnels per network connections are set up and bonded\n
    \  together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with\n   each
    composing connection, the bonding connection promises increased\n   access capacity
    and improved reliability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
