abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of\n\"Unwanted
    Internet Traffic\".  The report from that workshop is\ndocumented in RFC 4948
    [RFC4948].  Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for\n\"[t]ightening the security of
    the core routing infrastructure.\"  Four\nmain steps were identified for improving
    the security of the routing\ninfrastructure.  One of those steps was \"securing
    the routing\nprotocols' packets on the wire,\" also called the routing protocol\ntransport.
    \ One mechanism for securing routing protocol transports is\nthe use of per-packet
    cryptographic message authentication, providing\nboth peer authentication and
    message integrity.  Many different\nrouting protocols exist and they employ a
    range of different\ntransport subsystems.  Therefore there must necessarily be
    various\nmethods defined for applying cryptographic authentication to these\nvarying
    protocols.  Many routing protocols already have some method\nfor accomplishing
    cryptographic message authentication.  However, in\nmany cases the existing methods
    are dated, vulnerable to attack,\nand/or employ cryptographic algorithms that
    have been deprecated.\nThe \"Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols\"
    (KARP) effort\naims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms.  This document has
    two\nmain parts.  The first describes the threat analysis for attacks\nagainst
    routing protocols' transports.  The second enumerates the\nrequirements for addressing
    the described threats.  This document,\nalong with the KARP Design Guide and KARP
    Framework documents, will\nbe used by KARP design teams for specific protocol
    review and\noverhaul.  This document reflects the input of both the IETF's\nSecurity
    Area and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed upon\nguidance.\n\t </p>\n
