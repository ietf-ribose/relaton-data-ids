abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes version 2 of the Optimized Link State
    Routing\n   (OLSRv2) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an\n
    \  optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the\n   requirements
    of a mobile wireless LAN.\n\n   The key optimization of OLSRv2 is that of multipoint
    relays,\n   providing an efficient mechanism for network-wide broadcast of link-\n
    \  state information.  A secondary optimization is, that OLSRv2 employs\n   partial
    link-state information: each node maintains information of\n   all destinations,
    but only a subset of links.  This allows that only\n   select nodes diffuse link-state
    advertisements (i.e. reduces the\n   number of network-wide broadcasts) and that
    these advertisements\n   contain only a subset of links (i.e. reduces the size
    of each\n   network-wide broadcast).  The partial link-state information thus\n
    \  obtained allows each OLSRv2 node to at all times maintain optimal (in\n   terms
    of number of hops) routes to all destinations in the network.\n\n   OLSRv2 imposes
    minimum requirements to the network by not requiring\n   sequenced or reliable
    transmission of control traffic.  Furthermore,\n   the only interaction between
    OLSRv2 and the IP stack is routing table\n   management.\n\n   OLSRv2 is particularly
    suitable for large and dense networks as the\n   technique of MPRs works well
    in this context.\n\t </p>\n      "
