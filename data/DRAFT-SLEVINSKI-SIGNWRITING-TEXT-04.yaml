abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For concreteness, because the universal character set is not
    yet\n   universal, and because an international standard for the internet\n   community
    should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released\n   with the intention
    of producing an RFC to document the character use\n   and naming conventions of
    the SignWriting community on the Internet.\n\n   The SignWriting Script is an
    international standard for writing sign\n   languages by hand or with computers.
    \ From education to research,\n   from entertainment to religion, SignWriting
    has proven useful because\n   people are using it to write signed languages.  The
    SignWriting\n   Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and\n
    \  Handwriting for the writer.\n\n   Formal SignWriting uses ASCII strings to
    name logographic signs.  The\n   mathematical names are explained with tokens
    and regular expression\n   patterns.  Symbol keys reference the symbols of the
    International\n   SignWriting Alphabet 2010.  Coordinates define X and Y number
    values\n   for 2-dimensional placement.  Signs are written in a spatial SignBox,\n
    \  where each symbol is positioned with a 2-dimension coordinate.  For\n   sorting,
    each sign can have an optional temporal sequence of symbols\n   that is outside
    of the SignBox and the visible text.  Completed signs\n   are written sequentially,
    interspersed with punctuation symbols, to\n   form sentences.\n\n   The query
    language of Formal SignWriting uses a similar lite markup\n   to define a variety
    of searching possibilities.  The spatial SignBox\n   can be searched for symbols
    or ranges of symbols.  For each symbol or\n   range, the search can specify if
    the symbol only needs to be found\n   somewhere in the SignBox, or if the symbol
    needs to be found near\n   certain coordinates.  The temporal sequence can be
    searched for\n   starting symbols, written as a sequential list of symbols and
    ranges\n   of symbols.  When searching the temporal sequence, the search results\n
    \  will be limited to signs that start with a matching temporal\n   sequence.
    \ Each query string is transformed into one or more regular\n   expressions.  The
    regular expressions are used to quickly search\n   large amounts of data.\n\n
    \  For Unicode, there are several encodings which integrate.  Formal\n   SignWriting
    is UTF-8.  The Unicode 8 specification will include\n   characters to name the
    symbols of the International SignWriting\n   Alphabet 2010.  There are 2 separate
    encodings in the Unicode Private\n   Use Area.  The plane 15 encoding is isomorphic
    with Formal\n   SignWriting strings, using 3 characters for each symbol.  The
    plane\n   16 encoding is focused on the symbols only, using 1 character for\n
    \  each symbol.\n\n   Three appendices discuss additional topics to the standard.
    \ The\n   first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document,\n
    \  stable since January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the symbol\n   encoding
    of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010.  The third\n   discusses the SignPuddle
    Standards: licences, infrastructure, and\n   compatibility.\n\n   This memo concretely
    defines a conceptual character encoding map for\n   the Internet community.  It
    is published for reference, examination,\n   implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution
    of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
