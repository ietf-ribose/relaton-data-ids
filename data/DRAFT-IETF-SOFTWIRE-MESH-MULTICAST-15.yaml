abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both
    address\n   families and their related protocol suites support multicast of the\n
    \  single-source and any-source varieties.  During IPv6 transition,\n   there
    will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP\n   address family internally
    (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will\n   provide transit services to attached
    client networks running another\n   IP address family (referred to as external
    IP or E-IP).  It is\n   expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and
    multicast\n   transit services to the client E-IP networks.\n\n   Softwire Mesh
    is a solution providing E-IP unicast and multicast\n   support across an I-IP
    backbone.  This document describes the\n   mechanism for supporting Internet-style
    multicast across a set of\n   E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwire mesh.
    \ We focus on IPv4-\n   over-IPv6 scenario in this document, due to lack of real-world
    use\n   cases for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
