abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is a class of data serving protocols and applications thatcannot
    tolerate undetected data corruption on the wire. Datacorruption could occur at
    the source in software, in the networkinterface card, out on the link, on intermediate
    routers or at thedestination network interface card or node. The Ethernet CRC
    and the16-bit checksum in the TCP/UDP headers are used to detect dataerrors. Most
    applications rely on these checksums to detect datacorruptions and do not use
    any checksums or CRC checks at theirlevel. Research has shown that the TCP/UDP
    checksums are catching asignificant number of errors, however, the research suggests
    that onepacket in 10 billion will have an error that goes undetected forEthernet
    MTU frames (MTU of 1500). Under certain situations, \"bad\"hosts can introduce
    undetected errors at a much higher frequency andorder. With the use of Jumbo frames
    on the rise, and therefore moredata bits on the wire that could be corrupted,
    the current 16-bitTCP/UDP checksum, or the Ethernet 32-bit CRC are simply notsufficient
    for detecting errors. This document specifies a proposalto use stronger checksum
    algorithms for TCP Jumbo Frames for IPv4 andIPv6 networks. The Castagnoli CRC
    32C algorithm used in iSCSI andSCTP is proposed as the error detection code of
    choice.</p>"
