abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
    as defined in RFC 3986, for designating connections and destination addresses
    used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS). It was originally designed for particular
    uses, but applies generally wherever a JMS URI is needed to describe the connection
    to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS Destination. The syntax of this JMS URI
    is not compatible with previously existing, but unregistered, "jms" URI schemes.
    However, the expressiveness of the scheme described herein should satisfy the
    requirements of all existing circumstances. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
