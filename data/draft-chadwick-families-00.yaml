abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes protocol support, in the form of LDAPcontrols,
    for compound entries. A compound entry logically allowscollections of attributes
    to be grouped together as though they werepresent in the single compound entry,
    whereas in fact they are heldin a hierarchical set of entries beneath the compound
    entry. The LDAPcontrols allow the user to treat a compound entry as either separateentries
    or as a single compound entry when both searching, retrievingand deleting information
    from the DIT. Compound entries are brieflydescribed here and a full description
    of them can be found in thedraft version of X.500 (2000)[FPDAM].</p>"
