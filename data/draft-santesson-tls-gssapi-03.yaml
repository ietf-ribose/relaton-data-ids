abstract:
  content: <p>This document defines extensions to RFC 4279, "Pre-Shared KeyCiphersuites
    for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", to enable dynamickey sharing in distributed
    environments using a Generic SecurityService Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    mechanism, and thenimport that shared key as the "Pre-Shared Key" to complete
    the TLShandshake.This is a modular approach to perform authentication and key
    exchangebased on off-shelf libraries. And it obviates the need of pair-wisekey
    sharing by enabling the use of the widely-deployed Kerberos aliketrust infrastructures
    that are highly scalable and robust.Furthermore, conforming implementations can
    provide serverauthentication without the use of certificates.</p>
