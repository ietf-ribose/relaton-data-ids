abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an innovative frame, called PLIC,(\"Performance\nLayer
    Inboard Computing\") able to support active, passive or hybrid\nperformance measurements
    on any kind of unicast and multicast service\npassing through a network. It is
    based on an algorithm which, through\na distributed computation, floods the performance
    measurements of each\nnode to the rest of the network, without necessity of any
    external\ntopology database or operation support system. It has been invented\nand
    engineered in the Telecom Italia Core Network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
