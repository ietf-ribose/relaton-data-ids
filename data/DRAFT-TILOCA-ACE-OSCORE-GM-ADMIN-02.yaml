abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication for CoAP can be secured using Group Object\n
    \  Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE).  A\n   Group
    Manager is responsible to handle the joining of new group\n   members, as well
    as to manage and distribute the group key material.\n   This document defines
    a RESTful admin interface at the Group Manager,\n   that allows an Administrator
    entity to create and delete OSCORE\n   groups, as well as to retrieve and update
    their configuration.  The\n   ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization
    is used to enforce\n   authentication and authorization of the Administrator at
    the Group\n   Manager.  Protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE are used to\n
    \  achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server\n   authentication.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
