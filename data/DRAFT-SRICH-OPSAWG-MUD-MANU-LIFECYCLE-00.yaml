abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions, or MUDs, allow a manufacturer
    to\n   cheaply and simply describe to the network the accesses required\n   by
    an IoT device without adding any extra cost or software to the\n   devices themselves.
    \ By doing so, the network infrastructure\n   devices can apply access policies
    automatically which increase the\n   overall security of the entire network, not
    just for the IoT\n   devices themselves.  This document describes the lifecycle
    of\n   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs) by describing detailed MUD\n   scenarios
    from the perspective of manufacturers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
