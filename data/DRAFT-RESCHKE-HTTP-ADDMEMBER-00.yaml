abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Frequently, servers may want to allow resource creation through
    HTTP,\n   but are not able to support HTTP's PUT method for creating new\n   resources,
    as resource names are completely controlled by the server.\n   This document proposes
    a new HTTP method called 'ADDMEMBER' with\n   semantics similar to those of PUT,
    except for the fact that the\n   server chooses the URI for the newly created
    resource.\n\t </p>\n      "
