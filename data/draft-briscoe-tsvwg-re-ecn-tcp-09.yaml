abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document introduces a new protocol for explicit congestionnotification
    (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployedincrementally around unmodified routers.
    The protocol works byarranging an extended ECN field in each packet so that, as
    it crossesany interface in an internetwork, it will carry a truthful predictionof
    congestion on the remainder of its path. The purpose of thisdocument is to specify
    the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and togive guidelines on any consequent changes
    required to transportprotocols. It includes the changes required to TCP both as
    anexample and as a specification. It briefly gives examples ofmechanisms that
    can use the protocol to ensure data sources respondcorrectly to congestion, but
    these are described more fully in acompanion document.</p>"
