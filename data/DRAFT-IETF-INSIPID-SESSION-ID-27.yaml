abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an end-to-end session identifier for use
    in IP-based multimedia communication systems that enables endpoints, intermediary
    devices, and management systems to identify a session end-to-end, associate multiple
    endpoints with a given multipoint conference, track communication sessions when
    they are redirected, and associate one or more media flows with a given communication
    session. While the identifier is intended to work across multiple protocols, this
    document describes its usage in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n\n This
    document also describes a backwards-compatibility mechanism for an existing session
    identifier implementation (RFC 7329) that is sufficiently different from the procedures
    defined in this document.\n\n This document obsoletes RFC 7329.\n\t </p>\n      "
