abstract:
  content: "<p>In general, certificates need not be communicated with communication
    orstorage media that are integrity-secure or authentic. This is becausecertificates
    are digitally signed and users are expected to validate thesignatures using configured
    trust anchors. However, distribution oftrust anchor certificates, self-signed
    end-entity certificates, or bare(unsigned) public keys requires a mechanism for
    establishing theauthenticity of the certificate or public key.</p>"
