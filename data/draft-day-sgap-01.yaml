- content: "<p>The Simple General Awareness Protocol (SGAP) provides notifications
    of changes to small data items. The changes are selectively made available to
    a large collection of viewers. This facility is most useful for a class of applications
    variously called people locators, colleague-awareness tools, people browsers,
    or ''buddy lists''.</p>"
