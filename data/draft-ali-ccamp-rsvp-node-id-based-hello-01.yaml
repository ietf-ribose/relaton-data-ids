abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of node-id based RSVP Hello messages is implied in a number of
    cases, e.g., when data and control plan are separated, when TE links are unnumbered.
    Furthermore, when link level failure detection is performed by some means other
    than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based Hellos is optimal for detecting signaling
    adjacency failure for RSVP- TE. Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear
    and this document formalizes use of node-id based RSVP Hello sessions as a best
    current practice (BCP) in some scenarios.</p>"
