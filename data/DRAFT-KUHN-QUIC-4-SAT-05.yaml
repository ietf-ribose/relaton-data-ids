abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC has been designed for use across Internet paths.  Initial\n
    \  designs of QUIC focused on common deployment scenarios for web\n   traffic.
    \ This document focuses on the performance when using a path\n   with a large
    Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP).\n\n   A large BDP path can result from using a
    satellite communication\n   (SATCOM) system.  The BDP is also high for paths where
    a satellite\n   network segment is combined with other network technologies\n
    \  (Ethernet, cable modems, WiFi, cellular, radio links, etc), resulting\n   in
    more complex characteristics.  These path characteristics have\n   implications
    on the efficiency of the network traffic and unless\n   considered in a design
    can impact the end-to-end quality of\n   experience by the transport service.\n\n
    \  This memo identifies the characteristics of a SATCOM link that impact\n   the
    operation of the QUIC transport protocol.  It proposes regression\n   tests to
    evaluate QUIC over SATCOM links.  It discusses how to ensure\n   acceptable protocol
    performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
