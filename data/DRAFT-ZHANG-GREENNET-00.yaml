abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Energy consumption of network infrastructures is rising fast.
    \ There\n   are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering,\n
    \  which adjust routing paths to help reduce power consumption network-\n   wide.
    \ This document gives a high-level analysis on the basic\n   requirements, approaches,
    and potential issues in power-aware routing\n   and traffic engineering.\n\n\t
