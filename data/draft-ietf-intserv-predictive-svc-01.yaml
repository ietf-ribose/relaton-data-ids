abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the network element behavior required to deliver
    Predictive service in the Internet. Predictive service is a real-time service
    that provides low packet loss and a fairly reliable delay bound. This service
    is intended for applications that are tolerant of occasional late arriving packets,
    but require substantial and quantified levels of delay control from the network.
    Predictive service is very similar to Controlled Delay service, and the two specifications
    have a fair amount of shared language. The main salient different between the
    two services is that Predictive service offers a delay bound and Controlled Delay
    does not. If no characterizations are provided, then Predictive service is, from
    an application's perspective, almost indistinguishable from Controlled Delay;
    the delay bounds are of little use if the endpoints are not aware of them. Thus,
    the distinction between Predictive and Controlled Delay is important only in contexts
    where characterizations are made available to endpoints. This specification follows
    the service specification template described in [1].</p>"
