abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol.\n
    \  The protocol is designed for providing mobility management support to\n   a
    mobile node, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility\n   related
    signaling.  The base protocol is defined in an access\n   technology independent
    manner, it identifies the general requirements\n   from the link-layer for supporting
    the protocol operation.  However,\n   it does not provide any specific details
    on how it can be supported\n   on a specific access technology.  This specification
    identifies the\n   key considerations for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
    on the\n   widely deployed wireless LAN access architectures, based on IEEE\n
    \  802.11 standards.  It explores the current dominant wireless LAN\n   deployment
    models and provides the needed interworking details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
