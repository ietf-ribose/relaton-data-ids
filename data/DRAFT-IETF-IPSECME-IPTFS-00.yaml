abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to enhance IPsec traffic
    flow\n   security by adding traffic flow confidentiality to encrypted IP\n   encapsulated
    traffic.  Traffic flow confidentiality is provided by\n   obscuring the size and
    frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-sized,\n   constant-send-rate IPsec tunnel.
    \ The solution allows for congestion\n   control as well.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
