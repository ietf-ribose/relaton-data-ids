abstract:
- content: "<p>By default, presence delivered using the presence event package for
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is represented in the Presence Information
    Data Format (PIDF). A PIDF document contains a set of elements, each representing
    a different aspect of the presence being reported. When any subset of the elements
    change, even just a single element, a new document containing the full set of
    elements is delivered. This memo defines an extension allowing delivery of only
    the presence data that has actually changed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
