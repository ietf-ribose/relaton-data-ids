abstract:
- content: "<p>During the process of establishing peer-to-peer connectivity, ICE agents
    can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to check, and, as
    a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed. However, because additional
    candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE processing, declaring failure at
    this point may be premature. This document discusses when these situations can
    occur and updates RFC8445 and RFC XXXX by requiring that an ICE agent wait a minimum
    amount of time before declaring ICE failure, even if there are no candidate pairs
    left to check. [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
    draft-ietf-ice-trickle once it has been published. Please also indicate that this
    specification updates RFC XXXX.]</p>"
