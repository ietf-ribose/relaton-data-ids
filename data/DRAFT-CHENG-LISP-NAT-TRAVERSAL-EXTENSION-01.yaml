abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies several special NAT traversal scenarios
    when two\n   or more LISP Sites/MNs which locate behind the same NAT equipment\n
    \  communicate with each other.  When these LISP Sites/MNs communicate\n   with
    each other, it may cause routing latency and will increase re-\n   encapsulation
    load on Re-encapsulating Tunnel Routers(RTRs) based on\n   existing LISP-NAT strategy.\n\n
    \  In this draft, we give detail descriptions of these scenarios.  Also\n   we
    propose some suggestions to solve the problems.  According to our\n   strategy,
    a new kind of message is used for RTRs to send relative\n   information of Corresponding
    Sites/MNs to xTRs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
