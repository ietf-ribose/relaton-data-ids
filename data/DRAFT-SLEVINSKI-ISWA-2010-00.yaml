abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet\n
    \  universal, because an undocumented and unlabeled coded character set\n   hampers
    information interchange, a 12-bit coded character set has\n   been created that
    encodes the graphemes of the SignWriting script as\n   described in the open standard
    of the International SignWriting\n   Alphabet 2010.  The x-ISWA-2010 coded character
    set is defined with\n   hexadecimal characters and described with Unicode characters,
    either\n   proposed characters on plane 1 or interchange characters on plane 15.\n\n
    \  This memo defines a standard coded character set for the Internet\n   community.
    \ It is published for reference, examination,\n   implementation, and evaluation.
    \ Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\t </p>\n      "
