abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for routers and switches
    in\n   Spine-Leaf type topology to have non-reciprocal Intermediate System\n   to
    Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing relationships between the\n   leafs and spines.
    \ The leaf nodes do not need to have the topology\n   information of other nodes
    and exact prefixes in the network.  This\n   extension also has application in
    the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
