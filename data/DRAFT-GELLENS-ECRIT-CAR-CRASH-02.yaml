abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by
    vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually
    invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location
    data related to the crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as
    \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n   (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\"
    (AACN), even in the\n   case of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers
    to the\n   ability to carry a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers
    a MIME Content Type and an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle,
    sensor, and location data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though
    there is not\n   necessarily a crash).\n\n   Profiling and simplifications are
    possible due to the nature of the\n   functionality that is provided in vehicles
    with the usage of Global\n   Satellite Navigation System (GNSS).\n\n\t </p>\n
