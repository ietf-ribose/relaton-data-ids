abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a framework for Content Distribution
    Network\n   Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide\n
    \  an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the\n   relationships
    among the various components necessary to interconnect\n   CDNs.  CDN Interconnection
    requires the specification of interfaces\n   and mechanisms to address issues
    such as request routing,\n   distribution metadata exchange, and logging information
    exchange\n   across CDNs.  The intent of this document is to outline what each\n
    \  interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces\n   and
    mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed\n   specification to other
    documents.  It obsoletes RFC 3466.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
