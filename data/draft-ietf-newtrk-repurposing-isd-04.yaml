abstract:
  content: "\t <t>It has been observed that the current IETF standard designations,
    STDnnnn and BCP nnnn designation, have not worked well. Problems havebeen found
    when one of them is used either as a stable reference forexternal specifications
    or as a combined reference for multipledocuments linked together into a single
    document. This documentproposes two changes to these designations. The first of
    thesechanges would create a new document series and assign a new numberand acronym
    to a specification when it enters the first level of theStandards Track (or is
    first designated as a BCP). The second wouldmigrate the concept of STDs and BCPs
    numbering of RFCs into actualdocuments that detail what they identify, their publicationinformation
    and their change history. The document also specifies aset of minor standards
    process changes to accommodate and integratethe new style of doing things that
    is represented by the new documentseries.</p>"
