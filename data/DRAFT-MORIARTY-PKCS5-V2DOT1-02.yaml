abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides recommendations for the implementation
    of\n   password-based cryptography, covering key derivation functions,\n   encryption
    schemes, message-authentication schemes, and ASN.1 syntax\n   identifying the
    techniques.\n\n   The recommendations are intended for general application within\n
    \  computer and communications systems, and as such include a fair\n   amount
    of flexibility. They are particularly intended for the\n   protection of sensitive
    information such as private keys, as in PKCS\n   #8 [PKCS8][RFC5958]. It is expected
    that application standards and\n   implementation profiles based on these specifications
    may include\n   additional constraints.\n\n   Other cryptographic techniques based
    on passwords, such as password-\n   based key entity authentication and key establishment
    protocols are\n   outside the scope of this document.  Guidelines for the selection
    of\n   passwords are also outside the scope.\n\n   This document represents a
    republication of PKCS #5 v2.1 [PKCS5_21]\n   from RSA Laboratories' Public-Key
    Cryptography Standards (PKCS)\n   series. By publishing this RFC, change control
    is transferred to the\n   IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
