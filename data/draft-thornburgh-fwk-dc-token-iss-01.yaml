abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol framework for HTTP clients to obtain
    bearer tokens for accessing restricted resources, where in some applications the
    client may not have prior knowledge of, or a direct relationship with, the resource
    server's authorization infrastructure (such as in decentralized identity systems).
    Semi-concrete applications of the framework using proof-of-possession and TLS
    client certificate mechanisms are also described.</p>"
