abstract:
  content: "<p>One desirable application of BFD is to detect a MPLS LSP data planefailure.
    LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] is an existing mechanism for detectingMPLS data plane failures
    and for verifying the MPLS LSP data planeagainst the control plane. BFD can be
    used for the former, but notfor the latter. However a combination of LSP-Ping
    and BFD can be usedto provide faster data plane failure detection and/or make
    itpossible to provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs. Thisdocument
    describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Pingfor this application.
    It also describes procedures for using BFD inthis environment.</p>"
