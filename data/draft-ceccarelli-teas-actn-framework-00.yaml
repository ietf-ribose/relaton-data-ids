abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation
    of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and
    provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms
    represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking. Abstraction
    of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain
    or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under
    the control of a network operator that may be the customer of the operator that
    actually owns the network resources. This draft provides a framework for Abstraction
    and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN).</p>"
