abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms
    are\n   critical building blocks in network operations.  They used for\n   service
    fulfillment assurance, and for service diagnosis,\n   troubleshooting, and repair.
    \ The current practice is that many\n   technologies rely on their own OAM protocols
    and procedures that are\n   exclusive to a given layer.\n\n   At present, there
    is little consolidation of OAM in the management\n   plane or well-documented
    inter-layer OAM operation.  Vendors and\n   operators dedicate significant resources
    and effort through the whole\n   OAM life-cycle each time a new technology is
    introduced.  This is\n   exacerbated when dealing with integration of OAM into
    overlay\n   networks, which require better OAM visibility since there is no\n
    \  method to exchange OAM information between overlay and underlay.\n\n   This
    document analyzes the problem space for multi-layer OAM in the\n   management
    plane with a focus on layer and technology independent OAM\n   management considerations.
    \ It concludes that an attempt to define an\n   architecture for consolidated
    management should be undertaken, and if\n   this attempt satisfies key objectives,
    a gap analysis and a program\n   of standardization should follow.\n\n\t </p>\n
