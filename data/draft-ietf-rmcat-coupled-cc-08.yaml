abstract:
- content: "<p>When multiple congestion controlled Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their controls can improve
    the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of delay, loss and fairness. This document
    describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way that is
    as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the amount of changes needed
    to existing RTP applications. It specifies how to apply the method for the Network-Assisted
    Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) congestion control algorithm, and provides suggestions
    on how to apply it to other congestion control algorithms.</p>"
