abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol. It extends the ALTO cost information service so
    that applications decide not only 'where' to connect but also 'when'. This is
    useful for applications that need to perform bulk data transfer and would like
    to schedule these transfers during an off-peak hour, for example. This extension
    introduces the ALTO Cost Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost
    values in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval. The
    time intervals, as well as other Calendar attributes, are specified in the Information
    Resources Directory and ALTO Server responses.</p>"
