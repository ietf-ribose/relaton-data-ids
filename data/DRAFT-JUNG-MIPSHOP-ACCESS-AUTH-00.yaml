abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a secure authentication protocol between
    the MN \n   and NAR(New Access Router) in FMIP6. The main idea is that the MN
    \n   generates an authentication key for handoff, and delivers it to the \n   NAR
    through an existing secure channel via the AAA server during a \n   pre-authentication
    process. The NAR verifies the MN using the \n   delivered key when the MN attaches
    to itself. The main advantage of \n   this scheme over the full authentication
    procedure is to distribute \n   the heavy overhead of the AAA server such as key
    generation and \n   management to the MNs. The AAA server in this scheme just
    forwards \n   the key information to the NAR using an existing secure channel.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
