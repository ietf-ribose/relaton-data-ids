abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MEGACO/H.GCP draft protocol has several structures that are
    not com-\npletely defined, viz, how properties are described and grouped, the
    tem-\nplate concept, the package concept, etc.  There is also an extended\ndebate
    on the encoding of the protocol, and particularly, the encoding\nof the command
    parameters.  This contribution proposes a unified\napproach to all of these issues.
    \ This Internet Draft was rushed to meet\nthe Oslo deadline. As such, it was not
    thoroughly reviewed, especially\nto see that this ID conformed to its referenced
    fundamental ideas on\ncapabilities.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
