abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer modecapability.
    Therefore it is quite natural that there appearsfollowing demands. (1)Transmit
    specific IP flow through a certainisochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus. (2)Transmit
    specific AV flow(such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883]) through a certainisochronous
    channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows by IPapplications). To realize
    these, this draft proposes the protocolwith following features. (1)Notify the
    relation between channel IDand IP flow. (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronouschannel.
    (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted throughthe channel. (4)Notify
    the attribute of the flow. This protocol isdefined as the extension of MCAP (Multicast
    Channel AllocationProtocol).</p>"
