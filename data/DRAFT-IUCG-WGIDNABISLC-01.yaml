abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IDNA is a key issue for the IUCG as a paradigm for the future
    of\nthe Internet. There is therefore a need to make sure its description\ndocument
    set reflects a complete IETF and users consensus. To help\nthis, this memo keeps
    track of the WG-IDNABIS/LC requested and\nreceived answers. The IAB Draft on IDN
    has been added because some\nremarks have been made which are important. The author
    is quoted if\nthe comment is not from IUCG\n\t </p>\n      "
