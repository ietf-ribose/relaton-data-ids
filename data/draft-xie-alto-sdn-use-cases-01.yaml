abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of SDN fundamentally changes the way that the ALTO
    works. This draft describes the Vertical Architecture and the Horizontal Architecture
    allowing coherent coexistence of application layer traffic optimization (ALTO)
    with software defined network (SDN). Unique requirements for design and operations
    are identified and summarized, suggesting that the Vertical Architecture allows
    better division, management, flexibility, privacy control and long- term evolution
    of the network. We also define the main interactions and information flows, and
    present a set of use cases to illustrate how we extend ALTO to support SDN, in
    the Vertical Architecture.</p>"
