abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Subnet Selections option is provided by a DHCP client to DHCP
    a\nserver as an indication to which subnet or subnets to select an address from
    for the client's lease. When present, the DHCP server will use this value as an
    indication to which configured subnet pool of addresses to select from, effectively
    divorcing the giaddr of its overloaded subnet selection function for a packet
    forwarded by a DHCP relay agent. The giaddr is retains its function as the address
    for the DHCP server to send replies to. \n\nAn application for this new option
    would be to allow a Network Access \nServer (NAS) acting as DHCP proxy on behalf
    of a large number of dial-in \nusers to obtain an address that is in the desired
    subnet(s) for the dial \nusers without having to configure multiple giaddr values
    at the NAS, or \nrequiring the NAS to utilize an address within each subnet.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
