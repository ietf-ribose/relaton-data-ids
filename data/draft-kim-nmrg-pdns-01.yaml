abstract:
  content: "<p>With the advent of Software-Defined Networking(SDN), the networkenvironment
    has changed greatly to focus on users, and networkvirtualization technology has
    made great progress. However, networksthat are getting bigger and more advanced
    have become more and morecomplex and difficult to use SDN. In such an environment,
    a networksystem that users can easily access and use is required.In this document
    we propose a more advanced policy-based networkvirtualization system that allows
    users to select policies andprovide networks accordingly, rather than a system
    that simplyvirtualizes a network and shares it with each user.</p>"
