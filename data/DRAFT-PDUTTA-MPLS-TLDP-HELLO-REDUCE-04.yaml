abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Targeted LDP (t-LDP) Hellos are used for establishing adjacencies\n
    \  with non-directly connected peers.  After an LDP session is\n   established
    to a Targeted Peer, there are deployment scenerios where\n   it is not necessary
    to send Targeted LDP Hellos at the configured\n   intervals.  This document proposes
    a mechanism to turn off or reduce\n   the rate of exchange of Targeted LDP Hellos
    after LDP session is\n   established to a peer.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
