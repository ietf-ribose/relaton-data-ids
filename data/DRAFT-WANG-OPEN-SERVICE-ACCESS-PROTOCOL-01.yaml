abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the development of IoT(Internet of Things) technology,\n
    \  everything is interconnected.  Mass IoT data, devices, businesses,\n   and
    services adopt different data descriptions and service access\n   methods, resulting
    in fragmentation issues, such as data\n   heterogeneous, device heterogeneous,
    and application heterogeneous,\n   which hinders the development of the industry.
    \ In order to solve the\n   problem, this draft proposes the requirements for
    IoT smart devices\n   to transmit and control, as well as transmission and protocol\n
    \  interfaces.  It is for the program design, system testing and\n   acceptance,
    and related research.  Structured, unified, and\n   standardized open service
    interconnection model reduces business\n   replication cost and removes service
    barriers to push industrial\n   development.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
