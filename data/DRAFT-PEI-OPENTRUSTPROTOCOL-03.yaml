abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP), a protocol
    to\n   install, update, and delete applications and to manage security\n   configuration
    in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).\n\n   TEEs are used in environments
    where security services should be\n   isolated from a regular operating system
    (often called rich OS).\n   This form of compartmentlization grants a smaller
    codebase access to\n   security sensitive services and restricts communication
    from the rich\n   OS to those security services via mediated access.\n\n\t </p>\n
