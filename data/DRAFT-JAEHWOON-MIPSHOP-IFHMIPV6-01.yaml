abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain\n
    \  its connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) while changing \n   its point
    of attachment. Since, in MIPv6, packets sent from \n   a CN to an MN during handover
    can be lost, several mechanisms \n   such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 have been proposed
    to reduce the \n   number of lost packets. However, such mechanisms still suffer
    \n   from the performance degradation due to not only packet losses \n   but also
    out-of-sequence packets. In this draft, we propose \n   I-FHMIPv6 which integrates
    FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 efficiently. \n   I-FHMIPv6 uses the Flush message and can minimize
    packet losses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
