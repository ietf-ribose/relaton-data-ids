abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ad hoc network has no built-in infra-structure for communication
    \n   among mobile nodes and operates in a stand-alone fashion, or may be \n   connected
    to the public Internet.  The nodes in ad hoc network need  \n   to have the capability
    to maintain or share all the resources of the\n   network in a distributed fashion.
    \ One of the most important \n   resources is the set of IP addresses configured
    with an addressing \n   scheme.  When a new node joins an ad hoc network, it has
    to be \n   assigned a unique IP address or autoconfigure its own IP address as
    \n   part of its initialization.  Since ad hoc network's topology may \n   change
    unpredictably, it is important to provide a resilient method \n   for providing
    mobile nodes with such an IP address autoconfiguration\n   in distributive environments.
    \ This document specifies the \n   requirements for IP address autoconfiguration
    in ad hoc networks \n   which have dynamic network topology.\n\t </p>\n      "
