abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE has defined P802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) for
    managing bridged LAN networks. The IETF has defined L2 Virtual Private Networks
    (VPNs) that provide an emulated LAN service for such bridged networks. These L2
    VPNs are created using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudo wires
    (PWs). The IETF has also defined Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
    for managing these PWs. This memo discusses the ability of a combination of CFM
    and VCCV to meet the OAM requirements of a L2 VPN.</p>"
