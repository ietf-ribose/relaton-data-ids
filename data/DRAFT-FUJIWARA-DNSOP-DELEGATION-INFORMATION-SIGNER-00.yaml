abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNSSEC does not protect delegation information, it contains
    NS RRSet\n   on the parent side and glue records.  This document defines\n   delegation
    information signer (DiS) resource record for protecting\n   the delegation information,
    by inserting on the parent side of zone\n   cut to hold a hash of delegation information.
    \ The DiS resource\n   record reuses the type code and wire format of DS resource
    record,\n   and distinguishes it from existing DS RRSet by using a new digest\n
    \  type.  This document also describes the usage of DiS resource record\n   and
    shows the implications on security-aware resolvers.  The\n   definition and usage
    are compatible with current DNSSEC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
