abstract:
  content: "<p>As the Internet Protocol continues to increase in popularity as aglobal
    communication system, it becomes increasingly valuable to beable to use familiar
    IP tools such as ftp for local communication aswell. For example, two people with
    laptop computers with built-inwireless Ethernet may meet and wish to exchange
    files. It isdesirable for these people to be able to use IP application softwarewithout
    the inconvenience of having to manually configure static IPaddresses or set up
    a DHCP [RFC 2131] server.This draft describes a method by which a host may automaticallyconfigure
    an interface with an IP address in the 169.254/16 rangethat is valid for link-local
    communication on that interface. Thisis especially valuable in environments where
    no other configurationmechanism is available.</p>"
