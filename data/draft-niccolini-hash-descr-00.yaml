abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is concerned with the specification and properties of
    Hash Functions for packet selection in PSAMP. Having a detailed and exhaustive
    description of the Hash Function, in terms of input parameters, output value,
    selection range and internal operations is fundamental for coherent configuration
    of the same hash based selection at different points in the network. This coherency
    is fundamental for all network measurement applications needing consistent packet
    selection.</p>"
