abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS), such as Remote Integrity\n
    \  VERification (RIVER), the creation of Entity Attestation Tokens\n   (EAT),
    software integrity Measurement And ATtestation (MAAT), or the\n   attestation
    of device characteristics, in general, are based on\n   specific operations and
    qualities provided by hardware and software.\n   The RATS architecture maps corresponding
    functions and operation\n   capabilities to specific RATS roles.  The goal is
    to enable an\n   appropriate conveyance of believable evidence about device health
    or\n   trusted claims about device capabilities via network protocols.  The\n
    \  flows of data between these roles depend on the composition of RATS\n   roles
    and their location with respect to devices or services.  The\n   RATS architecture
    provides these roles as building blocks to enable\n   suitable composition, while
    remaining hardware-agnostic.  This\n   flexibility is intended to address a significant
    majority of use\n   cases or usage scenarios in the domain of RATS.  Examples
    include,\n   but are not limited to: financial transactions, voting machines,\n
    \  critical safety systems, network equipment health, or trustworthy\n   end-user
    device management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
