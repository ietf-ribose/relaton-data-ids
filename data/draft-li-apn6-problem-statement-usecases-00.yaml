abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators are facing the challenges of providing better network services
    for users. As the ever-developing 5G and industrial verticals evolve, more and
    more services that have diverse network requirements such as ultra-low latency
    and high reliability are emerging and accessing the network, differentiated service
    treatments are desired by users. However, operators are still not aware of applications,
    which cause that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users. As a result,
    operators are only evolving to be large but dumb pipes without corresponding revenue
    increase. As the network technologies evolve including deployments of IPv6 and
    SRv6, the programmability provided by IPv6 and SRv6 encapsulations can be augmented
    by conveying the application related information into the network. Adding application
    knowledge to the network layer, allow applications to specify finer granularity
    requirements, which eventually bridges network and applications. This document
    analyzes the existing problems of the current operators in the application awareness,
    and outlines various use cases that could benefit from the Application-aware IPv6
    Networking (APN6).</p>"
