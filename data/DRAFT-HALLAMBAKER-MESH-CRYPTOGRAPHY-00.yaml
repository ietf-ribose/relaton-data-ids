abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an infrastructure that\n
    \  facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between\n   multiple
    user devices and provides end-to-end security.  This\n   document describes the
    advanced encryption services supported by the\n   Mesh.\n\n   This document is
