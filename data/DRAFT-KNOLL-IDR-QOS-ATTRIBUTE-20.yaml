abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter-\n
    \  domain QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended\n   Community.
    \ Class based packet marking and forwarding is currently\n   performed independently
    within ASes.  The new QoS marking community\n   makes the targeted Per Hop Behaviour
    within the IP prefix advertising\n   AS and the currently applied marking at the
    interconnection point\n   known to all access and transit ASes.  This enables
    individual\n   (re-)marking and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the\n
    \  original QoS class setup of the respective originating AS.  The\n   extended
    community provides the means to signal QoS markings on\n   different layers, which
    are linked together in QoS Class Sets.  It\n   provides inter-domain and cross-layer
    insight into the QoS class\n   mapping of the source AS with minimal signalling
    traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
