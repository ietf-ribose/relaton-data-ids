abstract:
- content: "<p>When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol, it can
    be desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a particular
    message. It can also be desirable to ensure that the message was not tampered
    with during transit. This document describes a way for servers and clients to
    simultaneously add authentication and message integrity to HTTP messages by using
    a digital signature.</p>"
