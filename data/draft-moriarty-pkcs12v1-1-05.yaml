abstract:
- content: "<p>PKCS #12 v1.1 describes a transfer syntax for personal identity information,
    including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous secrets, and extensions. Machines,
    applications, browsers, Internet kiosks, and so on, that support this standard
    will allow a user to import, export, and exercise a single set of personal identity
    information. This standard supports direct transfer of personal information under
    several privacy and integrity modes. This document represents a republication
    of PKCS #12 v1.1 from RSA Laboratories' Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS)
    series. By publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF.</p>"
