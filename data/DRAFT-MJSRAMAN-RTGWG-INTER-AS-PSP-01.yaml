abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate
    power\n   consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n
    \  Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and
    then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets\n   along the
    paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the\n   available power-to-bandwidth
    (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint\n   in the Constrained Shortest Path First
    (CSPF) algorithm. For re-\n   routing the data traffic through these low-power
    paths, the Inter-AS\n   Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
    multiple\n   AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can\n
    \  be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby\n   creating
    a collaborative approach to reduce the power consumption.\n   Since calculating
    the low-power paths can be computationally\n   intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic
    is also proposed. This\n   heuristic reduces the computational complexity but
    may provide a sub-\n   optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our approaches
    is\n   illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.\n   The
    techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power\n   reduction require
    minimal modifications to the existing features of\n   the Internet. The proposed
    techniques can be extended to other levels\n   of Internet hierarchy, such as
    Intra-AS paths, through suitable\n   modifications.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
