abstract:
- content: "<p>Spine and leaf topologies are widely used in hyperscale and cloud scale
    networks. In most of these networks, configuration is automated, but difficult,
    and topology information is extracted through broad based connections. Policy
    is often integrated into the control plane, as well, making configuration, management,
    and troubleshooting difficult. Openfabric is an adaptation of an existing, widely
    deployed link state protocol, Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    that is designed to: o Provide a full view of the topology from a single point
    in the network to simplify operations o Minimize configuration of each Intermediate
    System (IS) (also called a router or switch) in the network o Optimize the operation
    of IS-IS within a spine and leaf fabric to enable scaling This document begins
    with an overview of openfabric, including a description of what may be removed
    from IS-IS to enable scaling. The document then describes an optimized adjacency
    formation process; an optimized flooding scheme; some thoughts on the operation
    of openfabric, metrics, and aggregation; and finally a description of the changes
    to the IS-IS protocol required for openfabric.</p>"
