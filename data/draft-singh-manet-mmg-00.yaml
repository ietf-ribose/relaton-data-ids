abstract:
- content: "<p>MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork) allows users to form a private wireless
    network, without existing centralized administrator that support multi-hop communication
    and low network establishment cost. Recently some interesting work has been published
    to allow manet node access to the Internet via internet gateway which is placed
    on the border of manet and the Internet. The Internet gateway has an important
    role to support global connectivity. This document introduces the management of
    internet gateway, routing policy and load balancing for the scenario where multiple
    mobile gateways exist for an ad hoc network.</p>"
