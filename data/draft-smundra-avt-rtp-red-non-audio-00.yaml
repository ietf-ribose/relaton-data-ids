abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an RTP payload format for encoding redundant
    non-audio data for use with RFC 2198 redundancy scheme. The primary motivation
    for the payload format described herein is accurate loss detection and sequencing,
    and to make the redundancy mechanism independent of clock rate being used for
    non-audio data. It is hoped that use of this payload format will simplify the
    implementation of RFC 2198 redundancy mechanism for non-audio data and may improve
    efficiency of redundancy mechanism if RTCP extended reports (XR) were available
    to RTP senders.</p>"
