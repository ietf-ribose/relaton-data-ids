abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IS-41 mobility-related parameters (WIN information
    and its encoding) which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the PSTN (wireline,
    as well as wireless) into the IP network. The SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through
    which PSTN can request actions (services) to be carried out in the IP network
    in response to events occurring within the PSTN/IN (wireline, as well as wireless).
    This draft outlines, what IS-41 mobility-ralated parameters are of immediate interest
    to SPIRITS, how they may be extracted and encoded for use within the SPIRITS domain.
    IS-41 is used as an example protocol to clarify the SPIRITS message encoding process.
    This Internet-Draft has been written in response to the SPIRITS WG chairs' call
    for SPIRITS Protocol proposals. It may be viewed as being a direct contribution
    to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS protocol parameters. Section 1 of this
    document gives background of wireless cellular communication networks, including
    Core Networks, Section 2 gives a backgrouder for the Wireless Intelligent Network
    (WIN). Sections 3 and 4 briefly explain WIN Functional and Physical entities.
    Section 5 provides WIN BCSM Description. Section 6 gives ASN.1 Notation for the
    selected WIN Parameters. Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 respectively provide Acknowledgements,
    References, Author's Address, Acronyms and Full Copyright Statement, as required.
    Addendum 1 contains figures.</p>"
