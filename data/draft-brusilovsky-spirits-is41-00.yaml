abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes IS-41 mobility-related parameters (WINinformation
    and its encoding) which the SPIRITS protocol cantransport from the PSTN (wireline,
    as well as wireless) into the IPnetwork. The SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through
    which PSTN canrequest actions (services) to be carried out in the IP network inresponse
    to events occurring within the PSTN/IN (wireline, as well as wireless). This draft
    outlines, what IS-41 mobility-ralatedparameters are of immediate interest to SPIRITS,
    how they may beextracted and encoded for use within the SPIRITS domain. IS-41
    isused as an example protocol to clarify the SPIRITS message encodingprocess.
    This Internet-Draft has been written in response to theSPIRITS WG chairs' call
    for SPIRITS Protocol proposals. It may beviewed as being a direct contribution
    to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS protocol parameters. Section 1 of this
    document givesbackground of wireless cellular communication networks, includingCore
    Networks, Section 2 gives a backgrouder for the WirelessIntelligent Network (WIN).
    Sections 3 and 4 briefly explain WINFunctional and Physical entities. Section
    5 provides WIN BCSMDescription. Section 6 gives ASN.1 Notation for the selected
    WINParameters. Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 respectively provideAcknowledgements,
    References, Author's Address, Acronyms and FullCopyright Statement, as required.
    Addendum 1 contains figures.</p>"
