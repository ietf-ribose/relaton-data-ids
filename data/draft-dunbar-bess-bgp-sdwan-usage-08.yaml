abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes three distinct SDWAN scenarios and discusses
    the applicability of BGP for each of those scenarios. The goal of the document
    is to demonstrate how BGP-based control plane is used for large scale SDWAN overlay
    networks with little manual intervention. SDWAN edge nodes are commonly interconnected
    by multiple underlay networks which can be owned and managed by different network
    providers.</p>"
