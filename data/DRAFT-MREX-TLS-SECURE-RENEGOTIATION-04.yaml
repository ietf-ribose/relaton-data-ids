abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves
    all\ncurrently implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2)\nvulnerable
    to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where the attacker can\nestablish a TLS session
    with a server, send crafted application data\nof his choice to the server and
    then proxy an unsuspecting client's\nTLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation
    handshake of the server. \nMany applications on top of TLS see the data injected
    by the attacker\nand the data sent by the client as a single data stream and assume\nthat
    an authentication during the TLS renegotiation handshake or\ncontained in the
    client's application data applies to the entire data\nstream received through
    the TLS-protected communication channel.\n\nThis document describes a protocol
    change for all protocol versions\nof TLS and SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability
    for all\ncommunication between updated TLS clients and updated TLS servers.\n\t
