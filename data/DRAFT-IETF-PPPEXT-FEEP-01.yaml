abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard
    method\n        for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point\n
    \       links\n \n        PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol,
    which\n        allows negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for\n        authentication
    of its peer before allowing Network Layer\n        protocols to transmit over
    the link.\n \n        One of the Authentication protocols that can be negotiated
    is\n        the EAP.  The EAP can be used in any of a number of variants.\n        When
    the EAP is used in it's KEA variant, this results in mutual\n        authentication
    and key generation.  This key is available for\n        use during the PPP data
    transfer phase by an encryption\n        encapsulation.  The encryption encapsulation
    that is described\n        in this memo is one possible encapsulation that can
    use the\n        keying material generated by the EAP KEA protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
