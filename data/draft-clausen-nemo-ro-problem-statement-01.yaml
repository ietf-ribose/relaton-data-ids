abstract:
- content: "<p>The NEMO basic support specification is not limited to a single level
    of mobile networks attaching to the stationary Internet. Rather, arbitrary levels
    of nested mobile networks are supported, employing for each level of nesting the
    same attachment, encapsulation and tunnelling mechanisms. With arbitrarily deep
    nested mobile networks, paths taken by data traffic can be extremely sub-optimal
    both inside the nested topology through successive mobile routers, and outside
    the nested topology, through successive Home Agents over the Internet. Moreover,
    the overhead incurred through tunnelling and encapsulation of data traffic can
    become prohibitively large. This document analyses the scenarios in which these
    problems are particularly acute.</p>"
