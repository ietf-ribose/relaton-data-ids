abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, the M-PIN FULL protocol for two factor\n
    \  authentication and key exchange is described. This protocol mutually\n   identifies
    a Client to a Server and the Server to the Client, and\n   agrees between them
    a cryptographic strong encryption key for\n   subsequent communication. M-PIN
    FULL requires an external Trusted\n   Authority to issue secrets to participating
    Clients and Servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
