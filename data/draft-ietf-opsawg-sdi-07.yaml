abstract:
- content: '<p>Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has
    no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to the location
    to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared datacenters with
    "smart-hands" type support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there were
    a secure way to initially provision the device. This document extends existing
    auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning mechanisms to make the process more secure.
