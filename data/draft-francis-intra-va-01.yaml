abstract:
  content: "<p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of themost costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade routerhardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and routervendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    FIB suppressionis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selectedRIB
    entries into the FIB. Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs toshrink the FIBs of
    any and all routers, easily by an order ofmagnitude with negligible increase in
    path length and load. FIBsuppression deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation
    between ISPsis not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</p>"
