abstract:
- content: "<p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the most costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected
    RIB entries into the FIB. Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs
    of any and all routers, easily by an order of magnitude with negligible increase
    in path length and load. FIB suppression deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation
    between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</p>"
