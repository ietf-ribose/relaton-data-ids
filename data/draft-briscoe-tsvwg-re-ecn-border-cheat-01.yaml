abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.A
    recently proposed approach combines Diffserv and pre-congestionnotification (PCN)
    to provide a service slightly better than Intservcontrolled load. It scales to
    networks of any size, but only ifdomains trust each other to comply with admission
    control and ratepolicing. This memo claims to solve this trust problem withoutlosing
    scalability. It describes bulk border policing that providesa sufficient emulation
    of per-flow policing with the help of anotherrecently proposed extension to ECN,
    involving re-echoing ECN feedback(re-ECN). With only passive bulk measurements
    at borders, sanctionscan be applied against cheating networks.</p>"
