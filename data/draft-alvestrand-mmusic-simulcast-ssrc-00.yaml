abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a convention for sending "a=ssrc" attributes
    in SDP together with "a=simulcast" attributes. This allows SFUs that need SSRC
    information to have this info easily accessible. Given that it is intended as
    an interim measure, it does not aim for being published as an RFC.</p>
