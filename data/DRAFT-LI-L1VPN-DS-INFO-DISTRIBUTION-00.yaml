abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a Directory Server based VPN membership
    \ninformation distribution mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The mechanism \nenables
    PEs to discover which other PEs have ports attached to CEs \nthat are members
    of the same VPN, and allows PEs to discover \nattributes of currently configured
    CE-PE links and their associations \nwith layer-1 VPNs. This document builds on
    the Layer One VPN \nFramework and provides an auto-discovery mechanism as discussed
    in \nthe Layer One VPN Basic Mode document. This mechanism may be applied \nto
    the layer-1 VPN basic mode.\n\t </p>\n      "
