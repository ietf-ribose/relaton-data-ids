abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Metering is typically performed at the edge of a Diffserv-aware
    \nnetwork where customer traffic is checked for conformance or else \nwhere networks
    interconnect using shaping/policing as a practical \nmatter in IP networks. This
    document describes the importance of the \nconsistent metering in Diffserv traffic
    conditioning. This document \nalso proposes the concepts and the associated details
    to be adapted \nby Diffserv informal model [DIFFSERV-MODEL] to achieve the desired
    \nconsistency.\n\t </p>\n      "
