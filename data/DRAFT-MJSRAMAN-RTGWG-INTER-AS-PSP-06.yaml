abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate
    power\n   consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n
    \  Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and
    then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets\n   along the
    paths. Such low-power paths can be identified by using the\n   consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth
    (PWR) ratio as an additional\n   constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First
    (CSPF) algorithm.\n   For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power
    paths, the\n   Inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans\n
    \  multiple AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol\n   (BGP)
    can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS\n   thereby creating
    a collaborative approach to reduce the power\n   consumption. Since calculating
    the low-power paths can be\n   computationally intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic
    is also\n   proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational complexity but
    may\n   provide a sub-optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our\n   approaches
    is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of\n   the Internet. The
    techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS\n   power reduction require
    minimal modifications to the existing\n   features of the Internet. The proposed
    techniques can be extended to\n   other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as
    Intra-AS paths, through\n   suitable modifications.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
