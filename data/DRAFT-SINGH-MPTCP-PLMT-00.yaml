abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The single path transport provided by the Transmission Control\nProtocol
    (TCP) can be extended to a multipath transport session for\nmulti-homed end hosts
    by coupling several TCP connections over\nmultiple interfaces of the end hosts.
    Payload Multi-connection\nTransport (PLMT) is a multipath protocol variant that
    encodes all\nthe control/signaling information in the payload of TCP connections\nand
    therefore requires no additional TCP options. PLMT allows for\nthe simultaneous
    use of the multiple connections over potentially\ndisjoint paths while being mostly
    backward compatible to single path\ntransport of TCP. PLMT operates as an additional
    protocol layer\nbetween the network stack and the application layer. This document\ndescribes
    PLMT as an example for a multipath mechanism that could\npossibly be realized
    entirely in the user-space of an operating\nsystem.\n\t </p>\n      "
