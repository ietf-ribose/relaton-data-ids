abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of
    standard\n   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n
    \  communication.  The security needs are well-recognized and and many\n   standardization
    steps for providing security have been taken, for\n   example, the specification
    of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n   over Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS).  However, security\n   challenges still exist and there are some use cases
    that lack a\n   suitable solution.  In this document, we first discuss the various\n
    \  stages in the lifecycle of a thing.  We then look at the security\n   building
    blocks available for securing the different layers of the\n   Internet protocol
    suite.  Next, we document the various security\n   threats to a thing and the
    challenges that one might face in order to\n   protect against these threats.
    \ Lastly, we discuss the next steps\n   needed to ensure roll out of secure Internet
    of Things services.\n\n   This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing
    Research Group\n   (T2TRG).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
