abstract:
- content: "<p>The target of DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is to provide
    an open and standard in-network storage system for applications, primarily P2P
    applications, to store, retrieve and manage their data. This draft enumerates
    and explains requirements, not only for store and retrieve, but also for data
    management, access control and resource control, that should be considered during
    the design and implementation of a DECADE system. These are requirements on the
    entire system, some of the requirements may eventually be implemented by an existing
    protocol with/without some extensions (e.g. the data transport level), but a user
    of DECADE as a complete architecture would be guaranteed such functionality.</p>"
