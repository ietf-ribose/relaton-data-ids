abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a simple revision to Route Reflection thatallows
    a Route Reflector to send a route advertisement (instead of aroute withdraw) in
    certain cases. The route advertisement helpsnarrow the gap between Route Reflection
    and IBGP full-mesh in termsof routing information. It has been shown that the
    proposed mechanismhelps achieve stable route selection and eliminate a number
    ofpersistent route oscillations involving Route Reflection.</p>"
