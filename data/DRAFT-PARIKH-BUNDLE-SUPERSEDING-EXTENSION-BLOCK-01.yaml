abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an optional Bundle Protocol block called
    the\nSuperseding Bundle Extension Block (SBEB) for use with the Bundle\nProtocol
    in the context of the Delay-Tolerant Networking\nArchitecture.  Applications use
    this block to call for the removal of\npreviously sent bundles that are rendered
    obsolete by more recent\nbundles.  Upon receiving a bundle with an SBEB, a node
    will search\nits bundle store (and outbound queues) for bundles that are obsoleted\nby
    other related bundles according to their source and destination\nEID, and the
    SBEB cookie (if present), and may delete some or all of\nthem.  Discarding obsolete
    bundles helps conserve storage space and\nprevents expending resources in further
    forwarding bundles that are\nno longer relevant.  The bundle protocol already
    uses expiration\ntimes to remove bundles that are no longer useful to applications.\nThe
    SBEB is a way for applications to mark bundles that a node may\ndelete prior to
    their expiration times.\n\t </p>\n      "
