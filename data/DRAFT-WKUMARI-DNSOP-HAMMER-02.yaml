abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple DNS cache optimization which
    keeps\n   the most popular records in the DNS cache: Highly Automated Method\n
    \  for Maintaining Expiring Records (HAMMER).  The principle is that\n   records
    in the cache are fetched, that is to say resolved before\n   their TTL expires
    and the record is flushed from the cache.  By\n   fetching Records before they
    are being queried by an end user, HAMMER\n   is expected to improve the quality
    of experience of the end users as\n   well as to optimize the resources involved
    in large DNSSEC resolving\n   platforms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
