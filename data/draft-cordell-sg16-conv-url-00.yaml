abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The evolving technologies for real-time conversation over the Internetrequire
    URLs to provide user contact information. As there are manyprotocols (including
    some that are not Internet based) that can be usedfor inter-user conversation,
    this document describes a two stagetransaction process for obtaining a URL that
    can be used to initiateconversation. The first stage involves retrieving a list
    of protocolspecific URLs in a MIME encoded file. The MIME type enables anappropriate
    application to be launched which will analyse the presentedURLs and select the
    most appropriate one. The second stage involvesinterpreting the protocol specific
    URL and initiating the conversation.The protocol specific URLs are encoded in
    a URL form so that they can beembedded directly into HTML pages. This allows the
    first stage to beomitted. The document describes the format of the MIME encoded
    list ofURLs, and the format of a number of protocol specific URLs.</p>"
