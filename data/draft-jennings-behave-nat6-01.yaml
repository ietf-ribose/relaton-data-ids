abstract:
  content: "<p>This specification defines a NAT that allows IPv6-only hosts that areinside
    the NAT to operate with IPv4 hosts that are outside the NAT.It requires no modifications
    to the v4 hosts or applications, or tothe operating system of v6 hosts, but it
    does require some changes tov6 applications. Typically this specification would
    be used to allowthe hosts inside a NAT to connect to hosts outside it; but under
    somelimitations, it can also allow hosts outside to connect to hostsinside.The
    goal of this draft is to consider what is the minimal feasibleapproach to this
    problem. The current intention is to merge thiswith the nat64 draft. This draft
    is being discussed on thebehave@ietf.org list.</p>"
