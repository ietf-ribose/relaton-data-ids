abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability statement for the use of UDP
    transport checksums when used with IPv6. This defines recommendations and requirements
    for use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a zero checksum. It examines the role of the
    IPv6 UDP transport checksum, as defined in RFC2460 and presents a summary of the
    trade- offs for evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460 to permit an IPv6 UDP
    endpoint to use a zero value in the checksum field as an indication that no checksum
    is present. This method is compared with some other possibilities. The document
    also describes the issues and design principles that need to be considered when
    UDP is used with IPv6 to support tunnel encapsulations. XXX NOTE - This revision
    is a partial response to comments received during IESG review. There are additional
    comments to be incorporated - and updates anticipated to the related PS that updates
    IPv6. This is therefore an interim version. XXX</p>"
