abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field
    or\n   green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n
    \  BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P)
    core network as well as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4\n   to IPv6.
    \ Operators must be able to continue to support IPv4\n   customers when both the
    Core and Edge networks are IPv6-Only.\n\n   This document details an important
    External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge\n   IPv6-Only peering design that leverages the
    MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing
    both IPv4\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border\n   Gateway
    Protocol) BGP TCP session.  The design change provides the\n   same Dual Stacking
    functionality that exists today with separate IPv4\n   and IPv6 BGP sessions as
    we have today.  With this design change from\n   a control plane perspective a
    single IPv6 is required for both IPv4\n   and IPv6 routing updates and from a
    data plane forwarindg perspective\n   an IPv6 address need only be configured
    on the PE and CE interface\n   for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding.\n\n   This
    document provides a much needed solution for Internet Exchange\n   Point (IXP)
    that are facing IPv4 address depletion at large peering\n   points.  With this
    design, IXP can now deploy PE-CE IPv6-Only eBGP\n   Edge peering design to eliminate
    IPv4 provisioning at the Edge.  This\n   core and edge IPv6-Only peering design
    paradigm change can apply to\n   any eBGP peering, public internet or private,
    which can be either\n   Core networks, Data Center networks, Access networks or
    can be any\n   eBGP peering scenario.  This document provides vendor specific
    test\n   cases for the IPv6-Only peering design as well as test results for\n
    \  the five major vendors stakeholders in the routing and switching\n   indusrty,
    Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.  With the test\n   results provided
    for the IPv6-Only Edge peering design, the goal is\n   that all other vendors
    around the world that have not been tested\n   will begin to adopt and implement
    this new Best Current Practice for\n   eBGP IPv6-Only Edge peering.\n\n   As this
    issue with IXP IPv4 address depletion is a critical issue\n   around the world,
    it is imperative for an immediate solution that can\n   be implemented quickly.
    \ This Best Current Practice IPv6-only eBGP\n   peering design specification will
    help proliferate IPv6-Only\n   deployments at the eBGP Edge network peering points
    to starting\n   immediately at a minimum with operators around the world using
    Cisco,\n   Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.  As other vendors start to\n   implement
    this Best Current Practice, the IXP IPv4 address depletion\n   gap will eventually
    be eliminated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
