abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines media types for representing the
    future\n   price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device,\n
    \  such as a car, refrigerator, air conditioner, water heater, or\n   display
    to discover a web server that can provide the future price\n   for local electrical
    energy.  This will allow the client device to\n   make intelligent decisions about
    when to use energy, and enable price\n   distribution when the building is off-grid.
    \ It enables obtaining\n   price from a local or non-local price server.\n\n   This
    draft is an early skeleton of a draft to start discussion around\n   this idea.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
