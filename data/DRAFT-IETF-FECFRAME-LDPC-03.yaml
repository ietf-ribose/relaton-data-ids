abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme
    for LDPC-\n   Staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along
    the\n   lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.  These codes have many\n   interesting
    properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close\n   to ideal codes in
    many use-cases and they also feature very high\n   encoding and decoding throughputs.
    \ LDPC-Staircase codes are\n   therefore a good solution to protect a single high
    bitrate source\n   flow, or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within
    a single\n   FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the\n
    \  processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a\n   minimum.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
