abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines Access Router Information Protocol (ARIP)\nwhereby
    a mobile host can improve the handoff performance by\nexchanging, in advance,
    the information among geographically\nadjacent access router(AR)s. This protocol
    does not need a certain\nassumption of network topology so that it can be applied
    to\nheterogeneous networks as well as homogeneous networks. This document\nalso
    describes a framework to minimize the handoff latency with the\naid of ARIP. Therefore,
    ARIP can be combined with the protocol such as\nFast Handovers (for Mobile IPv6)
    which tries to minimize the handoff\nlatency.\n\t </p>\n      "
