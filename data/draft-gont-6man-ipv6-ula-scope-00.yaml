abstract:
- content: <p>Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) are formally part of the
    IPv6 Global Unicast address space. However, the semantics of ULAs clearly contradict
    the definition of "global scope". This document discusses the why the terminology
    employed for the specification of ULAs is problematic, along with some practical
    consequences of the current specification of ULAs. Finally, it formally updates
    RFC4291 and RFC4193 such that the scope of ULAs is defined as "local".</p>
