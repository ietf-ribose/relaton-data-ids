abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures problems and issues discovered at SCTP bakeoff's
    and on the sigtran mailing list. This document will be updated after each bakeoff
    augmenting the existing draft to include any new issues discovered during inter-operability
    testing. Two basic sets of problems are identified by this draft: first, issues
    that need to be addressed when the next revision of SCTP is created, i.e. issues
    that should be remembered in a BIS document; second, issues that were found that
    are strictly implementation problems.</p>"
