abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>                    This document generally describes how to use
    an Adaptive Forward \n                    Error Correction (AFEC) algorithm to
    efficiently protect the \n                    compressed header vital data as
    well as UDP-Liteâ€™s vital data for \n                    data transport in the
    radio-link layer of an error-prone wireless \n                    connection.
    Augmented with RoHC and UDP-Lite, for video \n                    transmissions
    over wireless channels in a heterogeneous wired-\n                    wireless
    environment, the erroneous packet payloads can be useful \n                    and
    the applications better able to cope with lost packets (native \n                    UDP
    case), by adopting some of the erasure and error resilient \n                    modes
    in the latest video codecs, such as H.264. The context \n                    transfer
    in the inter/intra handover is also covered. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
