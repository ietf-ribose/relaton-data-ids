abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired
    by\n   HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP.  The message layer of\n   the
    CoAP over UDP protocol includes support for reliable delivery,\n   simple congestion
    control, and flow control.\n\n   Some environments benefit from the availability
    of CoAP carried over\n   reliable transports such as TCP or TLS.  This document
    outlines the\n   changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets\n
    \  transports.  It also formally updates RFC 7641 for use with these\n   transports
    and RFC 7959 to enable the use of larger messages over a\n   reliable transport.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
