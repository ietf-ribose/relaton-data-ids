abstract:
- content: <p>Pseudowires are sometimes used to carry non-TCP data flows. In these
    circumstances the service payload will not react to network congestion by reducing
    its offered load. Pseudowires should therefore reduces their network bandwidth
    demands in the face of significant packet loss, including if necessary completely
    ceasing transmission. Since it is difficult to determine a priori the number of
    equivalent TCP flow that a pseudowire represents, a suitably "fair" rate of back-off
    cannot be pre-determined. This document describes pseudowire congestion problem
    and provides guidance on the development suitable solutions.</p>
