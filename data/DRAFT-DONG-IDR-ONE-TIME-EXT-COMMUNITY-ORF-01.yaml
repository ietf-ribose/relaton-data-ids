abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type
    for\n   BGP, termed \"One-time Extended Community Outbound Route Filter\",\n   which
    would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route\n   refresh request
    with a set of extended-community-based filters to\n   make the peer re-advertise
    only the specific routes matching the\n   filters to the speaker.  This ORF-type
    enables a BGP speaker to\n   refresh some specific routes without requiring its
    peer to re-\n   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out, which makes the route refresh\n
    \  operation more efficient and reduces the impact on network stability.\n   This
    filter does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers\n   and should
    only be used for one-time filtering.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
