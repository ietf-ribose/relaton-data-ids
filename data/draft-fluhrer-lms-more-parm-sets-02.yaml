abstract:
- content: "<p>This note extends LMS (RFC 8554) by defining parameter sets by including
    additional hash functions. Hese include hash functions that result in signatures
    with significantly smaller than the signatures using the current parameter sets,
    and should have sufficient security. This document is a product of the Crypto
    Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
