abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the crash recovery mechanism for the Open Digital
    Asset Protocol (ODAP), called ODAP-2PC. The goal is to assure gateways running
    ODAP to be able to recover from crashes, and thus preserve the consistency of
    an asset across ledgers (i.e., double spend does not occur). This draft includes
    the description of the messaging and logging flow necessary for the correct functioning
    of ODAP-2PC.</p>"
