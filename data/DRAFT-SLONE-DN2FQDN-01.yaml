abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) request must be
    \ndirected to an appropriate server for processing. This document \nspecifies
    an extension to the Domain Name System (DNS) and specifies \na method for discovering
    such servers using information in DNS.  \nThis document complements and enhances
    previously specified methods \nof locating an appropriate server in that it works
    for distinguished \nnames constructed with or without the 'dc' attribute type.
    \n    \n   The DNS extension is specified as an AVA Resource Record.  The \n   method
    of discovering servers queries DNS for AVA records to resolve \n   a DN to a fully
    qualified domain name, then queries DNS for SRV \n   records to complete the location
    process.\n\t </p>\n      "
