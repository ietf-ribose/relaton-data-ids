abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   If we model the system of Internet names as a set of directed
    graphs\n   in an absolute naming context, following RFC 819, an Internet name
    is\n   not necessarily a name in the domain name system, but is simply a\n   unique
    name associated with a particular directed graph.  The\n   resolution of the name,
    in other words, is independent from it being\n   an \"Internet name\".  The DNS
    is a common, but not the only,\n   resolution context for Internet names.  This
    document discusses the\n   consequences of the need to select among multiple resolution\n
    \  contexts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
