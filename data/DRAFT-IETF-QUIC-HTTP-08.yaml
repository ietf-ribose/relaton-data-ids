abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable\n
    \  in a transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow\n   control,
    and low-latency connection establishment.  This document\n   describes a mapping
    of HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also\n   identifies HTTP/2 features
    that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes\n   how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported
    to QUIC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
