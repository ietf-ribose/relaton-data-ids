abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) [RFC6347] as a transport protocol between a Traversal Using Relays around
    NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] client and a TURN server. It also specifies modifications
    to the TURN URIs [RFC7065] and to the TURN resolution mechanism [RFC5928] to facilitate
    the resolution of TURN URIs into the IP address and port of TURN servers supporting
    DTLS as a transport protocol.</p>"
