abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards\ntrack
    within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the\nlevel of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow,\ndespite the demand for technologies
    offering services with different\nlevels of quality of service to their customers.
    This memo seeks to\ninitiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1,
    called\nRSVPv2, that meet the requirements formulated by IETF NSIS working\ngroup.
    It also outlines the motivation for using RSVP2 as 'next step\nin signaling'.\nThe
    RSVPv2 framework uses the layer-split architecture separating\nsignaling application
    and transport functions. This concept was\nadopted by NSIS WG and the two layers
    are called NSLP NSIS Signaling\nLayer Protocol (NSLP) and NSIS Transport Layer
    Protocol (NTLP). This\ndraft provides design guidelines and specifications for
    the\ndevelopment of the RSVPv2 NSLP part.\nRSVP2-NSLP offers increased modularity
    and contains less mandatory\nobjects compared to RSVPv1, which allow lightweight
    implementation\nand flexible application. The new protocol is extended with PHR
    and\nPDR objects that makes it possible to use the protocol in different\npart
    of multi-domain networks and use the protocol in DiffServ\nenvironment.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
