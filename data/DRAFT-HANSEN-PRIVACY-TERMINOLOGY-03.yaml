abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout
    the\n   last few millennia by all manner of people.  Its most striking\n   feature
    is that nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition\n   of what it actually
    is.  In order to discuss privacy in any\n   meaningful way a tightly defined context
    needs to be elucidated.  The\n   specific context of privacy used within this
    document is that of\n   \"personal data\", information about an individual stored
    and/or\n   transmitted electronically in Internet protocols.  This context is\n
    \  highly relevant since a lot of work within the IETF involves defining\n   protocols
    that can potentially transport (either explicitly or\n   implicitly) personal
    data.\n\n   This document aims to establish a basic lexicon around privacy so\n
    \  that IETF contributors who wish to discuss privacy considerations\n   within
    their work can do so using terminology consistent across the\n   area.\n\n   Note:
    This document is discussed at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
