abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents a framework document for modeling network\n
    \  elements (NE), facilities, lines, protocols and services for\n   substantially
    easing development and operation of element manager\n   systems (EMS), network
    management systems (NMS) and operations\n   support systems (OSS).  The framework
    is independent of the access\n   method used, including SNMP, CLI, Netconf, Corba,
    CMIP, XML-RPC,\n   etc.)  It covers configuration, alarms, current-historical\n
    \  performance, accounting management and security.  The frameworks\n   builds
    on and reuses the existing base of MIBs.  The documents\n   presents a light-weight,
    structured and very simplified framework and\n   method to data modeling for defining
    and maintaining meta models,\n   device etc. models, and device etc. descriptors.\n\t
