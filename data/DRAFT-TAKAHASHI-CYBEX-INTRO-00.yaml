abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The cybersecurity information exchange framework, known as
    CYBEX, is\n   currently undergoing its first iteration of standardization efforts\n
    \  within ITU-T.  The framework describes how cybersecurity information\n   is
    exchanged between cybersecurity entities on a global scale and how\n   the exchange
    is assured.  This framework is intended to facilitate\n   cybersecurity entities
    to work together beyond national and/or\n   organizational boundaries.\n\n   Currently,
    ITU-T Draft Recommendation X.1500 defines the framework.\n   The editors designated
    for the progress of the Draft Recommendation\n   are (in alphabetical order):
    Inette Furey (DHS), Youki Kadobayashi\n   (NICT), Bob Martin (MITRE), Angela Mckay
    (Microsoft), Stephen\n   Adegbite (FIRST), Damir Rajnovic (FIRST), Gavin Reid
    (Cisco), Tony\n   Rutkowski (Yaana), Gregg Schudel (Cisco).\n\n   On behalf of
    ITU-T Q.4/17, this draft introduces the overview of\n   CYBEX in the IETF.\n\t
