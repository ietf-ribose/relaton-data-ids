abstract:
  content: "<p>The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines theproposed
    effort of the IETF OPSEC working group. This includesproducing a series of drafts
    to codify knowledge gained throughoperational experience about feature sets that
    are needed to securelydeploy and operate managed network elements providing transitservices
    at the data link and IP layers. Current plans includeseparate capabilities documents
    for Packet Filtering; Event Logging;In-Band and Out-of-Band Management; Configuration
    and ManagementInterfaces; AAA; and Documentation and Assurance. This documentdescribes
    some additional miscellaneous capabilities which do not fitinto any of these specific
    catagories, and whose descriptions arebrief enough that it does not seem appropriate
    to create a separatedocument for each.Operational Security Current Practices [12]
    lists current operatorpractices related to securing networks. This document listsmiscellaneous
    capabilities needed to support those practices.Capabilities are defined without
    reference to specific technologies.This is done to leave room for deployment of
    new technologies thatimplement the capability. Each capability cites the practices
    itsupports. Current implementations that support the capability may becited. Special
    considerations are discussed as appropriate listingoperational and resource constraints,
    limitations of currentimplementations, tradeoffs, etc.</p>"
