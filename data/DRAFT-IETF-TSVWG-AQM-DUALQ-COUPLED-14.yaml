abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture\n
    \  allows data flows over the public Internet to achieve consistent low\n   queuing
    latency, generally zero congestion loss and scaling of per-\n   flow throughput
    without the scaling problems of standard TCP Reno-\n   friendly congestion controls.
    \ To achieve this, L4S data flows have\n   to use one of the family of 'Scalable'
    congestion controls (TCP\n   Prague and Data Center TCP are examples) and a form
    of Explicit\n   Congestion Notification (ECN) with modified behaviour.  However,\n
    \  until now, Scalable congestion controls did not co-exist with\n   existing
    Reno/Cubic traffic --- Scalable controls are so aggressive\n   that 'Classic'
    (e.g. Reno-friendly) algorithms sharing an ECN-capable\n   queue would drive themselves
    to a small capacity share.  Therefore,\n   until now, L4S controls could only
    be deployed where a clean-slate\n   environment could be arranged, such as in
    private data centres (hence\n   the name DCTCP).  This specification defines `DualQ
    Coupled Active\n   Queue Management (AQM)', which enables Scalable congestion
    controls\n   that comply with the Prague L4S requirements to co-exist safely with\n
    \  Classic Internet traffic.\n\n   Analytical study and implementation testing
    of the Coupled AQM have\n   shown that Scalable and Classic flows competing under
    similar\n   conditions run at roughly the same rate.  It achieves this\n   indirectly,
    without having to inspect transport layer flow\n   identifiers.  When tested in
    a residential broadband setting, DCTCP\n   also achieves sub-millisecond average
    queuing delay and zero\n   congestion loss under a wide range of mixes of DCTCP
    and `Classic'\n   broadband Internet traffic, without compromising the performance
    of\n   the Classic traffic.  The solution has low complexity and requires no\n
    \  configuration for the public Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
