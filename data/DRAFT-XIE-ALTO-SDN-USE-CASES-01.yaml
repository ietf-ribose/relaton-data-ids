abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The introduction of SDN fundamentally changes the way that
    the ALTO\n   works.  This draft describes the Vertical Architecture and the\n
    \  Horizontal Architecture allowing coherent coexistence of application\n   layer
    traffic optimization (ALTO) with software defined network\n   (SDN).  Unique requirements
    for design and operations are identified\n   and summarized, suggesting that the
    Vertical Architecture allows\n   better division, management, flexibility, privacy
    control and long-\n   term evolution of the network.  We also define the main
    interactions\n   and information flows, and present a set of use cases to illustrate\n
    \  how we extend ALTO to support SDN, in the Vertical Architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n
