abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix
    is\nreserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the\nlike.
    \ Since site local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these\ncannot be used
    in many example situations and are confusing.\nInstead, an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/32
    is reserved in the range of\nthe test address space.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
