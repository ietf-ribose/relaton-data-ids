abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices
    and\n   networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often\n   naturally
    operate in groups (e.g.  in a building automation scenario\n   all lights in a
    given room may need to be switched on/off as a\n   group).  This document provides
    guidance for how the CoAP protocol\n   should be used in a group communication
    context.  An approach for\n   using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed for
    both constrained\n   and un-constrained networks.  Also, various use cases and\n
    \  corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important\n   concepts.
    \ Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various\n   network topologies.\n\n\t
