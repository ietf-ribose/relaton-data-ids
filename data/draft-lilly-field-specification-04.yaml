abstract:
  content: "<p>Implementation of generators and parsers of header fields requires
    certain information about those fields. Interoperability is most likely when all
    such information is explicitly provided by the technical specification of the
    fields. Lacking such explicit information, implementers may guess, and interoperability
    may suffer. This memo identifies information useful to implementers of header
    field generators and parsers. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
