abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n
    \  specification [RFC3209] and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract\n   nodes and resources
    to be explicitly included in a path setup.\n   Further Exclude Routes extensions
    [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes and\n   resources to be explicitly excluded in
    a path setup.\n\n   This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude
    domains\n   during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements\n
    \  within a common sphere of address management or path computational\n   responsibility
    (such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an\n   Autonomous System (AS)).
    \ Note that the use of AS as an abstract node\n   representing domain is already
    defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4874],\n   albeit with a 2-Byte AS number.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
