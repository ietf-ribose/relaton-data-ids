abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and tunneling
    paradigms and can be directly applied to MPLS data plane. A node steers a packet
    through a controlled set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet
    with a Segment Routing header. The segment assignment and forwarding semantic
    nature of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification
    and fault isolation in LSP with Segment Routing architecture. This document illustrates
    the problem and describe a mechanism to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment
    Routing network over MPLS data plane.</p>"
