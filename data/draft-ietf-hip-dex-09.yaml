abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange (HIP
    DEX), a variant of the Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2). The HIP DEX protocol
    design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed cryptographic primitives
    by omitting public-key signatures and hash functions. The HIP DEX protocol is
    primarily designed for computation or memory- constrained sensor/actuator devices.
    Like HIPv2, it is expected to be used together with a suitable security protocol
    such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) for the protection of upper layer
    protocol data. In addition, HIP DEX can also be used as a keying mechanism for
    security primitives at the MAC layer, e.g., for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.</p>"
