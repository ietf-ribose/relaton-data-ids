abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs that handle TCP
    that would allow many applications, such as peer-to-peer applications and on-line
    games, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements
    will greatly increase the likelihood that these applications will function properly.</p>"
