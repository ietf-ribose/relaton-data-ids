abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form
    a new\ntype of OAM packet BNM(Bidirectional Notify Message) , this BNM\npacket
    will not only have the function of informing another peer MEP\nabout existing
    fault of this path like MPLS BDI packet, but also it\nmay use for performance
    measure and testing communication between two\nequipments. in addtion, when Client
    network has a fault or defect. it\nnotify another peer client network about remote
    peer fault.  And\nthese performance measure and fault notification information
    will be\nencapsulated in BNM packet by the way of TLV packet.  So it may\ndecrease
    the number of OAM type and keep compatibility with MPLS\nnetwork. on the other
    hand, this encapsulating these information by\nthe way of TLV packet will be easy
    to extend OAM function to operate\nan MPLS Transport profile(MPLS-TP) label switched
    path (LSP).\n\t </p>\n      "
