abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new mode operation for IS-IS. In addition
    to the existing LAN and point-to-point modes of operation, a point- to-multipoint
    mode is defined. This mode is useful for operation both on networks with more
    than two routers where multicast is expensive in comparison to unicast, as well
    on networks where creating a LAN pseudonode cannot adequately reflect metrics.</p>"
