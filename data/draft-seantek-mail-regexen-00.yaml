abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Mail identifiers are used ubiquitously throughout computing
    systems as building blocks of online identity. Unfortunately, incomplete understandings
    of the syntaxes of these identifiers has led to interoperability problems and
    poor user experiences. Many users use specific characters in their addresses that
    are not properly accepted on various systems. This document prescribes normative
    regular expression (regex) patterns for all Internet- connected systems to use
    when validating or parsing Internet Mail identifiers, with special attention to
    regular expressions that work with popular languages and platforms.</p>"
