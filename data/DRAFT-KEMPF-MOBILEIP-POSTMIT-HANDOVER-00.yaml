abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile IP working group has been considering enhancements
    that \nsignificantly reduce the amount of service disruption involved in \nMobile
    IP handover. The proposals considered by the working group \nso far are based
    on having Layer 2 information available prior to \nthe handover that allows the
    Mobile Node and/or the old Foreign \nAgent to prepare for handover in some fashion.\n\t
