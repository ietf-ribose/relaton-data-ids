abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Information-Centric Networks (ICN) provide substantial flexibility\n
    \  for users to obtain information without regard to the source of the\n   information
    or its current location.  Publish/subscribe (pub/sub)\n   systems have gained
    popularity in society to provide the convenience\n   of removing the temporal
    dependency of the user having to indicate an\n   interest each time he or she
    wants to receive a particular piece of\n   related information.  Such an \"information-centric\"
    communication\n   model should be supported in the new ICN network paradigm.  This\n
    \  document outlines some research directions for ICN with respect to\n   enhancing
    the inherently pull-based ICN approaches for achieving\n   efficient pub/sub capability.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
