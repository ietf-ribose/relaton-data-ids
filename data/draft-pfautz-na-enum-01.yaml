abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document discusses a number of the administrative issues thatmust
    be resolved before effective deployment of ENUM[2,3] servicesin complex environments
    with number portability and multipleproviders for using DNS for translation of
    E.164 (telephone)numbers. North America is examined critically because itsenvironment
    may be more complex than most and because currentderegulation trends may drive
    other countries/regions in similardirections. In particular the current mechanisms
    for numberadministration and number portability in North America will requireestablishment
    of a new administrative function for managing thedomain name entries for ported
    numbers.</p>"
