abstract:
- content: "<p>Registries on the Internet and the Web fulfill a wide range of tasks,
    ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type identifiers, all
    the way to application-level protocols and standards. This document summarizes
    some of the reasons of why and how to use registries, and how some of them are
    operated. It serves as a informative reference for specification writers considering
    whether to create and manage a registry, allowing them to better understand some
    of the issues associated with certain design discussions.</p>"
