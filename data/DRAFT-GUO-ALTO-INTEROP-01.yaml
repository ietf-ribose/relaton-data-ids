abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is\n   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure
    to export such information to applications, with the\n   goal of modifying network
    resource consumption patterns while\n   maintaining or improving application performance.
    \ This document\n   provides a framework that contains data structures, configurations,\n
    \  and message templates, to test the functionality and interoperability\n   of
    an ALTO client and an ALTO server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
