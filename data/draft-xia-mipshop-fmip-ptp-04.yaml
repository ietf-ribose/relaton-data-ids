abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does notexplicitly
    define prefix management over point-to-point links when amobile node uses a prefix
    to formulate a new care-of-address. Inthis document a mechanism is developed for
    a previous access routerto request unique prefixes from a new access router, and
    in turn, theprevious access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile node
    fora new care-of-address configuration. Extensions to Mobile IPv6 FastHandovers
    specification are also specified in this document.</p>"
