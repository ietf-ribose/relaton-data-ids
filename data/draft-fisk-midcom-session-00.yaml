abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Application- and transport-layer gateways are consideredharmful
    to the Internet since they hinder the operation ofexisting and new end-to-end
    protocols. A survey of suchupper-level gateways shows that they exist because
    ofrealm-specific performance, security, and protocol needs ofcertain portions
    of the Internet. Expecting thisrealm-specific functionality to be added manually
    deployted toevery end hosts or application is, conversely, harmful to theflexibility
    of using the Internet to link disparate networks.</p>"
