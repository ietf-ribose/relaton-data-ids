abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Structured Syntax Suffixes for media types allow other media
    types to\n   build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing\n
    \  media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and\n   registers
    \"+json-seq\" as a structured syntax suffix for JSON Text\n   Sequences.\n\nNote
    to Readers\n\n   This draft should be discussed on the ietf mailing list\n   (&lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf&gt;).\n\n
    \  Online access to all versions and files is available on GitHub\n   (&lt;https://github.com/dret/I-D/tree/master/json-seq-suffix&gt;).\n\n\t
