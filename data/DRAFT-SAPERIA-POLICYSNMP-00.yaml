abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper is an introduction to terms and principles of\npolicy-based
    network configuration management that is based on\nwork in the IETF. A generic
    model for the realization of\npolicy-based network configuration management is
    presented\nbased on these terms. The last portion, and focus of the\npaper, examines
    the current work of the SNMP Configuration\nWorking Group in the IETF and maps
    that work to the previously\ndefined terms and model.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
