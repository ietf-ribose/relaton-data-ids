abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance\n
    \  while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend\n   enqueued
    at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable performance\n   degradation for TCP
    connections traversing such a bottleneck,\n   especially if there are only a few
    flows or their bandwidth-delay-\n   product is large.  An Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) signal\n   indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck,
    and\n   therefore the bottleneck network queue is likely to be short.  This\n
    \  document therefore proposes an update to RFC3168, which changes the\n   TCP
    sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to reduce the\n   Congestion
    Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the congestion\n   control algorithm's
    reaction to inferred packet loss.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
