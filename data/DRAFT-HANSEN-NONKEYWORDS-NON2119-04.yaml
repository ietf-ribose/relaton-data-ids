abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Specifications in RFCs contain normative keywords, as defined
    in RFC\n   2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions.  These\n
    \  include MUST, SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly recorded in all\n   CAPITALS
    (but need not be).  The RFC 2119 words are sometimes also\n   used with non-normative
    meaning; this non-normative usage can be\n   confusing and it is better to restrict
    the RFC 2119 words to be used\n   solely as normative directives.\n\n   Happily,
    natural languages permit variation in phrasing, so that\n   meaning can be retained
    without use of this otherwise-normative\n   vocabulary.  For such situations,
    this document provides some\n   alternatives to the normative vocabulary of RFC
    2119.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
