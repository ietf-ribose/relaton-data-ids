    that involves significant end-user interaction -- the modelis based on having
    the end-user approve the authorization that isbeing requested. That aspect makes
    the user interaction a part ofthe security model, and raises additional security
    considerationsbeyond those that are typical for client/server protocols. Thisdocument
