abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced
    in\n   the BGP protocol [RFC5575].  FlowSpec routes are used to distribute\n   traffic
    filtering rules that are used to filter Denial-of-Service\n   (DoS) attacks.  For
    the networks that only deploy an IGP (Interior\n   Gateway Protocol) (e.g., OSPF),
    it is required that the IGP is\n   extended to distribute Flow Specification or
    FlowSpec routes.\n\n   This document discusses the use cases for distributing
    flow\n   specification (FlowSpec) routes using OSPF.  Furthermore, this\n   document
    defines a OSPF FlowSpec Opaque Link State Advertisement\n   (LSA) encoding format
    that can be used to distribute FlowSpec routes,\n   its validation procedures
    for imposing the filtering information on\n   the routers, and a capability to
    indicate the support of FlowSpec\n   functionality.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
