abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN\nmailing
    list and at future bakeoffs for IUA [RFC3057].  This document \nwill be updated
    after each bakeoff augmenting the existing draft to \ninclude any new issues discovered
    during inter-operability testing. \nTwo basic sets of problems are identified
    by this draft: first, issues\nthat need to be addressed when the next revision
    of IUA is created,\ni.e.  issues that should be remembered in a BIS document;
    second,\nissues that were found that are strictly implementation problems.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
