abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that enables a Routing Protocol
    for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) router to measure the aggregated values
    of given routing metrics along an existing route towards another RPL router, thereby
    allowing the router to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a better
    route.</p>"
