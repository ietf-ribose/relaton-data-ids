abstract:
- content: "<p>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based language
    that can be used to describe service-specific execution rules for network edge
    intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework, as described
    in [3] and [4]. This memo illustrates examples of employing the IRML for Quality
    of Service (QoS) policing and control, and proposes a QoS sub-system extension
    to IRML for better QoS support in the OPES framework.</p>"
