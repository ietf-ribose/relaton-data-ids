abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, which conveys cryptographically-\n
    \  signed information about the people involved in personal\n   communications,
    to include an indication that a call has been\n   diverted from its originally
    destination to a new one.  This\n   information can greatly improve the decisions
    made by verification\n   services in call forwarding scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
