abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an\n
    \  appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point-\n   to-multipoint
    (P2MP) TE LSPs.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app]\n   presents several use cases,
    demonstrating scenarios that benefit from\n   the deployment of a stateful PCE.
    \ [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]\n   provides the fundamental PCE communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions\n   needed to support stateful PCE functions.  This memo provides\n
    \  extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful\n   PCE
    capability in supporting point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
