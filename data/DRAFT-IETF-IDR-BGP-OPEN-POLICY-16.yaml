abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate\n
    \  assumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., passing a route\n   learned
    from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit\n   provider and passing
    a route learned from one transit provider to\n   another transit provider or a
    lateral peer.  Existing approaches to\n   leak prevention rely on marking routes
    by operator configuration,\n   with no check that the configuration corresponds
    to that of the eBGP\n   neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree
    on the\n   relationship.  This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to\n   establish
    an agreement of the relationship on each eBGP session\n   between autonomous systems
    in order to enforce appropriate\n   configuration on both sides.  Propagated routes
    are then marked\n   according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention
    and\n   detection of route leaks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
