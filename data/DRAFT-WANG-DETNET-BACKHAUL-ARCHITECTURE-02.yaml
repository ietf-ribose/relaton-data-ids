abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The joint scheduling between industrial field network and backhaul\n
    \  network is important to satisfy the requirements of deterministic\n   delay
    for data flows in factories. This document describes a joint\n   scheduling architecture
    for deterministic industrial field/backhaul\n   networks. Taking WIA-PA, an international
    standard about industrial\n   wireless field network, and IPv6-based backhaul
    network as an\n   example, this document depicts how the joint scheduling architecture\n
    \  works in detail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
