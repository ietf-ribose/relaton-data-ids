abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)\n
    \  mechanism that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast\n   forwarding
    suitable for limited wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc\n   network (MANET) use.
    \ It is mainly applicable in situations where\n   efficient flooding represents
    an acceptable engineering design trade-\n   off.  It defines techniques for multicast
    duplicate packet detection\n   (DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process,
    for both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional
    mechanisms\n   for using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast
    data\n   distribution within a mesh topology as compared to classic flooding.\n
    \  Interactions with other protocols, such as use of information\n   provided
    by concurrently running unicast routing protocols, or\n   interaction with other
    multicast protocols, as well as multiple\n   deployment approaches are also described.
    \ Distributed algorithms for\n   selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion
    are provided in\n   the appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of
    multicast\n   MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in
    this\n   area, and is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
