abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft offers a proposal to form a new IAB program called the RFC
    Editor Future Development Program. This proposal is based on the discussions held
    during three virtual meetings in September and October 2019, and requests a new
    program, open to all, that will drive consensus around any changes to the RFC
    Editor model through extensive community engagement and outreach to a broad set
    of stakeholder communities.</p>"
