abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the LISP architecture and protocols
    to address the requirements of the worldwide Aeronautical Telecommunications Network
    with Internet Protocol Services, as articulated by the International Civil Aviation
    Organization. The ground-based LISP overlay provides mobility and multi-homing
    services to the IPv6 networks hosted on commercial aircrafts, to support Air Traffic
    Management communications with Air Traffic Controllers and Air Operation Controllers.
    The proposed architecture doesn't require support for LISP protocol in the airborne
    routers, and can be easily deployed over existing ground infrastructures.</p>"
