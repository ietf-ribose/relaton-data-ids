abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing\n
    \  access to protected resources.  Bearer tokens require Transport Layer\n   Security
    to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server\n   when presenting
    the access token.  The security model is based on\n   proof-of-possession: access
    token storage and transfer has to be done\n   with care to prevent leakage.\n\n
    \  There are, however, use cases that require a more active involvement\n   of
    the OAuth client for an increased level of security, particularly\n   to secure
    against token leakage.  This document specifies an OAuth\n   security framework
    using the holder-of-the-key concept, which\n   requires the OAuth client when
    presenting an OAuth access token to\n   also demonstrate knowledge of keying material
    that is bound to the\n   token.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
