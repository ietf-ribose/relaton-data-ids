abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of encapsulating
    network-layer protocol information over point-to-point links. PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of Network Control
    Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.
    This document defines the method for sending IPv6 packets over PPP links, the
    NCP for establishing and configuring the IPv6 over PPP, and the method for forming
    IPv6 link-local addresses on PPP links. It also specifies the conditions for performing
    Duplicate Address Detection on IPv6 global unicast addresses configured for PPP
    links either through stateful or stateless address autoconfiguration. This document
    obsoletes RFC 2472. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
