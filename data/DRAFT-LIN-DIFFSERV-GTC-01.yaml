abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Generic Traffic Conditioner (GTC) for\nDiffserv-capable
    nodes [RFC2475, RFC2474]. The GTC employs a token\nbucket to meter the traffic
    stream, and a shaping buffer to store\nout-of-profile packets of a behavior aggregate
    in order to enforce\nconformance to the traffic profile.  The GTC employs a policer
    to\ndecide whether to shape, drop, or re-mark the out-of-profile packets.\nThe
    GTC marks each outgoing packet with a Diffserv codepoint (DSCP)\naccording to
    the traffic conditioning result in accordance with the\nTraffic Conditioning Specification.
    By enabling the components and\nconfiguring them with associated traffic parameters,
    the GTC can be\nused to condition the traffics for EF PHB [Jacobson], AF PHBs\n[Heinanen],
    as well as Class Selector PHBs [RFC 2474].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
