abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes issues associated with providing multi-\n
    \  tenancy in large data center networks and an overlay-based network\n   virtualization
    approach to addressing them.  A key multi-tenancy\n   requirement is traffic isolation,
    so that a tenant's traffic is not\n   visible to any other tenant.  This isolation
    can be achieved by\n   assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant such
    that\n   traffic within a virtual network is isolated from traffic in other\n
    \  virtual networks.  The primary functionality required is provisioning\n   virtual
    networks, associating a virtual machine's virtual network\n   interface(s) with
    the appropriate virtual network, and maintaining\n   that association as the virtual
    machine is activated, migrated and/or\n   deactivated.  Use of an overlay-based
    approach enables scalable\n   deployment on large network infrastructures.\n\n\t
