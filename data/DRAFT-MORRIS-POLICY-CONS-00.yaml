abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Without doubt the Internet infrastructure developed far beyond
    the\nexpectations of the original funding agencies, architects,\ndevelopers, and
    early users.  The society's current use and\nexpectations often lead to the need
    to take the economical and\npolitical context in which technology is deployed
    into consideration.\n\nThis document aims to make protocol designers aware of
    the public\npolicy-related questions that may impact standards development.  This\ndocument
    contains questions, as opposed to guidelines or strict rules\nthat should in all
    cases be followed.  This document provides a\nframework for identifying and discussing
    questions of public policy\nconcern and serves as an umbrella for related policy
    documents.\n\t </p>\n      "
