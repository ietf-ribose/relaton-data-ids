abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating\n
    \  and establishing a DTLS association.  The document also defines the\n   criteria
    for when a new DTLS association must be established.  The\n   document updates
    RFC 5763 and RFC 7345, by replacing common SDP\n   offer/answer procedures with
    a reference to this specification.\n\n   This document defines a new SDP media-level
    attribute, 'tls-id'.\n\n   This document also defines how the 'tls-id' attribute
    can be used for\n   negotiating and establishing a TLS connection, in conjunction
    with\n   the procedures in RFC 4145 and RFC 8122.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
