abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Link-state routing protocols suffer from excessive flooding
    in dense\n   network topologies.  Dynamic flooding [I-D.ietf-lsr-dynamic-flooding]\n
    \  alleviates the problem by decoupling the flooding topology from the\n   physical
    topology.  Link-state protocol updates are flooded only on\n   the sparse flooding
    topology while data traffic is still forwarded on\n   the physical topology.\n\n
    \  This document describes an algorithm to obtain a sparse subgraph from\n   a
    dense graph.  The resulting subgraph has certain desirable\n   properties and
    can be used as a flooding topology in dynamic\n   flooding.\n\n   This document
    discloses the algorithm that we have developed in order\n   to make it easier
    for other developers to implement similar\n   algorithms.  We do not claim that
    our algorithm is optimal, rather it\n   is a pragmatic effort and we expect that
    further research and\n   refinement can improve the results.\n\n   We are not
    proposing that this algorithm be standardized, nor that\n   the working group
    use this as a basis for further standardization\n   work, however we have no objections
    if the working group chooses to\n   do so.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
