abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each\n   too-large
    packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or\n   perform link-specific
    fragmentation (also known as \"link adaptation\")\n   at a layer below IPv6.  This
    latter category of links is often\n   performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state
    link-specific\n   fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly\n
    \  desirable to push the workload back to the IPv6 communication\n   endpoints.
    \ A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is\n   seen for IPv6-within-IP
    tunnels.  Additionally, IPv6 nodes can avoid\n   path MTU discovery issues even
    when no link adaptation is necessary\n   by performing a small amount of fragmentation
    and/or by probing the\n   path as necessary.  This document therefore proposes
    an update to the\n   base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.\n\n\t
