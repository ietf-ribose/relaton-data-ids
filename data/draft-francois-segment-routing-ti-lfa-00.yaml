abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed at providing
    link and node protection of node and adjacency segments within the Segment Routing
    (SR) framework. This FRR behavior builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being LFAs,
    remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with directed forwarding (DLFA). It extends
    these concepts to provide guaranteed coverage in any IGP network. We accommodate
    the FRR discovery and selection approaches in order to establish protection over
    post-convergence paths from the point of local repair, dramatically reducing the
    operator's need to control the tie- breaks among various FRR options.</p>"
