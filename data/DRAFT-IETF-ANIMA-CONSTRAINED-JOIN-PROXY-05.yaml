abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge
    to a\n   domain, represented by a Registrar, using an intermediary node\n   between
    Pledge and Registrar.  This intermediary node is known as a\n   \"constrained
    Join Proxy\".\n\n   This document extends the work of [RFC8995] by replacing the
    Circuit-\n   proxy between Pledge and Registrar by a stateless/stateful\n   constrained
    (CoAP) Join Proxy.  It relays join traffic from the\n   Pledge to the Registrar.\n\n\t
