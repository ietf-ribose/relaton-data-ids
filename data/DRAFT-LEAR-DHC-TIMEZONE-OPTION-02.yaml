  content: "\n\t <p>DHCP defines an option for a server to deliver to a client offset\nfrom
    UTC.  This information in and of itself is not sufficient for\ndevices to portray
    local time both accurately and consistently.  This\nmemo specifies a new option
    for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to do so.\n\t </p>\n      "
