abstract:
- content: "<p>This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of real-time traffic.
    This traffic class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior. This
    traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure
    involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission. This differs
    from a real-time traffic class that conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop
    Behavior but is not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse capacity
    admission. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
