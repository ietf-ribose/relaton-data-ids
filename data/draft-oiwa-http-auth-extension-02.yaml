abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication framework
    for interactive clients. Recently, fundamental features of HTTP-level authentication
    is not enough for complex requirements of various Web-based applications. This
    makes these applications to implement their own authentication frameworks using
    HTML Forms and other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing
    secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user- agent clients.
    The extended framework fills gaps between Web application requirements and HTTP
    authentication provisions to solve the above problems, while maintaining compatibility
    against existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.</p>"
