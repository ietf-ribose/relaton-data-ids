abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The deployment of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) telephony is increasing
    fast.\nVoIP's paradigm and the features it offers differ significantly from\nthat
    of regular telephony, and, as a result, its monitoring\nrequirements do so as
    well.  This draft employs use cases to derive\nthese requirements and introduces
    SIPFIX, an extension to IPFIX (IP\nFlow Information eXchange), that meets them.\n\t
