abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a method by which a device or application
    may\nsignal information relating to current threat handling to other\ndevices/applications
    that may reside locally or in the cloud.  The\ninitial focus is ddos mitigation;
    however, the method may be extended\nto communicate any threat type.  This will
    allow for a vendor or\nprovider agnostic approach to threat mitigation utilising
    multiple\nlayers of protection as the operator sees fit.\n\nThe dissemination
    of threat information will occur utilising JSON RPC\nAPI over HTTPS communications
    between devices/applications and will be\naugmented by IPFIX and UDP for signaling
    telemetry information\nrelating to attacks and protected object data.\n\nAn open
    standards based approach to communication between on-premise\nDDoS mitigation
    devices and cloud based DDoS protection services\nallows for enterprises to have
    a wider range of options to better\nsecure their environments without the limitations
    of vendor lock-in.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
