    (IGAP), a protocol developed by NTT, Nortel Networks andPanasonic. IGAP provides
    IGMP's group membership control betweenhosts and their first-hop routers, with
    the addition of userauthentication and accounting. IGAP is designed to be used
    in acontrolled or managed IPv4 multicast environment, when authenticationand accounting
    are required. The user authentication information inIGAP can enable a provider
    to control the distribution of themulticast traffic as well as to collect real

    arenot shared.</p>"
