abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience with the \"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\n
    \  (6to4)\" IPv6 transition mechanism defined in RFC 3056 has shown that\n   when
    used in its anycast mode, the mechanism is unsuitable for\n   widespread deployment
    and use in the Internet.  This document\n   therefore requests that RFC 3068,
    \"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay\n   Routers\", be made obsolete and moved to
    historic status.  It also\n   obsoletes RFC 6732 \"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels\".
    \ It recommends\n   that future products should not support 6to4 anycast and that\n
    \  existing deployments should be reviewed.  This complements the\n   guidelines
    in RFC 6343.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
