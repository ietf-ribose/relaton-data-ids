abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In NAT64 scenaires,sigle-point failure is a critical issue to\nrestrict
    large-scale deployment. In order to overcome this hurdle,\nthis memo proposed
    a optimal load-balance mechanism for NAT64.\nThrough the new-defined evaluation
    metrics, several extended ICMP\nmessages combining with anycast are performed
    to achieve optimal\nNAT64 selection. Meanwihle, the synchroniztion process of
    IP address\nmapping information is also designed to guarantee the service\ncontinuity.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
