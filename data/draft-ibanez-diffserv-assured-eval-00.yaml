abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service, an end-to-endservice
    based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP. AssuredService has been
    the subject of much discussion in the past year in the IETF,but solid information
    on its applicability to the entire Internet has beenlacking. This report is aimed
    at providing a first step in this direction.Assured Service requires an active
    queue management algorithm with preferentialpacket drop. The RIO algorithm (an
    extension of the RED algorithm) has beenthe primary method suggested and is the
    one evaluated here. Our results showthat Assured Service does not provide clearly
    defined and consistent rateguarantees; the advantage gained by connections using
    Assured Service is nota quantifiable one. Further work would be required to determine
    an appropriateuse of the Assured Service. A pdf version of this document is available
    andrecommended for the figures it contains.</p>"
