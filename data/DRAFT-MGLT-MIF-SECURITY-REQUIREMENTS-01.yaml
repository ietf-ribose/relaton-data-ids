abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ISPs wants to take advantage of MIF Transport protocols like
    SCTP,\n   MPTCP to enhance their End User's experience when the End User has\n
    \  been offloaded on WLAN.  In addition, WLAN are untrusted so ISPs MUST\n   Secure
    at least some of their End Users's communications.  For\n   various reasons IPsec
    is the protocol they choose to secure the\n   communications.  Currently, IPsec
    is not adapted to Multiple\n   Interfaces Environment.  IPsec can hardly be configured
    in a proper\n   way which may result in breaking End Users' communications.  At\n
    \  least, it makes it very hard for the End Users to combine Security\n   with
    MIF enhancements.  MOBIKE partly address the problem for a\n   single Interface.
    \ This draft provides the problem statement and\n   defines the IPsec Security
    Requirements for MIF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
