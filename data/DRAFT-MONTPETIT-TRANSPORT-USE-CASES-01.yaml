abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes some of the services and application
    use\n   cases that may require specific transport services over an Internet\n
    \  subnetwork. It also presents, when available, some derived\n   requirements
    and conditions of utilization that will allow to\n   choose the most appropriate
    transport service. The use cases assume\n   that choice of transport service is
    fully based on the requirements.\n   In all cases however, the fallback is considered
    to be TCP or UDP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
