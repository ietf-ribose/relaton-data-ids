abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Service providers (ISPs) are interested in reducing the use of IPv4in
    their internal networks because of the anticipated exhaustion ofthe IPv4 address
    space. Softwires Network Address Translation (SNAT)combines IPv4 NAT and IPv4-in-IPv6
    softwires to carry IPv4 trafficthrough the ISP network that uses only IPv6 service.
    Multiplesubscribers are multiplexed through a single external global IPv4address,
    reducing the total number of IPv4 addresses in use by theISP to support Internet
    traffic to those subscribers.</p>"
