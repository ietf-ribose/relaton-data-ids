abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution\n
    \  over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant\n   Systems
    and End Devices that can be physical or virtual.\n\n   EVPN multihoming with IRB
    is one of the common deployment scenarios.\n   There are deployments which requires
    capability to have multiple\n   subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single
    bridge domain.\n\n   [RFC7432] defines three different type of service interface
    which\n   serve different requirements but none of them address the requirement\n
    \  to be able to support multiple subnets within single bridge domain.\n   In
    this draft we define new service interface type to support\n   multiple subnets
    in single bridge domain.  Service interface proposed\n   in this draft will be
    applicable to multihoming case only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
