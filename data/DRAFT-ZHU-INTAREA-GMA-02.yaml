abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n
    \  communication networks based on different technology implementations\n   and
    network architectures like WiFi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. In such\n   scenario, it is
    desirable to combine multiple access networks to\n   improve quality of experience.
    For example, an IP flow may be\n   delivered over both LTE and Wi-Fi network for
    higher end-to-end\n   throughput. In another example, lost packets may be retransmitted\n
    \  when the device switches from Wi-Fi to LTE. However, such multi-\n   access
    optimization requires inserting additional control\n   information, e.g. Sequence
    Number, into each IP packet.\n\n   Unfortunately, there is no existing IP protocol
    for such purpose. As\n   a result, IP-over-IP tunneling has been used in today's
    solutions,\n   e.g. [LWIPEP] [GRE], to insert the GRE header, and then encode\n
    \  additional control information in the GRE header fields, e.g. Key,\n   Sequence
    Number. However, there are two main drawbacks with this\n   approach: 1) IP-over-IP
    tunneling leads to higher overhead\n   especially for small packet. For example,
    the overhead of IP-over-\n   IP/GRE tunneling with both Key and Sequence Number
    is 32 Bytes,\n   which is 80% of a 40 Bytes TCP ACK packet; 2) It is difficult
    to\n   introduce new control fields using the existing GRE header format.\n\n
    \  This document presents a new light-weight and flexible encapsulation\n   protocol
    to support multi-access solutions [ATSSS] [MAMS] [LWIPEP]\n   without IP-over-IP
    tunneling.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
