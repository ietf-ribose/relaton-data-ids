abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2181 collected eight independent considerations and created
    a single\n   docuement to address each of them in turn.  Over the following two
    decades\n   it has become clear that each of these items should be considered
    and evovolve\n   in its own right, as suggested in RFC 2181. This document extracts
    the exact\n   text from RFC 2181 and places it into its own track.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
