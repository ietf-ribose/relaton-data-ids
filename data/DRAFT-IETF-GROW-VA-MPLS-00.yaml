abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The document \"FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation\"\n[I-D.francis-intra-va]
    describes how FIB size may be reduced.  The\nlatest revision of that draft refers
    generically to tunnels, and\nleaves it to other documents to define the usage
    and signaling\nmethods for specific tunnel types.  This document provides those\ndefinitions
    for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP), without tag\nstacking.\n\t </p>\n      "
