  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes architectural considerations and implications\n
    \  related to the use of a Name Resolution Service (NRS) in Information-\n   Centric
    Networking (ICN).  It explains how the ICN architecture can\n   change when an
    NRS is utilized and how its use influences the ICN\n   routing system.  This document
    is a product of the Information-\n   Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).\n\n\t
