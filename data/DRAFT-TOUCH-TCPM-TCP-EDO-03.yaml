abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP segments include a Data Offset field to indicate space
    for TCP\n   options, but the size of the field can limit the space available for\n
    \  complex options that have evolved. This document updates RFC 793\n   with an
    optional TCP extension to that space to support the use of\n   multiple large
    options such as SACK with either TCP Multipath or TCP\n   AO. It also explains
    why the initial SYN of a connection cannot be\n   extending as a single segment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
