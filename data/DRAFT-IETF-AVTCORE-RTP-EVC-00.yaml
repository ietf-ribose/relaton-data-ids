abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding\n
    \  standard ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [ISO23094-1], also\n   known
    as Essential Video Coding [EVC] and developed by ISO/IEC\n   JTC1/SC29/WG11.  The
    RTP payload format allows for packetization of\n   one or more Network Abstraction
    Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet\n   payload as well as fragmentation of a
    NAL unit into multiple RTP\n   packets.  The payload format has wide applicability
    in\n   videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate\n   entertainment-quality
    video, among other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
