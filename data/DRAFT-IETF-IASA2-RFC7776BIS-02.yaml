abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures are described in RFC 7776.\n\n
    \  The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has been replaced\n   by
    the IETF Administration LLC, and the IETF Adminstrative Director\n   has been
    replaced by the IETF LLC Executive Director.  This document\n   updates RFC 7776
    to amend these terms.\n\n   RFC 7776 contained updated to RFC 7437.  draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis\n
    \  has incorporated those updates, so this document also updates RFC\n   7776
    to remove those updates.\n\nNOTE for RFC Editor and Readers of this Document\n\n
    \  When published as an RFC\n\n   o  All references to and mentions of draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis
    in\n      this document should be replaced by the RFC that results from\n      draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis.\n\n
    \  o  The string \"XXXX\" should be replaced with the RFC number assigned\n      to
    the RFC that results from draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis.\n\n   o  This note should
    be removed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
