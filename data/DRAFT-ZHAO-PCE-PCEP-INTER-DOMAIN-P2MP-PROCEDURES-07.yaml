abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint\n(P2MP)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across\nmultiple domains has
    been identified as a key requirement for the\ndeployment of P2MP services in MPLS
    and GMPLS networks.  The Path\nComputation Element (PCE) has been recognized as
    an appropriate\ntechnology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP
    TE\nLSPs.\n\nThis document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCE\ncommunication
    Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for\nthe computation of inter-domain
    paths for P2MP TE LSPs.\n\t </p>\n      "
