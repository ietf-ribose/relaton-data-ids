abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys
    (PSKs) in Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 as defined in RFC 8446. This document
    lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions, and
    then demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks. This document
    discusses PSK use cases and provisioning processes. This document provides advice
    for applications to help meet these assumptions. This document also lists the
    privacy and security properties that are not provided by TLS 1.3 when external
    PSKs are used.</p>"
