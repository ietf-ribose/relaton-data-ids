abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which support\nthe
    classification of packets for the purposes of treating certain\nclasses or flows
    of packets in a particular way compared to other\npackets. The successful wide-scale
    deployment of these protocols\ndepends on the ability to administer and distribute
    consistent policy\ninformation to the multiple devices in the network which perform
    the \nclassification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,\nthere
    is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy\nadministration and
    distribution that will enable interoperability \namong multiple devices and device
    types that must work together to \nachieve a consistent implementation of policy.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
