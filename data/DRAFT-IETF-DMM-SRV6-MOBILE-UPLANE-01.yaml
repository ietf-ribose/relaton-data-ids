abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the applicability of SRv6 (Segment
    Routing\n   IPv6) to user-plane of mobile networks.  The source routing\n   capability
    and the network programming nature of SRv6, accomplish\n   mobile user-plane functions
    in a simple manner.  The statelessness\n   and the ability to control underlying
    layer will be even more\n   beneficial to the mobile user-plane, in terms of providing\n
    \  flexibility and SLA control for various applications.  It also\n   simplifies
    the network architecture by eliminating the necessity of\n   tunnels, such as
    GTP-U [TS.29281], PMIP [RFC5213], Mac-in-Mac, MPLS,\n   and so on.  In addition,
    Segment Routing provides an enhanced method\n   for network slicing, which is
    briefly introduced by this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
