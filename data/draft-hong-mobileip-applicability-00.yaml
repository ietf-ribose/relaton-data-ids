abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of Fast Handovers for Mobile
    IPv6 in 802.11 networks. Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 proposes a set of protocol
    enhancements to reduce handover latency due to IP protocol operations as small
    as possible by the help of L2 information. 802.11 networks are considered as a
    popular wireless infrastructure to meet broadband network service requirement
    in the future. If Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 is applied to wireless network,
    802.11 might be a practicable target for deployment. At this point some Fast Handover
    methods for Mobile IPv6 are thought to be directly applicable to 802.11 networks
    and some others are not.</p>"
