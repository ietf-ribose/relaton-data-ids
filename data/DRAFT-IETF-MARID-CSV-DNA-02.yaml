abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Increased diversity and abuse of access, across the open Internet,\n
    \  mandates additional accountability for sending SMTP clients, in the\n   absence
    of prior, direct arrangement with receiving SMTP servers.\n   One means for enabling
    this is by registration with third-party\n   services that vouch for the policies
    and accountability of SMTP\n   clients accessing SMTP servers.  This specification
    defines a means\n   for an SMTP client to list third-party services that are prepared
    to\n   vouch for it, and a means for an SMTP server, or its intermediary, to\n
    \  query vouching services.\n\t </p>\n      "
