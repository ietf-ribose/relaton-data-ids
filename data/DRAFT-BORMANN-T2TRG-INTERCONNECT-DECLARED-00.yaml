abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   \"Limited Domains\" are parts of an internet that may have
    notable\n   differences or are just convenient to separate from the general\n
    \  Internet and can be delimited from that and from other Limited\n   Domains
    by a defined boundary (the \"border\").\n\n   This memo focuses on the case where
    the nodes inside the Limited\n   Domain want to interact with nodes on (or reachable
    via) the general\n   Internet, but need some assistance at the border that is
    cognizant\n   about the specific properties of the nodes in the Limited Domain.\n\n
    \  Self-Descriptions can provide the information needed for this\n   assistance.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
