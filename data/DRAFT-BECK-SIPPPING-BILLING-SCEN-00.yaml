abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In contrast to other Internet services, most SIP sessions take\nplace
    between individuals. Today's billing schemes (flat rate or\nvolume based) do not
    reflect that. A caller causes costs on the\ncallee's side. With SIP's authentication
    methods and few additional\nheaders, a SIP billing service could be established
    that would\nenable callees to charge their callers. Call stateful proxies are\nnot
    required.\n\t </p>\n      "
