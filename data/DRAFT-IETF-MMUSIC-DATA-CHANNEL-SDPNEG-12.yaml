abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communications using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP (Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol), where each\n   data channel might be used to transport
    other protocols, called\n   subprotocols.  Data channel setup can be done using
    either the in-\n   band Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) or using some
    out-of-\n   band non-DCEP protocol.  This document specifies how the SDP (Session\n
    \  Description Protocol) offer/answer exchange can be used to achieve\n   such
    an out-of-band non-DCEP negotiation.  Even though data channels\n   are designed
    for RTCWeb use initially, they may be used by other\n   protocols like, but not
    limited to, the CLUE protocol (which is\n   defined by the IETF \"ControLling
    mUltiple streams for tElepresence\"\n   working group).  This document is intended
    to be used wherever data\n   channels are used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
