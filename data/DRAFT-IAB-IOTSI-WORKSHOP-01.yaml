abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a summary of the 'Workshop on Internet
    of\n   Things (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)' [IOTSIAG], [IOTSIWS],\n
    \  which took place in Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016.  The main\n   goal
    of the workshop was to foster a discussion on the different\n   approaches used
    by companies and standards developing organizations\n   to accomplish interoperability
    at the application layer.  This report\n   summarizes the discussions and lists
    recommendations to the standards\n   community.  The views and positions in this
    report are those of the\n   workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
    those of the\n   authors and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which organized\n
    \  the workshop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
