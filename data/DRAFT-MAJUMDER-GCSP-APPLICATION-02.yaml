abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Generic Client Server Protocol is a simple generic Application
    level\nprotocol to standardize communication between a pair of generic Client\nand
    Server. It also tries to show some way to develop a tool that will \nbuild automatically
    the generic Client/Server pair at application layer.\nHowever, the main objective
    of this memo is to standardize an \napplication layer protocol stack for Client/Server
    communication.\n\t </p>\n      "
