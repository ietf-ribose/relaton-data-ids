abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses the use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) for multi-point networks to provide nodes that participate in Protocol Independent
    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) over shared- media segment with the sub-second
    convergence of the Designated Router and defines the extension to bootstrap point-to-multipoint
    BFD session. Optional extension to PIM-SM Hello, as defined in RFC 7761, also
    defined in this document.</p>"
