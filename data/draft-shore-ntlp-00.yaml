abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The RSVP [RFC2205] model for communicating requests to networkdevices
    along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of appli-cations beyond what
    the protocol designers envisioned, and whilethe architectural model generalizes
    well the protocol itself has anumber of features that limit its applicability
    to applicationsother than IntServ [RFC1633]. The NSIS working group is developinga
    modernized version that, among other things, is based on a 'two-layer' architecture
    that divides protocol function into transportand application. This document describes
    the transport protocol.</p>"
