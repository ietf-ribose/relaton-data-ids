abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event\npackage
    for registrations. Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows a\nuser agent to create,
    modify, and delete registrations. Registrations\ncan also be altered by administrators
    in order to enforce policy.\nThese registrations therefore represent a piece of
    state in the\nnetwork that can change dynamically. There are many cases where
    a\nuser agent would like to be notified of changes in this state. This\nevent
    package defines a mechanism by which those user agents can\nrequest and obtain
    such notifications\n\t </p>\n      "
