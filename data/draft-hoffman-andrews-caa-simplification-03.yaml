abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
    allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities
    (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain. CAA Resource Records allow
    a public Certification Authority to implement additional controls to reduce the
    risk of unintended certificate mis-issue. This document defines the syntax of
    the CAA record and rules for processing CAA records by certificate issuers.</p>"
