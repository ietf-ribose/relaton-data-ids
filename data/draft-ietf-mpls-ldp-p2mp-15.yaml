abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in MPLS networks. These extensions are also
    referred to as multipoint LDP. Multipoint LDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs
    without interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction
    protocol. Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for
    building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner. There can be various applications
    for multipoint LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS
    Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs). Specification of how such applications
    can use an LDP signaled multipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document.
