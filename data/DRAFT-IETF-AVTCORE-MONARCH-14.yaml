abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTP Control
    Protocol\n   (RTCP) with a new RTCP Extended Reports (XR) (RFC3611) block type
    to\n   report new metrics regarding media transmission or reception quality,\n
    \  following RTCP guidelines established in RFC5968.  This memo suggests\n   that
    a new block should contain a single metric or a small number of\n   metrics relevant
    to a single parameter of interest or concern, rather\n   than containing a number
    of metrics which attempt to provide full\n   coverage of all those parameters
    of concern to a specific\n   application.  Applications may then \"mix and match\"
    to create a set\n   of blocks which covers their set of concerns.  Where possible,
    a\n   specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more than\n   one
    application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and\n   video.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
