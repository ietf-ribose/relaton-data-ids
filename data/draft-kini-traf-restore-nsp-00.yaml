abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Traffic recovery time when a link (or node) fails is typically in
    theorder of tens of seconds for a link state IGP. The recovery time isgoverned
    by factors like the time it takes to detect an adjacencydown, the time taken to
    propagate link state database changesthroughout the network and the time it takes
    to run the SPF algorithmand install the new routes in the FIB. Till this entire
    process iscomplete, traffic in the network can be blackholed. This draftdescribes
    a technique to reduce the time for which traffic isblackholed by routing the traffic
    through a neighbor's shortest path.</p>"
