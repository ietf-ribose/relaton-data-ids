abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The communication between LISP ETRs and Map-Servers is based
    on\n   unreliable UDP message exchange coupled with periodic message\n   transmission
    in order to maintain soft state.  The drawback of\n   periodic messaging is the
    constant load imposed on both the ETR and\n   the Map-Server.  New use cases for
    LISP have increased the amount of\n   state that needs to be communicated with
    requirements that are not\n   satisfied by the current mechanism.  This document
    introduces the use\n   of a reliable transport for ETR to Map-Server communication
    in order\n   to eliminate the periodic messaging overhead, while providing\n   reliability,
    flow-control and endpoint liveness detection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
