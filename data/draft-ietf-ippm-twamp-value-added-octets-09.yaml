abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to the Two-Way Active Measurement
    Protocol (TWAMP). Specifically, it extends the TWAMP-Test protocol, which identifies
    and manages packet trains, in order to measure capacity metrics like the available
    path capacity, tight section capacity, and UDP delivery rate in the forward and
    reverse path directions. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
