abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things concept refers to the usage of standard Internet
    protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing communication. The security
    needs are well-recognized and and many standardization steps have been taken,
    for example, specification of CoAP over DTLS. However, security challenges still
    exist and there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution. This document
    first provides an overview of security architecture, its deployment model, security
    needs in the context of the lifecycle of a thing, as well as the state of the
    art on IoT security. Then, we discuss the concept of security profiles for the
    successful roll-out of secure IoT applications and describe remaining security
    challenges in the IoT.</p>"
