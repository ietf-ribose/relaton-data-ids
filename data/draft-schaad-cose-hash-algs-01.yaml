abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]
    does not define any direct methods for using hash algorithms. There are however
    circumstances where hash algorithms are used: Indirect signatures where the hash
    of one or more contents are signed. X.509 certificate or other object identification
    by the use of a thumbprint. This document defines a set of hash algorithms that
    are identified by COSE Algorithm Identifiers.</p>"
