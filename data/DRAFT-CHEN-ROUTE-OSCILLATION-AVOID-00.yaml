abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document we propose a mechanism and routing setup that
    would\navoid persistent route oscillations and yield consistent route\nselection
    in a network using one-level Route Reflection, or using\nConfederation where routers
    that participate in inter-member-AS\npeering are fully meshed.\n\t </p>\n      "
