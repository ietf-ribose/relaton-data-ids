abstract:
- content: <p>This document reorganizes the naming of already-allocated TLV (type-
    length-value) types and type extensions in the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)
    Parameters" registries defined by RFC 5444 to use names appropriately. It has
    no consequences in terms of any protocol implementation. This document also updates
    the Expert Review guidelines in RFC 5444, so as to establish a policy for consistent
    naming of future TLV type and type extension allocations. It makes no other changes
    to RFC 5444.</p>
