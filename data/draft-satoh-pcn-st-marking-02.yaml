abstract:
  content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives early warning of congestionby
    metering and marking packets in order to protect the quality ofservice of inelastic
    flows. PCN traffic load is divide into threepre-congestion states by two rates
    that [I-D.ietf.pcn.architecture]defines per link: PCN-admissible- and PCN-supportable-rates.
    PCNadmission control and flow termination mechanisms operate inaccordance with
    these three states. [I-D.ietf.pcn.baseline.encoding]defines two PCN encoding states.
    This document proposes an algorithmfor marking and metering by using PCN baseline
    encoding for both flowadmission and flow termination. The ratio of marked packetsdetermines
    the three link states: no packets marked, some packetsmarked, and all packets
    marked. To achieve this marking behaviour,we use two token buckets. One is not
    used for marking but for amarking switch; the other is used for marking. The token
    bucket formarking has two thresholds. One is TBthreshold.threshold, alreadydefined
    in [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour], and the other is a newthreshold, which is
    set to be the number of bits of a metered-packetsmaller than the token bucket
    size. Therefore, the new threshold islarger than TBthreshold.threshold. If the
    amount of tokens is lessthan TBthreshold.threshold, all the packets are marked
    as defined in[I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour]. If the amount of tokens is lessthan
    the new threshold and greater than TBthreshold.threshold, one-Nth packets are
    marked. We evaluated the performance of admissioncontrol and flow termination
    using a simulation. For admissioncontrol, the results show that the performance
    of the algorithm wasalmost the same as, but slightly inferior to, that of CL[draft-briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb-03].
    For flow termination, theperformance of the algorithm was almost the same as CL
    when the loadwas 1.2 times the supportable rate, but it was superior to CL whenthe
    load was high (two times the supportable rate). Furthermore, inthe algorithm,
    over termination percentages of all the bottlenecklinks are almost the same in
    the case of multi-bottleneck. In CL,the over termination percentages of all the
    bottleneck links aredifferent and those at upstream bottleneck links are higher
    thanthose at downstream bottleneck links because of accumulation ofmarked packets.</p>"
