abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol
    (SCEP), a PKI protocol that leverages existing technology by using Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS, formerly known as PKCS #7) and PKCS #10 over HTTP. SCEP is
    the evolution of the enrolment protocol sponsored by Cisco Systems, which enjoys
    wide support in both client and server implementations, as well as being relied
    upon by numerous other industry standards that work with certificates.</p>"
