abstract:
- content: "<p>Some network devices get little or no entropy from their underlying
    operating systems when they are first started. As a result, cryptographic applications
    started before there is sufficient entropy in the operating system's pool can
    be initialized into a state that can be exploited by an attacker. This document
    defines a DHCP extension that can provide the operating system of a network device
    with some initial randomness that can only be known by an attacker who is on the
    same network segment as the device and its DHCP server. The operating system can
    mix this random input into its random pool early in the boot procedure and thus
    have more entropy available when cryptographic applications start.</p>"
