abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they
    share\neither a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow non\nshortest
    path links also to be used, the total network throughput goes\nup with proper
    traffic engineering.  If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in a\ntrunk, TCP flows receive
    reduced service as the UDP flows increase their\nrates.  Also, we found that in
    order to benefit from traffic\nengineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented
    end-to-end (first router\nto last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware,
    the\nbenefits are reduced or eliminated.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
