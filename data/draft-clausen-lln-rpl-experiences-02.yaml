abstract:
- content: <p>With RPL - the "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks"
    - having been published as a Proposed Standard after a ~2-year development cycle,
    this document presents an evaluation of the resulting protocol, of its applicability,
    and of its limits. The documents presents a selection of observations of the protocol
    characteristics, exposes experiences acquired when producing various prototype
    implementations of RPL, and presents results obtained from testing this protocol
    - by way of network simulations, in network testbeds and in deployments. The document
    aims at providing a better understanding of possible weaknesses and limits of
    RPL, notably the possible directions that further protocol developments should
    explore, in order to address these.</p>
