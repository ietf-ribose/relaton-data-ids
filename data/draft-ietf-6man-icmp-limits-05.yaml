abstract:
- content: "<p>Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process protocol
    headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits. When such packets
    are dropped, the sender receives no indication so it cannot take action to address
    the cause of discarded packets. This specification defines several new ICMPv6
    errors that can be sent by a node that discards packets because it is unable to
    process the protocol headers. A node that receives such an ICMPv6 error may be
    able to modify what it sends in future packets to avoid subsequent packet discards.</p>"
