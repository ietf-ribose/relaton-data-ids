abstract:
- content: "<p>The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used for the World Wide Web (Web
    PKI) is a vital component of trust in the Internet. In recent years, there have
    been a number of improvements made to this infrastructure, including improved
    certificate status checking, automation, and transparency of governance. However,
    additional improvements are necessary. This document identifies continuing areas
    of concern and provides recommendations to the Internet community for additional
    improvements, moving toward a more robust and secure Web PKI.</p>"
