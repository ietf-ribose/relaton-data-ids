abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architecture for online meetings and\n
    dating websites. The proposed architecture can use its own profiles\n database
    as well as the other internet based social networking \n database resources. The
    document proposes a modular design for \n online meeting and similar kind of applications
    on Internet. The \n architecture proposes an application specific search without
    \n breaching privacy of the registered members. It also proposes to \n utilize
    member profiles from legacy databases and websites as well as\n other implementations
    of this architecture.\n\t </p>\n      "
