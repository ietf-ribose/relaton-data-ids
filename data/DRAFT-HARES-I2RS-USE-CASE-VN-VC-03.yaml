abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize
    and\n   abstract the network in order to present virtual or abstract\n   resources
    to third-party applications running in software.\n   Applications can utilize
    a programmable interface to receive these\n   virtual or abstract resource descriptions
    in a form that allows\n   monitoring or manipulation of resources within the network.
    \ The\n   Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) provides an interface directly\n
    \  to the routing System to monitor best paths to any destination or\n   change
    routes in the routing information base (RIB) or MPLS Label\n   Information Base
    (LIB).  The I2RS interfaces may be combined with\n   other interfaces to the forwarding
    plane (ForCES (RFC3746)), device\n   configuration (NETCONF), or mid-level/peer-to-peer
    (ALTO, draft-ietf-\n   alto-protocol) system to create these virtual pathways.\n\n
    \  This document outlines how SDN networks can use the I2RS interface to\n   implement
    an automated set of network services for the Virtual\n   Connection on Demand
    (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD).\n   These systems provide service
    routing a better way to create paths\n   within a hub and spoke environment, and
    provide service routing the\n   ability to create pathways based on service.\n\n\t
