abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ''mtrace'' [1] is a very useful tool for diagnosing IP multicast
    rout-\n   ing problems, such as multicast routing loops and misconfigured mul-\n
    \  ticast routers, associated with source-rooted RPF-based distribution\n   trees.\n
    \n   For ''mtrace'' to be useful in a shared tree environment (e.g. PIM [2],\n
    \  CBT [3], GUM [4]) its behaviour must be modified. This draft speci-\n   fies
    that behaviour, which is sufficiently general to be applicable\n   to all shared
    tree types and operating modes.  A new ''wildcard'' mode\n   of behaviour is also
    described, which allows a trace of a complete\n   shared tree.  Authentication
    is recommended in this mode because of\n   its potential as a vehicle for denial
    of service attacks.\n \n   It is intended that this draft become a document of
    the Mbone Deploy-\n   ment (mboned) working group of the IETF. Therefore, comments
    are solicited and should be sent to mboned's mailing list &lt;mboned@network-\n
    \  services.uoregon.edu&gt; and/or the author.\n\t </p>\n      "
