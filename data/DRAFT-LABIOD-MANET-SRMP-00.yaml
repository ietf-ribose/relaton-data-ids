abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Source Routing-based Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is designed
    to \nprovide multicast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It applies\nthe
    source routing mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing \n(DSR) [1] in
    a modified manner decreasing the size of the packet\nheader. SRMP obtains multicast
    routes on-demand through constructing\na mesh (an arbitrary subnet) to connect
    group members providing \nrobustness against mobility.\n\t </p>\n      "
