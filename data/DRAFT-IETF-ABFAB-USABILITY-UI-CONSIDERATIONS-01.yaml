abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The real world use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that
    any\n   identity to be used to authenticate be configured on the ABFAB-\n   enabled
    client device.  Achieving this requires software on that\n   device (either built
    into the operating system or a standalone\n   utility) that will interact with
    the user, managing their identity\n   information and identity-to-service mappings.
    \ All designers of\n   software to fulfil this role will face the same set of
    challenges.\n   This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of\n
    \  producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency\n   between
    implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
