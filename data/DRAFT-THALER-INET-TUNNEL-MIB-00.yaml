abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use
    with\nnetwork management protocols in the Internet community.  In\nparticular,
    it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels\nof any type over IPv4
    and IPv6 networks.  Extension MIBs may be\ndesigned for managing protocol-specific
    objects. Likewise,\nextension MIBs may be designed for managing security-specific\nobjects.
    \ This MIB does not support tunnels over non-IP networks.\nManagement of such
    tunnels may be supported by other MIBs.\n\t </p>\n      "
