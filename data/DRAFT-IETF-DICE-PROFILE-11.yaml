abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A common design pattern in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments
    is\n   the use of a constrained device that collects data via sensor or\n   controls
    actuators for use in home automation, industrial control\n   systems, smart cities
    and other IoT deployments.\n\n   This document defines a Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) and Datagram\n   TLS (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications security
    for this\n   data exchange thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and\n
    \  message forgery.  The lack of communication security is a common\n   vulnerability
    in Internet of Things products that can easily be\n   solved by using these well-researched
    and widely deployed Internet\n   security protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
