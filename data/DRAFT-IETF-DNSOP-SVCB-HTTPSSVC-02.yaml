abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPSSVC\" DNS resource
    record\n   types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make\n   connections
    for origin resources, such as for HTTPS URLs.  SVCB\n   records allow an origin
    to be served from multiple network locations,\n   each with associated parameters
    (such as transport protocol\n   configuration and keying material for encrypting
    TLS SNI).  They also\n   enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible
    with CNAME.\n   The HTTPSSVC DNS RR is a variation of SVCB for HTTPS and HTTP\n
    \  origins.  By providing more information to the client before it\n   attempts
    to establish a connection, these records offer potential\n   benefits to both
    performance and privacy.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This proposal is inspired by and
    based on recent DNS\n   usage proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as
    well as long\n   standing desires to have SRV or a functional equivalent implemented\n
    \  for HTTP).  These proposals each provide an important function but\n   are
    potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin\n   is load-balanced
    across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN).\n   Furthermore, these each add
    potential cases for adding additional\n   record lookups in-addition to AAAA/A
    lookups.  This design attempts\n   to provide a unified framework that encompasses
    the key functionality\n   of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility
    for\n   addressing similar future challenges.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: The specific
    name for this RR type is an open topic\n   for discussion.  \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPSSVC\"
    are meant as placeholders as\n   they are easy to replace.  Other names might
    include \"B\", \"SRV2\",\n   \"SVCHTTPS\", \"HTTPS\", and \"ALTSVC\".\n\n   TO
    BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc
    [1].  The most recent\n   working version of the document, open issues, etc. should
    all be\n   available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.\n\n\t
