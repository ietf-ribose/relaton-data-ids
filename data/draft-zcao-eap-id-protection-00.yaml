abstract:
- content: "<p>The EAP framework does not provide an effective way to protect the
    peer's identity. This creates the risk of identity forgery. This document revisits
    the EAP identity protection problem, and proposes a solution to this problem via
    the use of Cryptographically Binding Identity (CBID).</p>"
