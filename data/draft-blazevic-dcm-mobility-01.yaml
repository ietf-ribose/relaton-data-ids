abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a multicast routing protocol calledDistributed
    Core Multicast (DCM). It is intended for use within alarge single Internet domain
    network with a very large number ofmulticast groups with a small number of receivers.
    Such a caseoccurs, for example, when multicast addresses are allocated to mobilehosts,
    as a mechanism to manage Internet host mobility. For suchnetworks, existing dense
    or sparse mode multicast routing algorithmsdo not scale well with the number of
    multicast groups. DCM is basedon an extension of the centre-based tree approach
    [1], [2]. It usesseveral core routers, called Distributed Core Routers (DCRs)
    and aspecial protocol between them. DCM aims: (1) to avoid multicast groupstate
    information in backbone routers, (2) to avoid triangularrouting across expensive
    backbone links, (3) to scale well with thenumber of multicast groups. We analyse
    how DCM can be used to routepackets to mobile hosts in cellular IP telephony,
    where each mobilehost is assigned a multicast address in every domain it visits.
    Thebenefits of multicasting-based approach to route packets to mobilehosts are
    low latency and no disruption during handover.</p>"
