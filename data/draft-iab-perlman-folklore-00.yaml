abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to set the tone as an IETF collaboration
    to collect various tricks and ''gotchas'' in protocol design. It is not intended
    to declare the ''right'' and ''wrong'' ways of doing things, but rather ''this
    practice has the following advantages and disadvantages'', or ''here are several
    ways of solving the following problem'', with technical explanation of the pros
    and cons of the various approaches. Discussion will take place on the mailing
    list folklore@external.cisco.com. To join, send a message to folklore- request@external.cisco.com.</p>"
