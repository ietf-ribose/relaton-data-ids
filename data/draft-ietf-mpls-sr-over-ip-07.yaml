abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) is a method of source routing a packet
    through an MPLS data plane by imposing a stack of MPLS labels on the packet to
    specify the path together with any packet-specific instructions to be executed
    on it. SR-MPLS can be leveraged to realize a source-routing mechanism across MPLS,
    IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS label stack as a source-routing instruction
    set while making no changes to SR-MPLS specifications and interworking with SR-MPLS
    implementations. This document describes how SR-MPLS-capable routers and IP-only
    routers can seamlessly coexist and interoperate through the use of SR-MPLS label
    stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-over-UDP as defined in RFC
    7510.</p>"
