abstract:
- content: "<p>The NEAT System provides an example of a system designed to implement
    the TAPS Transport Services. This document presents the transport services that
    the NEAT User API provides to an application or upper- layer protocol. It also
    describes primitives needed to interface to the NEAT Policy Manager and how policies
    can be adjusted to match the API behaviour to the properties required by an application
    or upper- layer protocol using the NEAT User API.</p>"
