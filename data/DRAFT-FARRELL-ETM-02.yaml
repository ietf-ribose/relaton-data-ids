abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We argue that an expanded threat model is needed for Internet\n
    \  protocol development as protocol endpoints can no longer be\n   considered
    to be generally trustworthy for any general definition of\n   \"trustworthy.\"\n\n
    \  This draft will be a submission to the DEDR IAB workshop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
