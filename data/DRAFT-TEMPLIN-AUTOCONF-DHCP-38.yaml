abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Enterprise networks connect routers over various link types, and
    may also connect to provider networks and/or the global Internet.  Enterprise
    network nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes
    and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including
    Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational
    corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This
    document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration
    and operation of nodes in enterprise networks.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t
