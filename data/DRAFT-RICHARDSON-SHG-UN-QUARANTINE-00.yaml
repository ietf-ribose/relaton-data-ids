abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a tool to describe
    the\n   limited access that a single function device such as an Internet of\n
    \  Things device might need.  The enforcement of the access control\n   lists
    described protects the device from attacks from the Internet,\n   and protects
    the Internets from compromised devices.\n\n   This document details the process
    which occurs when a device is\n   detected to have violated the stated policy.
    \ The goal of these steps\n   is to ensure that the device is correctly removed
    from operation,\n   fixed, and if possible, restored to safe operation.\n\n\t
