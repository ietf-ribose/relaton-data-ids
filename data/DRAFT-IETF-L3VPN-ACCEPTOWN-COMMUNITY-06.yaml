abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector
    to\n   be able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that is\n   distributed
    by the route reflector, enabling the route reflector to\n   control how a route
    originated within one VRF is imported into other\n   VRFs.  This technique works
    effectively as long as the VRF that\n   exports the route is not on the same PE
    as the VRF(s) that import the\n   route.  However, due to the constraints of the
    BGP protocol, it does\n   not work if the two are on the same PE.  This document
    describes a\n   modification to the BGP protocol allowing this technique to work
    when\n   the VRFs are on the same PE, allowing the technique to be used in a\n
    \  standard manner throughout an autonomous system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
