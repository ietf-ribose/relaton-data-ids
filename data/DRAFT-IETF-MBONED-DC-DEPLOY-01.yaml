abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive
    amounts of\n   hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use
    of\n   IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how\n
    \  IP Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to\n   understand
    the surrounding issues with doing so.  This document\n   provides a quick survey
    of uses of multicast in the data center and\n   should serve as an aid to further
    discussion of issues related to\n   large amounts of multicast in the data center.\n\n\t
