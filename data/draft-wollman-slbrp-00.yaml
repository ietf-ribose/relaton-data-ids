abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an experimental protocol called the Server Load
    Balancing Registration Protocol (SLBRP). This protocol permits servers to register
    and coordinate services with a service load balancing (SLB) application. Coordination
    between real servers and the SLB application will include service definition(s),
    Virtual IP (VIP) address support, server application health monitoring, as well
    as, optional support for automatic Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS- based Global
    Server Load Balancer (GSLB) updates. This document also describes Anycast Address
    Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementations that can operate with an SLB and GSLB
    based enterprise infrastructure.</p>"
