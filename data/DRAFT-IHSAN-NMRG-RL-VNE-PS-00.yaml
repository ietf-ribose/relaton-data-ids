abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network
    Embedding\n   (VNE) is a problem to map a virtual network to the substrate network.\n
    \  It has a great impact on the performance of virtual network and\n   resource
    utilization of the substrate network.  An efficient\n   embedding strategy can
    maximize the acceptance ratio of virtual\n   networks to increase the revenue
    for Internet service provider.\n   Several works have been appeared on the design
    of VNE solutions,\n   however, it has becomes a challenging issues for researchers.
    \ To\n   solved the VNE problem, reinforcement learning (RL) can play a vital\n
    \  role to make the VNE problem more intelligent and efficient.\n   Moreover,
    RL has been merged with deep learning techniques to develop\n   adaptive models
    with effective strategies for various complex\n   problems.  In RL, agents can
    learn desired behaviors (e.g, optimal\n   VNE strategies), and after learning
    and completing training, it can\n   embed the virtual network to the subtract
    network very quickly and\n   efficiently.  RL can reduce the complexity of the
    VNE method,\n   however, it is too difficult to apply RL techniques directly to
    VNE\n   problems and need more research study.  In this document, we are\n   presenting
    a problem statement to motivate the research community to\n   solve the VNE problem
    using reinforcement learning.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
