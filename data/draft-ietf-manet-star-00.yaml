abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Source-Tree Adaptive Routing (STAR) protocol is intended for
    useby nodes (static and mobile) in an ad hoc network or an internet. Arouter in
    STAR communicates to its neighbors the parameters of itssource routing tree, which
    consists of each link that the routerneeds to reach every known destination (and
    address range) in the adhoc network or internet. To conserve transmission bandwidth
    andenergy, a router communicates changes to its source routing tree onlywhen the
    router detects new destinations, the possibility of looping,or the possibility
    of node failures or network partitions.</p>"
