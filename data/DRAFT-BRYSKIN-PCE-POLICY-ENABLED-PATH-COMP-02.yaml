abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PCE architecture [PCE-ARCH] introduces the concept of policy
    in\n   the context of path computation. This document provides additional\n   details
    on policy within the PCE Architecture and also provides\n   context for the support
    of PCE Policy. This document introduces the\n   use of the Policy Core Information
    Model (PCIM) as a framework for\n   supporting path computation policy. This document
    also provides\n   representative scenarios for the support of PCE Policy.\n\t
