abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications\n
    \  environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of\n   these
    environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,\n   compliance, and consumer
    protection reasons.  Recording of a session\n   is typically performed by sending
    a copy of a media stream to a\n   recording device.  This document lists call
    flows that has snapshot\n   of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format
    for which is\n   described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] .  This is purely an\n
    \  informational document that is written to support the model defined\n   in
    the metadata draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
