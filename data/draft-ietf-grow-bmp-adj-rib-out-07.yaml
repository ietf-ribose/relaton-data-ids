abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) only defines access to the Adj-RIB-In
    Routing Information Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by adding
    access to the Adj-RIB-Out RIBs. It also adds a new flag to the peer header to
    distinguish between Adj-RIB-In and Adj-RIB-Out.</p>"
