abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism that a DOTS client can
    use to\n   signal that a network is under a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)\n
    \  attack to an upstream DOTS server so that appropriate mitigation\n   actions
    are undertaken (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or\n   add to watch list)
    on the suspect traffic.  The document specifies\n   both DOTS signal and data
    channels.  Happy Eyeballs considerations\n   for the DOTS signal channel are also
    elaborated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
