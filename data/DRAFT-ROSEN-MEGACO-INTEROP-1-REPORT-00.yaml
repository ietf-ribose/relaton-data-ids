abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An interoperability test of the Megaco (RFC2885/6) protocol was
    held \non August 28-31 in Durham, NH.  An excellent turnout of many \ndifferent
    independently developed implementations were present, and \na great many of the
    tests were quite successful, including media \nflow in many cases, and several
    cases of testing a Media Gateway \ncontroller from one organization with two Media
    Gateways from \ndifferent organizations.   \nThe primary purpose of the event
    was to assess the ability of \nindependent development teams to create interoperable
    devices from \nthe recent Proposed Standard RFCs 2885 [1] and 2886 [2].  While
    \nseveral discrepancies were found that resulted from differing \ninterpretations
    of the documents, the level of compatibility \nexhibited at this first test was
    excellent.  A secondary purpose of \nthe event was to begin the process of moving
    the RFCs to draft \nstandard status, which requires documentation of at least
    two \nimplementations of each protocol element/feature.  While this first \nevent
    only used a subset of the protocol, quite a few of the \nelements and features
    were demonstrated by all implementations. \n  \n   This I-D describes the event
    and summarized the results.   \n\n\t </p>\n      "
