abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a Lower than Best-Effort (LBE) per-hopbehavior
    (PHB) for use within and between DifferentiatedServices domains [3]. The primary
    objective of this LBE PHBis to separate LBE traffic from best-effort traffic incongestion
    situations, i.e., when resources become scarce.Furthermore, LBE traffic gets a
    minimal share of bandwidth sothat it will not be fully preempted by best-effort
    traffic.This is achieved by discarding LBE packets more aggressivelythan best-effort
    packets while trying to enqueue them in caseof congestion.There are numerous uses
    for this PHB, e.g., for transmissionof background traffic such as bulk data transfers
    of minorimportance, backup data traffic during working hours ortraffic caused
    by web search engines while gatheringinformation from web servers. Thus, it constitutes
    thenetwork equivalent to a background priority for processes inan operating system.
    Moreover, it is particularly useful incases when packets of a better service are
    re-marked by a nodefor subsequently receiving a forwarding treatment that isequivalent
    to the best-effort service. In this situation theLBE PHB helps to protect other
    best-effort packets fromexperiencing unfair forwarding treatment because it avoidstheir
    preemption by re-marked packets. For instance, thiscase occurs when heterogeneous
    multicast groups should besupported.</p>"
