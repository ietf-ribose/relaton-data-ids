abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of a Network Policy System is to manage and control
    a\n   network as a whole.  To achieve this purpose, network operators need\n   to
    control the behavior of the individual entities that comprise the\n   network,
    and this control needs to be harmonized across multiple\n   entities.  For example,
    to control the access to a network, the\n   operator must control the behavior
    at all of network elements at the\n   edge of the network, and must apply consistent
    policies at those\n   elements.\n\n   Network Services are provided by network
    operators to their customers\n   using the resources of the network.  To effectively
    control a\n   network, the operator must have knowledge of network services\n
    \  supported by the network, as well as knowledge of the network\n   resource
    utilization and the capabilities of each network entity.\n   Control of the network
    to deliver the network services will involve\n   applying policy at individual
    network entities and across the whole\n   network, as well as controlling and
    allocating the resources within\n   the network.\n\n   This document describes
    a common framework and common core YANG data\n   model for network policies.  The
    framework can be applied to deliver\n   various different network services by
    controlling the policies that\n   enable features such as Constraint-based Routing,
    Network QoS,\n   Traffic engineering, network management, etc.  In future, the
    core\n   data model could be augmented by additional YANG data modules\n   modeling
    and configuring policy-related protocols and functions.  The\n   policy data model
    described in this document provides common building\n   blocks for such extensions.\n\n\t
