abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant is designed for Internet-
    connected devices that either lack a browser to perform a user-agent- based authorization
    or are input constrained to the extent that requiring the user to input text in
    order to authenticate during the authorization flow is impractical. It enables
    OAuth clients on such devices (like smart TVs, media consoles, digital picture
    frames, and printers) to obtain user authorization to access protected resources
    by using a user agent on a separate device.</p>"
