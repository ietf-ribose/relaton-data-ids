abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 4474 defines a mechanism for secure identification of callers
    in\nthe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This mechanism has been used\nas the
    foundation for some recent additional work, including\nconnected party identification,
    anti-spam, and secure media.\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the applicability
    of RFC\n4474 in real deployments and the actual level of security services it\nprovides.
    \ This document describes those concerns.\n\t </p>\n      "
