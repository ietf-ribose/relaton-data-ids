abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet
    for\n   presenting HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor\n
    \  must meet certain requirements.  This draft describes those\n   requirements
    and is based on the classes defined in draft-hildebrand-\n   html-rfc.\n\n   Discussion
    of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list\n   (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org),
    which has its home page at\n   https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.\n\n\t
