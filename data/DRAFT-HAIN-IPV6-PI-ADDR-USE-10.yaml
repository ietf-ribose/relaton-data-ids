abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the expected use of the Provider Independent
    \naddress format discussed in the companion document GEO [1] in the \nInternet.
    Several parties have expressed interest in using this \napproach as a good fit
    for managing their networks. With the long \ntimeframe that the shim6 effort will
    take, this approach provides a \nscalable multi-homing approach for use in the
    interim. In addition \nto covering implementations where it adds value in managing
    the \ngrowth of the Internet routing tables, the document will discuss \nimplementations
    that should be avoided due to the negative impact on \nthe routing tables.  \n\n\t
