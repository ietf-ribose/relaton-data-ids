abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such
    as\npieces of information or server processes, which are available in\nseveral
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\nis not limited to,
    peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\nof Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\nguidance to applications, which have to select
    one or several hosts\nfrom a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired\nresource.
    \ This memo proposes one possible way of implementing the\nALTO protocol, called
    H1H2.  The H1H2 protocol is a client/server\nprotocols between end hosts and ALTO
    servers that allows two\ndifferent ways of exchanging data between the server
    and the client.\n\t </p>\n      "
