abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is proposed to use version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange
    (IKEv2) to replace current HIP protocol's base exchange. IKE-H is an extension
    of IKE used for performing mutual authentication, establishing and maintaining
    security associations. It provides continuity of communications between not only
    hosts but also security gateways. It supports HIP identity authentication method
    and the establishment of keying material, consequently being used by IPsec Encapsulated
    Security payload (ESP) to establish a two- way secure communication channel between
    the hosts or security gateways.</p>"
