abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current [MP-BGP] extensions carry routing information by\n
    \  associating the same network layer protocol with both the NLRI and\n   the
    next hop. However, in certain scenarios, it is desirable or\n   required to advertise
    next hop information associated with a\n   different network layer protocol to
    the one associated with the NLRI.\n\n   Similarly, when data traffic for a network
    layer protocol's NLRIs\n   needs to be forwarded over an underlying tunnel, it
    is required to\n   indicate the tunnel endpoint to be used for forwarding with
    the BGP\n   update for a given NLRI.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP attribute,
    called the SW_NEXT_HOP\n   attribute, which can optionally be used in a BGP Update
    message to\n   advertise next hop information associated with a different network\n
    \  layer protocol than that of the NLRIs or convey information about the\n   tunnel
    endpoint.\n\t </p>\n      "
