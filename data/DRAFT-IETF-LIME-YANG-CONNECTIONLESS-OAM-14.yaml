abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless\n
    \  Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  The data\n   model
    is defined using the YANG in RFC7950 data modeling language.\n   It provides a
    technology-independent abstraction of key OAM\n   constructs for connectionless
    protocols.  The base model presented\n   here can be extended to include technology
    specific details.  This is\n   leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and
    support both nested\n   OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different
    or same\n   levels through a unified interface) and interacting OAM workflows\n
    \  (i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified\n   interface).\n\n\t
