abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP.  How to transport
    application messages on these\n   data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they
    can be carried as SCTP\n   user messages), however it is yet to be decided how
    to establish and\n   manage these data channels.  This document specifies a method
    for\n   this, which relies first on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band\n   negotiation
    of data channel configurations (within the SDP offer/\n   answer exchange) and
    second on the signaling of the configuration in\n   use in the SCTP user message
    itself.  Once these configurations are\n   negotiated, further creations of data
    channels can occur purely in-\n   band by simply sending user messages, which
    avoids to define a new\n   in-band data channel protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
