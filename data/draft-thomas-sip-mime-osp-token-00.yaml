abstract:
  content: "<p>The Open Settlement Protocol (OSP)[1], an open standard from theEuropean
    Telecommunications Standards Institute, specifies a meansby which IP telephony
    equipment in one administrative domain mayrequest access to IP telephony equipment
    (including, but not limitedto: Gateways, Proxy Servers, Gatekeepers, etc.) in
    anotheradministrative domain. OSP grants such access by returningauthorization
    tokens, which must then be passed to the destinationIP telephony device during
    call signaling. In order to supportaccess control via OSP, IP telephony signaling
    protocols must becapable of carrying these authorization tokens in an interoperableway.
    This memo defines just such a method for protocols, such as theSession Initiation
    Protocol[2], that can support carriage of MIMEtypes during call signaling. This
    memo conforms to the requirementsfor MIME type registration defined in RFC 2048[3].</p>"
