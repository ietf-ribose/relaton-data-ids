abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Raw binary data is often encoded using a mechanism that enables
    the\n   data to be included in human-readable text-based formats.  This\n   mechanism
    is often referred to as \"base-encoding the data\".  Base-\n   encoding is often
    used when expressing binary data in hyperlinks,\n   cryptographic keys in web
    pages, or security tokens in application\n   software.  There are a variety of
    base-encodings, such as base32,\n   base58, and base64.  It is not always possible
    to differentiate one\n   base-encoding from another.  The purpose of this specification
    is to\n   provide a mechanism to be able to deterministically identify the\n   base-encoding
    for a particular string of data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
