abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handover\ndelay
    due to authentication when a peer moves from one point of\nattachment to another.
    \ Work has progressed on two different\napproaches to reduce handover delay: early
    authentication (so that\nauthentication does not need to be performed during handover),
    and\nreuse of cryptographic material generated during an initial\nauthentication
    to save time during re-authentication.  A starting\nassumption is that the mobile
    host or \"peer\" is initially\nauthenticated using the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP),\nexecuted between the peer and an EAP server as defined in RFC
    3748.\n\nThis document documents the HOKEY architecture.  Specifically, it\ndescribes
    design objectives, the functional environment within which\nhandover keying operates,
    the functions to be performed by the HOKEY\narchitecture itself, and the assignment
    of those functions to\narchitectural components.  It goes on to illustrate the
    operation of\nthe architecture within various deployment scenarios that are\ndescribed
    more fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY Working\nGroup.\n\t </p>\n
