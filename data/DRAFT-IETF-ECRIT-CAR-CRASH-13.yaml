abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n
    \  mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by
    vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually
    invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location
    data related to the crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as
    \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n   (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\"
    (AACN), even in the\n   case of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers
    to the\n   ability to carry a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers
    a MIME Content Type and Emergency Call\n   Additional Data Block for the vehicle,
    sensor, and location data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though
    there is not\n   necessarily a crash).  An external specification for the data
    format,\n   contents, and structure are referenced in this document.\n\n   This
    document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan-\n   European eCall
    (a mandated and standardized system for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems
    within Europe and other regions).\n   However, this document specifies a different
    set of vehicle (crash)\n   data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set
    (VEDS) rather than\n   the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is
    an extension\n   of the eCall document, with the primary differences being that
    this\n   document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and adds\n
    \  attribute values to the eCall metadata/control object to permit\n   greater
    functionality.  This document registers a new INFO package\n   (identical to that
    registered for eCall but with the addition of the\n   VEDS MIME type).  This document
    also describes legacy (circuit-\n   switched) ACN systems and their migration
    to next-generation\n   emergency calling, to provide background information and
    context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
