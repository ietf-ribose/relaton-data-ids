abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile
    service\n   providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly\n
    \  available in 3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well.\n   Such
    functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple\n   Packet Data
    Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility between\n   Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.\n\n
    \  The EAP-AKA (and EAP-AKA') protocol is required for mobile devices to\n   access
    the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks.  This\n   document defines
    a few new EAP attributes to enable the above-\n   mentioned functions in such
    networks.  The attributes are exchanged\n   between a client (such as a Mobile
    Node) and its network counterpart\n   (such as a AAA server) in the service provider's
    infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
