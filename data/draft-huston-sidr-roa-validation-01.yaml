abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an application of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    to validate the origination of routes advertised in the Border Gateway Protocol.
    The proposed application is intended to fit within the requirements for adding
    security to inter-domain routing, including the ability to support incremental
    and piecemeal deployment, and does not require any changes to the specification
    of BGP.</p>"
