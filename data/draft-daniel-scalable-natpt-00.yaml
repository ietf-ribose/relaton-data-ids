abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides scalability extension to NAT-PT. The extension
    is based on the use of DNS-ALG and exchange of load metrics amongst a cluster
    of NAT-PT devices. We refer such a NAT-PT device as mNAT-PT. mNAT-PT is valuable
    in connecting large V6 domains to legacy V4 domain.</p>"
