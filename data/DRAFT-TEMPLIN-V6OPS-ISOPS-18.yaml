abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly\n
    \  IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small\n   home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but\n   share the commonality
    that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal\n   routing and addressing services for
    most applications.  As more and\n   more IPv6-only services are deployed, however,
    end user devices\n   within such sites will increasingly require at least basic
    IPv6\n   functionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance\n
    \  for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the\n   Intra-Site
    Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
