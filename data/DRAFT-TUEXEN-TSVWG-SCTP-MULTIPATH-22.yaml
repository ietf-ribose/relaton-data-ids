abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) supports multi-homing\n
    \  for providing network fault tolerance.  However, mainly one path is\n   used
    for data transmission.  Only timer-based retransmissions are\n   carried over
    other paths as well.\n\n   This document describes how multiple paths can be used
    simultaneously\n   for transmitting user messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
