abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public
    end-\n   entity (for example, web servers) and intermediate TLS certificate\n
    \  issued by a known Certificate Authority recorded in one or more\n   certificate
    logs.  In order to detect misissuance of certificates,\n   all logs are publicly
    auditable.  In particular, domain owners or\n   their agents will be able to monitor
    logs for certificates issued on\n   their own domain.\n\n   To protect clients
    from unlogged misissued certificates, each log\n   signs all certificates it records,
    and clients can choose not to\n   trust certificates that are not accompanied
    by an appropriate log\n   signature.  For privacy and performance reasons log
    signatures are\n   embedded in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization extension,
    in\n   a stapled OCSP extension, or in the certificate itself via an X.509v3\n
    \  certificate extension.\n\n   To ensure a globally consistent view of any particular
    log, each log\n   also provides a global signature over the entire log.  Any\n
    \  inconsistency of logs can be detected through cross-checks on the\n   global
    signature.  Consistency between any pair of global signatures,\n   corresponding
    to snapshots of a particular log at different times,\n   can be efficiently shown.\n\n
    \  Logs are only expected to certify that they have seen a certificate,\n   and
    thus we do not specify any revocation mechanism for log\n   signatures in this
    document.  Logs are append-only, and log\n   signatures do not expire.\n\n\n\t
