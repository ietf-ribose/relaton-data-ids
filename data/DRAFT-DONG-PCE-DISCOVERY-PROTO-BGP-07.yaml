abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In networks where a Path Computation Element (PCE) is used
    for path\n   computation, it is desirable for the Path Computation Clients (PCCs)\n
    \  to discover dynamically and automatically a set of PCEs along with\n   certain
    information relevant for PCE selection.  RFC 5088 and RFC\n   5089 define the
    PCE discovery mechanisms based on Interior Gateway\n   Protocols (IGP).  This
    document defines extensions to BGP for the\n   advertisement of PCE Discovery
    information.  The BGP based PCE\n   discovery mechanism is complementary to the
    existing IGP based\n   mechanisms.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
