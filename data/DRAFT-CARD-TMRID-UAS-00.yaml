abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an Applicability Statement for various IETF\n
    \  Technical Specifications, including the Host Identity Protocol\n   (HIPv2)
    and the Domain Name System (DNS), complementing emerging\n   external standards
    for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) remote\n   identification (RID).  The objectives
    are: to facilitate use of\n   existing Internet services to support UAS RID and
    to enable enhanced\n   RID related services; and to enable verification that UAS
    RID\n   information is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the absence of\n   Internet
    connectivity at the receiving node).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
