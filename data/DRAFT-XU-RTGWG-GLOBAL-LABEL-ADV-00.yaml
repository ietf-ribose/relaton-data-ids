abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which
    each\n   SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS\n
    \  labels for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT].\n   One
    major challenge associated with such label advertisement\n   mechanism is how
    to avoid a given global MPLS label from being\n   allocated by different routers
    to different prefixes. Although manual\n   allocation can address such label allocation
    collision problem, it is\n   error-prone and therefore may not be suitable for
    large SR network\n   environments. This document proposes an alternative approach
    for\n   advertising global labels without any risk of label allocation\n   collision.\n\n\t
