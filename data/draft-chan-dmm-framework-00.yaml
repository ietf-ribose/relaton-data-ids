abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a framework for mobility management protocols
    in terms of their key abstracted logical functions. The framework is capable of
    presenting a unified view, reducing the clutter that obscures a casual reader
    from understanding the commonalities between different approaches in mobility
    management. A first order application of this framework allows us to examine previously
    standardized mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well
    as several of their extensions), and describe their core functionality in terms
    of different configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.</p>"
