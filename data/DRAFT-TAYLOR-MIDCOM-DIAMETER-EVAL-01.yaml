abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is submitted as part of the Midcom protocol selection
    \nprocess.  It evaluates the suitability of the Diameter protocol as a \ntransport
    for Midcom.  The general conclusions are:  \n.  the Diameter architecture may
    be too heavy for the Midcom \napplication, although this is a matter for discussion.
    \ It is \nclear in any event that much of the Diameter base is not \nneeded; \n.
    \ a new application extension to Diameter would have to be \ndefined to meet Midcom's
    requirements; \n.  with these reservations, the protocol is a good fit to Midcom
    \nrequirements. \nThis version contains added details describing how to use Diameter
    \nto meet the requirements. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
