abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
    Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.
    The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization
    steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of
    the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS). However, security challenges still exist, not only because there
    are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices
    and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities.
    In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing.
    Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one
    might face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss the next steps
    needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be
    used by implementers and authors of IoT specifications as a reference for details
    about security considerations while documenting their specific security challenges,
    threat models, and mitigations. This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing
    Research Group (T2TRG).</p>"
