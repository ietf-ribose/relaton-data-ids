abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to extend Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    Version 2 (IKEv2) so that the shared secret exchanged between peers has resistance
    against quantum computer attacks. The basic idea is to exchange one or more post-quantum
    key exchange payloads in conjunction with the existing (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman
    payload.</p>"
