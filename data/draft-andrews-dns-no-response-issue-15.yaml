abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond or to respond
    correctly to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term
    problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of common
    classes of queries that some servers fail to respond too or respond incorrectly
    to. This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators
    to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem. The document does not look at
    the DNS data itself, just the structure of the responses.</p>"
