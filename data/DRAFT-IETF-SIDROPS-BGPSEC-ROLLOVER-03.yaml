abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Certification Authorities (CAs) within the Resource Public
    Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI) manage BGPsec router certificates as well as\n   RPKI
    certificates.  The rollover of BGPsec router certificates must\n   be carefully
    performed in order to synchronize the distribution of\n   router public keys with
    BGPsec Update messages verified with those\n   router public keys.  This document
    describes a safe rollover process,\n   as well as discussing when and why the
    rollover of BGPsec router\n   certificates are necessary.  When this rollover
    process is followed\n   the rollover will be performed without routing information
    being\n   lost.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
