abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible
    to\n   host various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment.\n
    \  The virtual machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a\n   virtual
    machine from one hypervisor to another.  However, such a\n   technology is mainly
    focusing on a migration between hypervisors\n   attached to the same link, and
    tend not to consider migration over\n   the Internet.  This document mentions
    the purpose of that type of\n   operation and describe several possible operation
    methods to provide\n   network portability in cloud systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
