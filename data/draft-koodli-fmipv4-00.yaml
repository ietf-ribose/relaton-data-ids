abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IPv6 fast handover document [2] specifies a protocol to
    improve latency and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv6 handover operations.
    This document adapts the protocol for IPv4 networks to improve performance over
    Mobile IPv4 operations, including processing of Agent Advertisements, new Care
    of Address acquisition and Registration Request and Reply. However, Foreign Agent
    operation at a router is not necessary. Also, the protocol may be used transparently
    on hosts which do not support Mobile IP, but with limited movement across subnets.
    Using the concepts outlined in [2], this document also addresses movement detection,
    IP address configuration and location update latencies. For reducing the IP address
    configuration, the draft provides two alternatives. First, the new CoA is always
    made to be the new access router's IP address. Second, a hash algorithm is used
    to produce a new CoA, and any conflicts are resolved so as not to cause traffic
    misdirection.</p>"
