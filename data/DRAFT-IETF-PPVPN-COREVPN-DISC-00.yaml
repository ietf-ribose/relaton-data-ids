abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An IPVPN consists of many routers, some  physically  discrete
    \ and\nsome  virtual,  housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem that\npresents
    itself is that these virtual routers need  to  find  each\nother  over  a  virtual
    \ topology  and they need to send broadcast\ndatagrams as mandated in routing
    protocols [such as  the  neighbor\ndiscovery  datagram  and  routing  updates
    \ in  OSPF,  the routing\nupdates in RIPV2 etc] and user data over  this  virtual
    \ topology.\nThis memo presents an approach for solving these problems.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
