abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Flow Specification (flowspec) Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (BGP NLRI) extension ([RFC5575]) is used to distribute\n   traffic
    flow specifications into BGP.  The primary application of\n   this extension is
    the distribution of traffic filtering policies for\n   the mitigation of distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n   By default, flow specification filters
    are applied on all forwarding\n   interfaces that are enabled for use by the BGP
    flowspec extension.  A\n   network operator may wish to apply a given filter selectively
    to a\n   subset of interfaces based on an internal classification scheme.\n   Examples
    of this include \"all customer interfaces\", \"all peer\n   interfaces\", \"all
    transit interfaces\", etc.\n\n   This document defines BGP Extended Communities
    ([RFC4360]) that\n   permit such filters to be selectively applied to sets of
    forwarding\n   interfaces sharing a common group identifier.  The BGP Extended\n
    \  Communities carrying this group identifier are referred to as the BGP\n   Flowspec
    \"interface-set\" Extended Communities.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
