abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the concept of the SRLG-based logical
    ring \n   configuration and recovery method using the ring-SRLG for the purpose
    of \n   restoration in mesh networks. In this restoration architecture, backup
    \n   paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path, which \n   follows
    the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment \n   of backup
    path disjointed from the working path. We also propose the \n   GMPLS signaling
    extension for the end-to-end restoration based on the \n   SRLG-based logical
    ring configuration.  \n\t </p>\n      "
