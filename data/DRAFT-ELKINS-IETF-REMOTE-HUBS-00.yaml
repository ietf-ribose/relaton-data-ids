abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite
    a few\n   regions.  There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are\n
    \  organized.  Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India.\n   The
    two regions are different in how they arose, where they meet, and\n   what they
    do.\n\n   Thus, creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs\n
    \  may be very different across cultures and of very different sizes.\n\n   Lastly,
    this document discusses how IETF \"central\" can assist with\n   remote hubs.\n\n\t
