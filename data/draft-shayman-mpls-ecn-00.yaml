abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose the addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) together
    with congestion signaling back to the ingress in order to provide notification
    to the ingress label switching router (LSR) if congestion is experienced along
    a label switched path (LSP). This information could be used by the ingress LSR
    to mitigate congestion by employing dynamic traffic engineering techniques such
    as shifting flows to alternate paths.</p>"
