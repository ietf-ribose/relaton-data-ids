abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to SIP for subscriptions and notifications
    of user presence. User presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a
    user to communicate with other users on the network. Historically, presence has
    been limited to 'on-line' and 'off-line' indicators; the notion of presence here
    is broader.</p>"
