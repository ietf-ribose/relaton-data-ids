abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Like many network protocols, HTTP is vulnerable to ossification
    of\n   its extensibility points.  This draft explains why HTTP ossification\n
    \  is a problem and establishes guidelines for exercising those\n   extensions
    by 'greasing' the protocol to combat it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
