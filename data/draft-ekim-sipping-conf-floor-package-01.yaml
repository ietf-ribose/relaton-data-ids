abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a conference floor event package for Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) conferences that require floor control. The conference
    floor event package allows users to subscribe to a conference floor server URIs.
    Notifications are sent about changes in the floor state of the conference and
    optionally about changes in the state of additional floor components of the conference.
    Subscriptions and notifications of conference floor are supported by an event
    package within the general SIP event notification framework.</p>"
