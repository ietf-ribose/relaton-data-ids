abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The end-to-end network one-way delay is an important performance\n
    \  metric in the 5G network.  For realizing the accurate one-way delay\n   measurement,
    existing methods requires the end-to-end deployment of\n   accurate clock synchronization
    mechanism, such as PTP or GPS, which\n   results in relatively high deployment
    cost.  Another method can\n   derive the one-way delay from the round-trip delay.
    \ In this case,\n   since the delay of the downlink and uplink of the 5G network
    may be\n   asymmetric, the measurement accuracy is relatively low.  Hence, this\n
    \  document introduces a method to measure the end-to-end network one-\n   way
    delay based on a reference delay guaranteed by deterministic\n   networking without
    clock synchronization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
