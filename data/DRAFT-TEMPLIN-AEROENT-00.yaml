abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enterprise networks provide a secured data communications\n
    \  infrastructure built for the purpose of information sharing and\n   increased
    productivity for end users within the organization.\n   Enterprise networks are
    often organized as private Internets unto\n   themselves that connect to the global
    Internet either not at all or\n   via firewalls, proxies, and/or other network
    securing devices.  This\n   document discusses an AERO enterprise network profile
    that outlines\n   new and more flexible methods for connecting, tracking and managing\n
    \  mobile organizational assets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
