abstract:
  content: "<p>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow.
    Reliable auditing is necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx
    information honestly. This document defines how the signals are handled by an
    audit and lists requirements for an audit implementation. This document does not
    mandate a particular design but identifies state and functions that any auditor
    element must provide to fulfill the requirements stated in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech].</p>"
