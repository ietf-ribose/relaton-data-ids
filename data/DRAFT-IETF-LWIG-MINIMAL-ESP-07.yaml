abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a minimal IP Encapsulation Security
    Payload\n   (ESP) defined in RFC 4303.  Its purpose is to enable implementation\n
    \  of ESP with a minimal set of options to remain compatible with ESP as\n   described
    in RFC 4303.  A minimal version of ESP is not intended to\n   become a replacement
    of the RFC 4303 ESP.  Instead, a minimal\n   implementation is expected to be
    optimized for constrained\n   environment while remaining interoperable with implementations
    of RFC\n   4303 ESP.  In addition, this document also provides some\n   considerations
    to implement minimal ESP in a constrained environment\n   which includes limiting
    the number of flash writes, handling frequent\n   wakeup / sleep states, limiting
    wakeup time, or reducing the use of\n   random generation.\n\n   This document
    does not update or modify RFC 4303, but provides a\n   compact description of
    how to implement the minimal version of the\n   protocol.  RFC 4303 remains the
    authoritative description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
