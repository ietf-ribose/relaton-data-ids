abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines two textual conventions similar to theRowPointer
    textual convention defined in RFC2579. These two textualconventions indicate how
    the conceptual row to which an object pointsis to be handled when the object is
    cloned to create an instance-specific configuration. This cloning may involve
    the scripting-basedtechniques defined under the SMNP Configuration umbrella, but
    it neednot: cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Setoperations.</p>"
