abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The current SDP Capability Negotiation solution includes
    the ability \n        for a potential configuration to delete and replace individual
    \n        attributes from the actual configuration. This capability introduces
    \n        some complexity into the SDP Capability Negotiation framework and \n
    \       this document examines the need for having this feature and proposes \n
    \       a way forward.  \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
