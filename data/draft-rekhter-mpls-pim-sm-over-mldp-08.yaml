abstract:
- content: "<p>When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in Any Source Multicast (ASM)
    mode need to pass through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees
    to Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how to accomplish
    this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths are established
    using mLDP.</p>"
