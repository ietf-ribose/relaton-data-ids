abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes
    a relationship between two devices by agreeing on a secret and manually verifying
    the secret's authenticity using an SAS (short authentication string). Pairing
    has to be performed only once per pair of devices, as for a re-discovery at any
    later point in time, the exchanged secret can be used for mutual authentication.
    The proposed pairing method is suited for each application area where human operated
    devices need to establish a relation that allows configurationless and privacy
    preserving re-discovery at any later point in time. Since privacy preserving applications
    are the main suitors, we especially care about privacy.</p>"
