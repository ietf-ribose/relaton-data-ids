abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol\n   (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store\n
    \  information about users and other network entities.  One such use is\n   to
    store information on groups.  There are LDAP standards established\n   for this
    purpose, e.g. the groupOfUniqueNames [3].  However,\n   currently there are no
    standards for a very important use of Groups,\n   as SMTP Mailing Lists or Aliases.\n\n
    \  This document discusses how we at Netscape have made this extension,\n   with
    the intent of providing useful information towards perhaps\n   creating standards
    for this important use of LDAP.\n\t </p>\n      "
