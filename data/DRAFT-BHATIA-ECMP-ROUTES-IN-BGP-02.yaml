abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an extensible mechanism that will allow
    a BGP  \n[BGP4] speaker to advertise ECMP routes for a destination to its \npeers.
    It uses an existing, Multi Hop Capability [M-HOP], to \nadvertise multiple paths
    that it is using to its peers. \nThe mechanism described in this document is only
    applicable to \nrouters that have the ability to inject multiple routing entries
    in \ntheir forwarding table. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
