abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The existing PKI has a few inherent limitations like:\n \n  1.
    It is implicitly assumed that the two trading parties have ONE\n  mutually trusted
    third party that can attest ALL of each\n  party's attributes. It provides no
    mechanism to separate out the\n  fields in a certificate for attestation by different
    Certification\n  Authorities.\n \n  2. This standard in no way gives the flexibility
    to expose only\n  certain fields of a certificate to the other party.\n\nThis
    memo proposes a model which, while working well within the\nX.509v3 framework,
    overcomes these limitations by\nbreaking up a certificate into pre-signed 'unit
    attestations'\nreferred to as 'Atomic Certificates' and packaging them in the\nX.509v3
    format only at the time of sending the certificate to the\nother party.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
