abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC can
    be run\n   over CoAP and used by two peers to establish an OSCORE Security\n   Context.
    \ This document further profiles this use of the EDHOC\n   protocol, by specifying
    a number of additional and optional\n   mechanisms.  These especially include
    an optimization approach for\n   combining the execution of EDHOC with the first
    subsequent OSCORE\n   transaction.  This combination reduces the number of round
    trips\n   required to set up an OSCORE Security Context and to complete an\n   OSCORE
    transaction using that Security Context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
