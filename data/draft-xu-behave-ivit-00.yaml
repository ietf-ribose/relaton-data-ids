abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism, IVIT (IVI+Tunnel), to supportnon-IVI
    IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 hosts, and vice versa.IVIT combines IVI translation
    and Tunnel methods with the IVItranslation at the core and the tunnel at the edge.
    In thisdocument, IVIT provides two modes. One is the dual-stack host mode,which
    supports the communication between a dual-stack host in an IPv4network and a non-IVI
    IPv6 host, especially the communicationscenario between a dual-stack server in
    an IPv4 network and a non-IVIIPv6 host. The other is the CPE mode, which supports
    thecommunication between an IPv4-only host and a non-IVI IPv6 host,especially
    the bidirectional communication scenario between a privateIPv4 network and a non-IVI
    IPv6 network. Combined with IVI, IVIT cansupport the communication between IPv4
    networks and IPv6 networksstatelessly at the core.</p>"
