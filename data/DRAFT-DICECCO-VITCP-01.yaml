abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Virtual Interface (VI) architecture [VIAR] describes a high\nperformance
    design for interfacing distributed applications to \naccelerated protocol processing.
    \ VI seeks to improve the performance \nof such applications by reducing the latency
    and overheads associated \nwith standard communications protocol stack processing.
    \ VI greatly \nreduces the processing overhead associated with traditional network
    \narchitectures by providing applications a protected, directly \naccessible interface
    to network hardware - a Virtual Interface.\n\nThis memo describes extensions to
    the VI Architecture designed to \nfacilitate operation over TCP/IP.  These extensions
    take the form of \nenhancements to the VI Provider Library API defined in the
    VI \nArchitecture Developer's Guide [VIDG], and a 'VI Protocol' which \nsupports
    VI functionality during operation over TCP/IP.\n\nThe extensions to the VI Architecture
    which support operation over\nTCP/IP are intended to be fully compliant with the
    VI Architecture\n[VIAR] and its associated Developer's Guide [VIDG].\n\t </p>\n
