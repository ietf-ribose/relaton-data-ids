abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OAM (Operations, Administration and Management) processes for
    data\n   networks are often subject to the problem of circular dependencies\n
    \  when relying on network connectivity of the network to be managed for\n   the
    OAM operations itself.  Provisioning during device/network bring\n   up tends
    to be far less easy to automate than service provisioning\n   later on, changes
    in core network functions impacting reachability\n   can not be automated either
    because of ongoing connectivity\n   requirements for the OAM equipment itself,
    and widely used OAM\n   protocols are not secure enough to be carried across the
    network\n   without security concerns.\n\n   This document describes how to integrate
    OAM processes with the\n   autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic Networks
    (AN). to provide\n   stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes.\n\n\t
