abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a problem with the current Proposed Standard for
    HTTP/1.1 found as a result of implementation experience. A web server may be implemented
    in an embedded system as a network user interface. Often the embedded system is
    one which has no other use for a real-time clock, and/or the web interface is
    being added to an existing device which has no clock. Without a clock, no accurate
    HTTP Date header can be generated. This memo examines the implications of this
    situation for the operation of HTTP/1.1 origin servers, proxies, and clients,
    and proposes changes to the HTTP/1.1 specification to permit compliant operation
    in such systems.</p>"
