abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture\n
    \  allows data flows over the public Internet to predictably achieve\n   ultra-low
    queuing latency, generally zero congestion loss and scaling\n   of per-flow throughput
    without the problems of traditional TCP.  To\n   achieve this, L4S data flows
    have to use one of the family of\n   'Scalable' congestion controls (Data Centre
    TCP and TCP Prague are\n   examples) and a form of Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) with\n   modified behaviour.  However, until now, Scalable congestion controls\n
    \  did not co-exist with existing TCP Reno/Cubic traffic --- Scalable\n   controls
    are so aggressive that 'Classic' TCP algorithms drive\n   themselves to a small
    capacity share.  Therefore, until now, L4S\n   controls could only be deployed
    where a clean-slate environment could\n   be arranged, such as in private data
    centres (hence the name DCTCP).\n   This specification defines `DualQ Coupled
    Active Queue Management\n   (AQM)', which enables these Scalable congestion controls
    to safely\n   co-exist with Classic Internet traffic.\n\n   The Coupled AQM ensures
    that competing Scalable and Classic flows run\n   at about the same rate.  It
    achieves this indirectly, without having\n   to inspect transport layer flow identifiers,
    When tested in a\n   residential broadband setting, DCTCP also achieves sub-millisecond\n
    \  average queuing delay and zero congestion loss under a wide range of\n   mixes
    of DCTCP and `Classic' broadband Internet traffic, without\n   compromising the
    performance of the Classic traffic.  The solution\n   also reduces network complexity
    and requires no configuration for the\n   public Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
