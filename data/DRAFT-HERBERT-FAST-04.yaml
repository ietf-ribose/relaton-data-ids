abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets protocol.
    A\n   ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a granted\n   right
    to traverse a network or a request for network services to be\n   applied. Applications
    request tickets from a local agent in the\n   network and attach issued tickets
    to packets. Firewall tickets are\n   issued to grant packets the right to traverse
    a network; service\n   tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to a
    packets. A\n   single ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket\n   information.
    Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
