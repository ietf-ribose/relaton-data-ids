abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP has shown how a reliable transport protocol can efficiently
    use multiple paths for a given connection. We leverage the experience gained with
    Multipath TCP to propose simple extensions that enable QUIC to efficiently use
    multiple paths during the lifetime of a QUIC connection.</p>"
