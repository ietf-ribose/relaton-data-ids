abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      This document specifies how to carry colored path advertisement
    via\nan enhancement       to the existing protocol BGP Label Unicast. It would
    allow\nbackward compatibility       with RFC8277.\n\n      The targeted solution
    is to use stack of labels advertised via BGP\nLabel Unicast       2.0 for end
    to end traffic steering across multiple IGP domains. The\noperation is       similar
    to Segment Routing.\n\n      This proposed protocol will convey the necessary
    reachability information\nto the       ingress PE node to construct an end to
    end path.\n\n      Another two problems addressed here are the interworking with
    Flex-Algo,\nand the       MPLS label space limit problem.\n\n      Please note
    that there is a major change of protocol format starting\nfrom version       01
    draft. Except the optional BGP capability code, these rest of\nBGP attributes
    \      used in this draft are defined in previous RFC or in use today in\nother
    scenario. \n\t </p>\n      "
