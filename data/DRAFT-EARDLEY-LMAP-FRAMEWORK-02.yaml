abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation\n
    \  of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols\n   that
    coordinate interactions between the components.  The document\n   presents an
    overall framework for large-scale measurements and\n   discusses which elements
    could be standardised in the IETF.  It is\n   intended to assist the discussions
    about the potential creation of\n   the LMAP working group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
