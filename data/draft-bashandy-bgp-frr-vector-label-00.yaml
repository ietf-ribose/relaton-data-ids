abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,CE2,...,
    CEm. If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totallydisconnected from the core,
    it is desirable for a core router \"P\"carrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restoretraffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi anddestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers thatadvertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it ishighly desirable to keep
    the core BGP-free while not imposingrestrictions on external connectivity or complicating
    provisioningeffort. Thus (1) a core router should not be required to learn anyBGP
    prefix, (2) the size of the forwarding and routing tables in thecore routers should
    be independent of the number of BGP prefixes, (3)re-routing traffic without waiting
    for re-convergence must not causeloops, (4) provisioning effort should be kept
    at minimum, and (5)there should be no restrictions on what edge routers advertise
    whatprefixes. For labeled prefixes, (6) the label stack on the packetmust allow
    the repair PEj to correctly forward the packet and (7)there must not be any need
    to perform more than one label lookup onany edge or core router during steady
    state</p>"
