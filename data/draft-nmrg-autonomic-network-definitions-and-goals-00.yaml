abstract:
- content: "<p>Autonomic systems were first described in 2001. The fundamental goal
    is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing
    and self-protection. This document applies the concepts of autonomic systems to
    a network, and describes the definitions and design goals of Autonomic Networking.
    The goal is a network where nodes have minimal dependencies on human administrators
    or centralized management systems.</p>"
