abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a stateless traffic engineering (TE) multicast
    along an explicit P2MP Path/Tree using an IPv6 extension header called TE multicast
    routing header (MRH). The MRH with the path encoded in link numbers is added into
    a packet to be multicast at the ingress. The packet is delivered to the egresses
    along the path. There is no state stored in the core of the network.</p>"
