abstract:
  content: "<p>With the growing requirements for reliable Internet connectivity,increasing
    number of enterprises choose to acquire Internetconnectivity from more than one
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) forthe purpose of connectivity redundancy and
    traffic load distribution.The potential of large number of multi-connection sites
    impose directchallenge on routing aggregation and consequently on scalability
    ofthe global Internet routing. Hence a solution is highly desirablewhich provides
    the benefit of multi-connection as well as the betterscalability of the global
    routing system. In addition, such solutionneeds to be simple enough to be operationally
    manageable. With thefast growth of ISP networks as well as enterprise networks,
    networkmanageability is becoming an increasingly important requirement. Thisdocument
    describes a solution which achieves the stated goals.</p>"
