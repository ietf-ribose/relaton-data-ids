abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft is an individual submission that proposes
    an\n   update to the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for\n
    \  ESP and AH; it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of\n   these
    algorithms.\n\n   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication
    Header\n   (AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to\n   provide
    confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to\n   protected data communications
    in the IP Security (IPsec)\n   architecture.  To ensure interoperability between
    disparate\n   implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-\n
    \  implement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of\n   mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies\n   algorithms that should be implemented
    because they may be promoted to\n   mandatory at some future time, and also recommends
    against the\n   implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is
    also\n   provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security\n
    \  goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n
