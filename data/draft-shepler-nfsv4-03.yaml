abstract:
- content: "<p>NFS version 4 is a distributed file system protocol which owes heritage
    to NFS versions 2 [RFC1094] and 3 [RFC1813]. Unlike earlier versions, NFS version
    4 supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking
    and the mount protocol. In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation),
    compound operations, and internationlization have been added. Of course, attention
    has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.</p>"
