abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the \"Bump-In-the-API\" (BIA) host based\nprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supporting\nonly one IP address
    family to communicate with peers that are\nreachable or supporting only the other
    address family.\n\nThis specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided
    dual\nstack or IPv6 only network connectivity.  In the dual stack network\ncase,
    single address family applications in the host sometime will\ncommunicate directly
    with other hosts using the different address\nfamily.  In the case of IPv6 only
    network or IPv6 only destination,\nIPv4-originated communications have to be translated
    into IPv6.\nTechnically, the BIA-enabled host resolves both A and AAAA addresses\nof
    the destination and behaves according to received responses.\n\nAcknowledgement
    of previous work\n\nThis document is an update to and directly derivative from
    Seungyun\nLee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's\n[RFC3338],
    which similarly provides a dual stack host means to\ncommunicate with other IPv6
    host using existing IPv4 appliations.The\noriginal document was a product of the
    NGTRANS working group.\n\nThe changes in this document reflect four components\n\n\n1.
    \ Supporting IPv6 only network connections\n\n\n2.  IPv4 address pool use private
    address\n\n\n3.  Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently\n\n\n4.
    \ Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR\n\nThe goal of this mechanism
    is the same as that of the Bump-in-the-\nstack mechanism, but this mechanism provides
    the translation method\nbetween the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs.  Thus, the goal is
    simply\nachieved without IP header translation.\n\t </p>\n      "
