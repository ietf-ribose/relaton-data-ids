abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universally Unique Identifier is a suitable standard for, as the
    name suggests, uniquely identifying entities in a symbol space large enough that
    the identifiers do not collide. The literal representation, however, specified
    in RFC 4122 and elsewhere, cannot be used in conjunction with a number of formal
    grammars where it would be beneficial to do so. This document provides the UUID
    with two additional representations to make these applications possible.</p>"
