abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is commonly assumed that a system controller or network
    management\n   system has complete knowledge of the data plane, especially in
    a\n   software-defined network (SDN).  That is, the controller knows\n   performance
    metrics such as the flow table size of each switch, the\n   rate of rule updates
    between a switch control plane and its data\n   plane, and the maximum latency
    to install a rule in the flow table of\n   a switch.  However, in reality, this
    is not the case.  Measurement\n   studies show that the flow table size depends
    on the structure of the\n   rules installed.  The flow table size is much smaller
    if there are\n   many wild card rules.  The setup latency also depends on the
    already\n   installed rules.  If there are many wild card rules installed, the\n
    \  latency can be much higher.  Currently, data centers pre-setup the\n   rules
    long before the actual associated traffic starts to flow\n   through the network.
    \ This puts constraints on the use cases.  In\n   this document, we first show
    that many use cases demand a more\n   predictable control plane.  The use cases
    are applied to networks\n   that require control-plane performance information
    for dynamic\n   configuration, as well as SDN networks.  We then discuss potential\n
    \  mechanisms to enable fine-grained control of control-plane\n   performance.\n\n\n\t
