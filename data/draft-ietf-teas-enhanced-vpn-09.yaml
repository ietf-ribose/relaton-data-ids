abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private
    Network (VPN+) services. The purpose of enhanced VPNs is to support the needs
    of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services,
    by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and Traffic Engineering
    (TE) technologies and adds characteristics that specific services require over
    those provided by traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will be used to underpin network
    slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity
    services between customer sites. It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered
    using a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This
    document provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas
    for potential new work.</p>"
