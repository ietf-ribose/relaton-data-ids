abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently working on
    an\n   architecture for controlling media services.  As part of the\n   MediaCtrl
    architecture the Media Resource Broker (MRB) was identified   as the component
    needed for intelligent, application level media\n   service selection based on
    non-static signaling properties.  This\n   document defines the mechanisms needed
    by the media servers to\n   publish their capabilities and the mechanisms needed
    by the MRB to\n   monitor the status of the media servers.\n\t </p>\n      "
