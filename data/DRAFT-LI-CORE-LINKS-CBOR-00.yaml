abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between
    Web\n   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes\n
    \  of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links\n   can
    be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).\n\n   This specification defines
    a common format for representing Web links\n   in CBOR format (RFC7049).\n\nNote\n\n
    \  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should\n   be
    sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
