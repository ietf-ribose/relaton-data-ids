abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga
    was\n   originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently\n
    \  from a low-Earth-orbiting satellite constellation, but is useful in\n   many
    other scenarios, including ad-hoc peer-to-peer communications,\n   large-scale
    scientific sensing, and grid computing.  Saratoga is a\n   simple, lightweight,
    content dissemination protocol that builds on\n   UDP, and optionally uses UDP-Lite.
    \ Saratoga is intended for use when\n   moving files or streaming data between
    peers which may have\n   permanent, sporadic or intermittent connectivity, and
    is capable of\n   transferring very large amounts of data reliably under adverse\n
    \  conditions.  The Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly\n   asymmetric
    link or path capacity between peers, and can support\n   fully-unidirectional
    data transfer if required.  Saratoga can also\n   cope with very large files for
    exascale computing.  In scenarios with\n   dedicated links, Saratoga focuses on
    high link utilization to make\n   the most of limited connectivity times, while
    standard congestion\n   control mechanisms can be implemented for operation over
    shared\n   links.  Loss recovery is implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ\n
    \  mechanism.  The protocol specified in this document is considered to\n   be
    appropriate for experimental use on private IP networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
