abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and
    access\ncontrol for IP multicasting.  The scope of the requirements is\nlimited
    to cases where Authentication, Accounting and Authorization\n(AAA) functions are
    coordinated between Content Provider(s) and\nNetwork Service Provider(s).\n\nIn
    order to describe the new requirements of a multi-entity Content\nDeliver System(CDS)
    using multicast, the memo presents three basic\nbusiness models: 1) the Content
    Provider and the Network Provider are\nthe same entity, 2) the Content Provider(s)
    and the Network\nProvider(s) are separate entities and users are not directly
    billed,\nand 3) the Content Provider(s) and the Network Provider(s) are\nseparate
    entities and users are billed based on content consumption\nor subscriptions.
    \ The requirements of these three models are listed\nand evaluated as to which
    aspects are already supported by existing\ntechnologies and which aspects are
    not.\n\nGeneral requirements for accounting and admission control\ncapabilities
    including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues are\nlisted and the constituent
    logical functional components are\npresented.\n\nThis memo assumes that the capabilities
    can be realized by\nintegrating AAA functionalities with a multicast CDS system,
    with\nIGMP/MLD at the edge of the network.\n\t </p>\n      "
