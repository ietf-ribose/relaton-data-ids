  content: "\n\t <p>The third generation, 3G, wireless networks that enable high-speed\ndata
    transfer are now being introduced.  Internet access is one of\nthe most important
    applications of such networks.  TCP is one of the\nkey technologies that enable
    Internet applications for such networks.\nA number of TCP optimization techniques
    have been studied to enhance\nthe performance of TCP transmission for various
    wireless\nenvironments.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
