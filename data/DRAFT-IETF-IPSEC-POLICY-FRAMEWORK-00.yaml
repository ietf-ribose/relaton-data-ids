abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As policy based networking has become a common place across
    the\n   Internet with the advent of IPsec, firewalls and other initiatives,\n
    \  it is important for peering end nodes to understand where and why\n   packets
    enroute are black-holed. End-to-end networking mandates that\n   end nodes be
    cognizant of the impact policies along various points\n   on the network will
    have on their packets. The objective of this\n   document is to lay out a framework
    of policy requirements for end\n   nodes.  While the framework is focussed on
    IPSec based policies,\n   it may be applicable across a wider policy base.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
