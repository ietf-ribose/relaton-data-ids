abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This informational draft presents results of a study on usingdifferent
    drop precedence assignments to address fairness issues whenUDP and TCP traffic
    share the same Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB class.In particular, six different
    possible combinations of drop precedenceassignment were explored with two different
    models of RED parametersettings. We present results showing that the type of RED
    modelutilized can play a role in the nature of bandwidth sharing betweenTCP and
    UDP flows. The results also show that with the current fourClass, three Drop Precedence
    AF specification, complete fairnessbetween TCP and UDP cannot be completely achieved
    using separate dropprecedence assignment. This is true for both under-provisionednetworks
    and over-provisioned networks. Certain drop precedencemapping schemes are beneficial
    to TCP while others are beneficial forUDP.</p>"
