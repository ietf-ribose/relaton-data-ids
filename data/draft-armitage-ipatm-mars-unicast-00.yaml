abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the relationship between unicast and multicast
    service support in the IP over ATM environment, and explores some implications
    of noting that unicasting can be considered as a subset of multicasting. Specifically
    it is shown how the Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) in draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt
    might be used to provide IP unicast address resolution service, acting as a substitute
    for an RFC1577 ARP Server. It is also noted that an RFC1577 ARP Server can be
    built as a 'front end' to a MARS. This memo is intended as a companion to the
    ideas contained in draft-smith-ipatm-bcast-00.txt, which noted how IP broadcast
    could be supported by the MARS as a special case of multicast.</p>"
