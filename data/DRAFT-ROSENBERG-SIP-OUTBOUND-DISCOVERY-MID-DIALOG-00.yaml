abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many deployment configurations, Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)\n   clients are capable of initiating connection requests towards their\n
    \  SIP server, but the SIP server cannot open connections towards the\n   client.
    \ Specifications have been developed which allow for a client-\n   initiated connection
    to be used for incoming requests towards the\n   client.  This outbound connection
    involves the use of a SIP proxy,\n   called an outbound proxy, that the client
    connects to.  However, the\n   specification does not provide a means to discover
    the outbound\n   proxy, nor does it support high availability for failures of
    the\n   outbound proxy mid-dialog.  This specification fills those gaps.  The\n
    \  resulting mechanism additionally provides solutions for inter-proxy\n   connection
    reuse and usage of certificates with SIP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
