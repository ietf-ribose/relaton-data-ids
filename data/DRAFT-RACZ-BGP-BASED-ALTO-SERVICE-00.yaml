abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Overlay applications, like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing and
    video\nstreaming, attract a lot of users and generate a huge amount of data.\nMost
    overlay applications do not take into account the underlying\nnetwork topology
    in their routing decisions and connection\nestablishment in general. Due to this
    fact and the large amount of\nP2P traffic, overlay applications waste network
    resources, cause\nproblems in network management, and result in high costs for
    ISPs,\nespecially because of the expensive interconnection links between\nISPs.
    Therefore, the objective of the ALTO Working Group Charter\n[ALTO-charter] is
    to design and specify an Application-Layer Traffic\nOptimization (ALTO) service
    that will assist P2P applications in\ntheir peer selection process in order to
    achieve a more efficient\nusage of network resources, to reduce operational costs
    of ISPs, and\nto increase the overlay application performance at the same time.\n\nThis
    draft proposes a possible ALTO service that uses BGP routing\ninformation in order
    to calculate a rating value for peers providing\na certain resource (resource
    providers). The service is operated by\nthe ISP. Since BGP routing information
    is available in any ISP\nnetwork and the service accesses the routing information
    from the\nlocal ISP network, the deployment of the service does not require\nchanges
    in the network and the ALTO server can retrieve routing\ninformation automatically.\n\t
