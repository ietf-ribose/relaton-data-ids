abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-EnabledLocation
    Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the serverresponsible for that resource.
    This ensures that requests generatedby user agents that are unaware of the special
    status of a URI do notresult in unhelpful responses and enables the use of HTTP
    GET forlocation configuration and dereference.</p>"
