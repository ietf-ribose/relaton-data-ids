abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between
    the \n   randomly constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical \n
    \  network topology, causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT \n   time.
    This document describes how DHT overlay peers can interact with \n   the routers
    by traceroute to get the path information, and execute 2-\n   Means Classification,
    thereafter peers leverage the DHT itself to    build efficient \"closer\" cluster.
    This scheme only requires the \n   infrastructure to enable traceroute queries.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
