abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order to provide interoperable implementations of certain Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) based features, such as automated call\nhandling, it is necessary
    for devices to configure network servers\nwith feature data.  An example is a
    call forwarding number for a call\nforwarding service.  This document introduces
    the concept of\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST) and gives an example of
    how\nREST can be used for such configuration.\n\t </p>\n      "
