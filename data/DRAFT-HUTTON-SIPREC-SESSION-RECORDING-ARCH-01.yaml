abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications\nenvironments
    such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of\nthese environments, all
    calls must be recorded for regulatory,\ncompliance, and consumer protection reasons.
    \ Recording of a session\nis typically performed by sending a copy of a media
    stream to a\nrecording device.  This document describes architectures for\ndeploying
    session recording solutions in an environment which is\nbased on the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP).\n\t </p>\n      "
