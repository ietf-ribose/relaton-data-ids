abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is investigating
    mobile routing solutions for a worldwide Aeronautical Telecommunications Network
    with Internet Protocol Services (ATN/IPS). The ATN/IPS will eventually replace
    existing communication services with an IPv6-based service supporting pervasive
    Air Traffic Management (ATM) for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC), Airline Operations
    Controllers (AOC), and all commercial aircraft worldwide. This informational document
    describes a simple mobile routing service based on mature industry standards to
    address the ATN/IPS requirements.</p>"
