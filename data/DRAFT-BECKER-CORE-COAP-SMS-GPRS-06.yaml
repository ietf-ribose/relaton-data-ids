abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is
    frequently\n   used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for\n
    \  telematic devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and high\n   delays
    just as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs),\n   i.e. 6LoWPANs.
    \ The design of the Constrained Application Protocol\n   (CoAP, RFC7252), that
    took the limitations of LLNs into account, is\n   thus also applicable to other
    transports.  The adaptation of CoAP to\n   SMS transport mechanisms is described
    in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
