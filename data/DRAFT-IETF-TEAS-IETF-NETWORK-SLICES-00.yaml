abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   &lt;FAb&gt;\n\n   This memo discusses setting up special-purpose
    network connections\n   using existing IETF technologies.  These connections are
    called IETF\n   network slices for the purposes of this memo.  The memo discusses
    the\n   general framework for this setup, the necessary system components and\n
    \  interfaces, and how abstract requests can be mapped to more specific\n   technologies.
    \ The memo also discusses related considerations with\n   monitoring and security.\n\n
    \  This memo is intended for discussing interfaces and technologies.  It\n   is
    not intended to be a new set of concrete interfaces or\n   technologies.  Rather,
    it should be seen as an explanation of how\n   some existing, concrete IETF VPN
    and traffic-engineering technologies\n   can be used to create IETF network slices.
    \ Note that there are a\n   number of these technologies, and new technologies
    or capabilities\n   keep being added.  This memo is also not intended presume
    any\n   particular technology choice.\n\n   &lt;DAb&gt;\n\n   This document provides
    a definition of the term \"IETF Network Slice\"\n   for use within the IETF and
    specifically as a reference for other\n   IETF documents that describe or use
    aspects of network slices.\n\n   The document also describes the characteristics
    of an IETF network\n   slice, related terms and their meanings, and explains how
    IETF\n   network slices can be used in combination with end-to-end network\n   slices
    or independent of them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
