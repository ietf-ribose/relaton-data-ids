abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation
    \nProtocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks \n(also
    known as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application-\nlayer control
    (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and \nterminating sessions with
    one or more participants. These sessions \ninclude, in particular, telephone calls.
    QSIG is a signalling \nprotocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched
    \ncalls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated \nServices Networks
    (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of ECMA \nStandards and published also
    as ISO/IEC standards. \nAs the support of telephony within corporate networks
    evolves from \ncircuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the two \ntechnologies
    will co-exist in many networks for a period, perhaps \nseveral years. Therefore
    there is a need to be able to establish, \nmodify and terminate sessions involving
    a participant in the SIP\nnetwork and a participant in the QSIG network. Such
    calls are \nsupported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG.
    \nThis document is a product of the authors' activities in ECMA \n(www.ecma.ch)
    on interoperability of QSIG with IP networks. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
