abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Session mobility allows a user to transfer an ongoing communication
    \n   session from one device to another device. Seamless session mobility \n   is
    \ very  important  for  real  time  multimedia  applications.  This \n   document
    defines a new option tag in SIP to indicate media handling \n   feature during
    the transfer of communication session from one device \n   to another device to
    achieve seamless session transfer without \n   disruption of media streams. \n\t
