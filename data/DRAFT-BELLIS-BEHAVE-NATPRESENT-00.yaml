abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between\n
    \  packets that have been passed through a Network Address Translator\n   (NAT)
    and packets that have been passed along a clear end-to-end\n   path.  We propose
    mechanisms for IPv4 and IPv6 whereby NAT devices\n   explicitly signal their operation
    as a means of allowing applications\n   to distinguish the presence of otherwise
    undetected NATs in the end-\n   to-end path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
