abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLSprotection
    mechanism that can protect against link and node failure.It provides a fast protection
    switch mechanism to minimize trafficloss (typically sub 50msec) if the node that
    detects the failurelocally, does the repair by re-routing the protected traffic
    to goover the backup tunnel. A direct application of this mechanism to aring topology
    results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth thatcould also result in degraded
    service. This document describes amechanism to do it without such problems.</p>"
