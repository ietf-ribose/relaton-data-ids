abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media
    handling\n   in multi-party calls.  The main RTT transport is to carry Real-Time\n
    \  text by the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103\n   RFC
    4103 [RFC4103] .  The mechanisms enable the receiving application\n   to present
    the received real-time text medium separated per source,\n   in different ways
    according to user preferences.  Some presentation\n   related features are also
    described explaining suitable variations of\n   transmission and presentation
    of text.\n\n   Call control features are described for the SIP environment.  A\n
    \  number of alternative methods for providing the multi-party\n   negotiation,
    transmission and presentation are discussed and a\n   recommendation for the main
    one is provided.  The main solution for\n   centralized multi-party handling of
    real-time text is achieved\n   through a media control unit coordinating multiple
    RTP text streams\n   into one RTP stream.\n\n   Alternative methods using a single
    RTP stream and source\n   identification inline in the text stream are also described,
    one of\n   them being provided as a lower functionality fallback method for\n
    \  endpoints with no multi-party awareness for RTT.\n\n   Bridging methods where
    the text stream is carried untouched by the\n   bridge are also discussed.\n\n
    \  Brief information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n\t
