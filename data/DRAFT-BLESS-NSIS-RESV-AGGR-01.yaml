abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   QoS NSLP is a recently proposed signaling protocol that allows
    to\n   establish QoS reservations in the Internet.  In order to enable large\n
    \  scale deployment, inter-domain aggregation should be considered as\n   mechanism
    to allow for the necessary scalability in the control\n   plane.  This draft describes
    the major problems that must be solved\n   and proposes also solutions to these
    problems, requiring only modest\n   modifications and extensions to the currently
    defined GIST and QoS\n   NSLP specifications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
