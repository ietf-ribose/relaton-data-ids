abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined
    in\nRFC 5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encoded\nwithin
    the data packets instead of using a multicast group address.\nResearch is currently
    ongoing on two versions of XCAST6 and this\ndocument describes the design and
    implementation of a routing engine\nfor the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop
    options header has\nbeen eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for
    an\nXCAST6 routing engine, highlights the requirements for its\nimplementation,
    the design process and how to eventually implement\nthe routing engine to allow
    for deployment of XCAST6 protocol.\n\nConventions used in this document\n\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\nNOT\", \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\nthis document are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119\n[RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
