abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours\n
    \  and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet\n   and
    a particular set of requirements.  Policies, default parameters,\n   the options
    supported, the style of network management and security\n   requirements may vary.
    \ This document reviews examples of such\n   limited domains, also known as controlled
    environments, and emerging\n   solutions, and develops a related taxonomy.  It
    then briefly\n   discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains.\n
    \  Finally, it shows the needs for a precise definition of limited\n   domain
    membership and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain\n   securely and
    to find other members, including boundary nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
