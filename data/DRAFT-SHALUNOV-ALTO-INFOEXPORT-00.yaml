abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ALTO Information Export Service is a simple way to convey
    ISP\nrouting policy preferences to applications.  Applications that could\nuse
    this service are those that have a choice in connection\nendpoints.  Examples
    of such applications are peer-to-peer and\ncontent delivery networks.\n\nApplications
    already have access to great amount of underlying\ntopology information.  For
    example, views of the Internet routing\ntable are easily available at looking
    glass servers and entirely\npractical to download to every client.  What is missing
    is the\nrouting policy information -- what does the local ISP actually\nprefer?\n\nThis
    document describes a very simple mechanism that would allow to\nexport such information
    to applications.  While such service would\nprimarily be provided by the network,
    i.e., the local ISP, third\nparties could also operate this service.1.  Requirements
    notation\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].2.  Overview\n\nEach
    network region can choose to support the ALTO service.  (A\nnetwork region in
    this context is an Autonomous System, an ISP, or\nperhaps a smaller region --
    the details depend on the mechanism of\ndiscovery.)\n\nThe service works as follows:\n\n1.
    \ The ISP prepares the ALTO information.  This maps some IP\n\n prefixes or AS
    numbers into priority values.  Higher priority\n\n values indicate higher desirability
    of the prefix.  There is a\n\n default treatment for IP numbers that are in none
    of the prefixes\n\n or AS numbers.\n\n2.  The ISP serializes the information into
    a sequence of octets\n\n (Section 4).\n\n3.  The application, running on a given
    host, discovers the resource\n\n and fetches the serialized ALTO information (Section
    3).\n\n4.  The application makes use of the information by preferring IP\n\n numbers
    with higher priority (Section 5).\n\nThe part of the ISP MAY be implemented, to
    give a few examples that\ndo not preclude other implementation options,\n\n\nby
    running a script connecting to existing equipment, fetching\n\nrouting information,
    and then generating and uploading the\n\nrequisite file;\n\n\nby running a database-backed
    application that is obtains routing\n\ninformation from existing equipment and
    generates the requisite\n\nfile dynamically;\n\n\nby modifying the software or
    hardware of existing equipment to\n\nsupport these functions; or\n\n\nby using
    new equipment for the purpose of operating this network\n\nservice.3.  Discovery\n\nDiscovery
    per se is out of scope for this document and will be\nhandled separately.\n\nThe
    necessary property of discovery is that a client, starting from\nnothing on today's
    Internet that does not yet universally support\nglobal-scope multicast and may
    include NATs, can find a URL that\ndescribes the location of the local ALTO service,
    as configured by\nthe ISP.\n\nSubsequent sections assume that this URL is found.
    \ So that maximum\nnumber of clients can use the ALTO service, the URL schema
    SHOULD be\n\"http\" or \"https\".\n\t </p>\n      "
