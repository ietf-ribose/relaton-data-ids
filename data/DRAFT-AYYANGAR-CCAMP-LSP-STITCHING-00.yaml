abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In certain scenarios, there may be a need to combine together
    two\ndifferent Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label\nSwitched
    Paths (LSPs) such that in the data plane, a single end-to-end\n(e2e) LSP is achieved
    and all traffic from one LSP is switched onto the\nother LSP. We will refer to
    this as \"LSP stitching\". This document\ncovers cases where: a) the node performing
    the stitching does not\nrequire configuration of every LSP pair to be stitched
    together b) the\nnode performing the stitching is not the egress of any of the
    LSPs c)\nLSP stitching not only results in an end-to-end LSP in the data plane,\nbut
    there is also a corresponding end-to-end LSP (RSVP session) in the\ncontrol plane.
    It might be possible to configure a GMPLS node to switch\nthe traffic from an
    LSP for which it is the egress, to another LSP for\nwhich it is the ingress, without
    requiring any signaling or routing\nextensions whatsoever, completely transparent
    to other nodes. This will\nalso result in LSP stitching in the data plane. However,
    this document\ndoes not cover this scenario of LSP stitching.\n\t </p>\n      "
