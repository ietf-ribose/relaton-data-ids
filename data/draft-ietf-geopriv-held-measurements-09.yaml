abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-related
    measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location
    information. Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning
    properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data
    about network attachment or about the physical environment. A LIS is able to use
    the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location
    estimate it provides to the Device. A basic set of location-related measurements
    are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</p>"
