abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In reasonable home networks there are no cloud services; just
    a set\n   of local nodes sharing state, and possibly invoking operations either\n
    \  automatically or on behalf of the home user.  This document describes\n   a
    key-value database that can be used to do both; published\n   key=values represent
    the current state of the system, and by setting\n   a key published by some other
    node to a different value a node can\n   indicate the desire for changing of state.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
