abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the MultiPoint Relay Flooding (MPRF) protocol\nfor
    maintenance of efficient flooding structures in mobile ad-hoc\nnetworks.  The
    protocol is an adaptation of the classical flooding\nalgorithm, with the difference
    that many nodes are relieved of the\nresponsibility to relay flooded messages
    while still ensuring that\nall nodes receive the messages.  The key concept used
    in the protocol\nis that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes
    which\nare the only nodes needed to forward messages during the flooding\nprocess.
    \ This technique substantially reduces the message overhead\nas compared to the
    more straightforward and well-known flooding\nmechanism, where every node retransmits
    each message just once, upon\nreceiving the first copy of the message. The protocol
    is particularly\nsuitable for dense networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
