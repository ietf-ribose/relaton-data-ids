abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication
    framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to
    permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transfer
    Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs). The ultimate goal of this framework
    is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus proving
    and protecting message sender identity and the integrity of the messages they
    convey while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today.
    Proof and protection of email identity, including repudiation and non-repudiation,
    may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".</p>
