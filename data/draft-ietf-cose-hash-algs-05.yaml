abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]
    does not define any direct methods for using hash algorithms. There are, however,
    circumstances where hash algorithms are used, such as indirect signatures where
    the hash of one or more contents are signed, and X.509 certificate or other object
    identification by the use of a fingerprint. This document defines a set of hash
    algorithms that are identified by COSE Algorithm Identifiers.</p>"
