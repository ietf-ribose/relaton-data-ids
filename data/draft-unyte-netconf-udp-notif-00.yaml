abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism to collect
    data from networking devices. A shim header is proposed to facilitate the streaming
    of data directly from line cards to a collector. The objective is to rely on a
    lightweight approach to allow for higher frequency and better transit performance
    compared to already established notification mechanisms.</p>"
