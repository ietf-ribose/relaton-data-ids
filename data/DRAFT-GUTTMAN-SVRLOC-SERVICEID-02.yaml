abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) allows clients to discover\nservices
    with little or no prior configuration.  SLP can be used to\nadvertise services
    of any kind through the use of URLs.  However, SLP\nuses URLs for two purposes:
    as a LOCATOR (indicating the location of\nthe service) and as an IDENTIFIER (used
    for subsequent operations on\na service, such as registration, deregistration
    and looking up\nattributes.)  Confounding these two functions in one object leads
    to\ncertain problems.  The serviceid: scheme separates identification\nfrom location,
    eliminating these problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
