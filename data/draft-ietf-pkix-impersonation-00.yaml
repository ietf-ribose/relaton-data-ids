abstract:
- content: "<p>This document forms a certificate profile for Impersonation Certificates,
    based on X.509 PKI certificates as defined in draft- ietf-pkix-new-part1-04.txt
    (the draft update to RFC 2459), for use in the Internet. The term Impersonation
    Certificate is used to describe a certificate that is derived from, and signed
    by, a normal X.509 Public Key End Entity Certificate or by another Impersonation
    Certificate for the purpose of providing impersonation within a PKI based authentication
    system.</p>"
