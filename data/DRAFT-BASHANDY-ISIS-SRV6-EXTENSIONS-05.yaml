abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called\n   \"segments\".
    \ Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an\n   MPLS data plane
    as well as an IPv6 data plane.  This draft describes\n   the IS-IS extensions
    required to support Segment Routing over an IPv6\n   data plane.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
