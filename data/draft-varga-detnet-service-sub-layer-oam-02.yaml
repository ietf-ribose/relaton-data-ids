abstract:
- content: "<p>Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tools are essential
    for a deterministic network. The DetNet architecture [RFC8655] has defined two
    sub-layers: (1) DetNet service sub-layer and (2) DetNet forwarding sub-layer.
    OAM mechanisms exist for the DetNet forwarding sub-layer. Nonetheless, OAM for
    the service sub-layer might require new extensions to the existing OAM protocols.
    This draft presents an analysis of OAM procedures for the DetNet service sub-layer
    functions.</p>"
