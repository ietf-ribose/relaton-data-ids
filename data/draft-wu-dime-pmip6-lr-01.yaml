abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by
    thethe Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typicallytunneled
    to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term\"localized routing\" refers
    to a method by which packets are routeddirectly by the MAG without involving the
    LMA. In order to establisha localized routing session between two Mobile Access
    Gateways in aProxy Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished:1. The usage
    of local routing must be authorized for both MAGs and2. The address of the MAG
    to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is attached must be discoveredThis document
    specifies how to accomplish these tasks using theDiameter protocol</p>"
