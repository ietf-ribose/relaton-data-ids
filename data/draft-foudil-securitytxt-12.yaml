abstract:
- content: <p>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper
    reporting channels are often lacking. As a result, vulnerabilities may be left
    unreported. This document defines a machine-parsable format ("security.txt") to
    help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make it
    easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.</p>
