abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer's issue, it is not easy
    to\nmandate all the applications in the host to change in the first\nplace, the
    network layer may have to have a solution to support the\nconventional IPv4 appliations
    during the IPv6 migration such as in\nthe dual stack or IPv6 only network, especially
    when multiple\napplications need to be supported.  This document describes a\nmechanism
    for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technology\nwhich could guarantee
    IPv4 application backward compatibility.\nApplications need not necessarily to
    understand what the network\nconnection and the destination's IP family type are.
    \ A well-known\nprefix could be used when the destination is public IPv4 Internet's\naddress.\n\t
