abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet
    in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy
    can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some
    regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could
    be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6. It shows how to make
    a transition from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with
    the existing network.</p>"
