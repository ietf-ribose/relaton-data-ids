abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's
    machine\n   is configured with the user's identities.  This will require\n   something
    on that machine which will manage the user's identities and\n   services.  Anyone
    designing that \"something\" will face the same set\n   of challenges.  This document
    aims to document these challenges with\n   the aim of producing well-thought out
    UIs with some consistency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
