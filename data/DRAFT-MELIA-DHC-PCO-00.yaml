abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies how to convey Protocol Configuration Options\n(PCO)
    [24008] from/to the access network to/from the Mobile Node\n(MN).  There are scenarios
    defined in 3GPP (TS 23.402) and WiMax\nforum NWG where the mobile node accessing
    the non-3GPP trusted system\nneeds to convey such information to the Mobility
    Access Gateway (MAG)\nfunctionality implemented in the serving gateway (S-GW).
    \ The MAG\nrequires the PCO field to send such information to the Local Mobility\nAgent
    (LMA) (implemented in the PDN gateway, P-GW) in a Proxy Binding\nUpdate (PBU)
    message.  PCO options are exchanged between the MN and\nthe LMA to transport information
    such as P-CSCF address, DNS server\naddress.\n\t </p>\n      "
