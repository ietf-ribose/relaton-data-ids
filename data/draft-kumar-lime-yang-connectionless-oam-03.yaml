abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless OAM
    protocols. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
    for connectionless protocols. Based model presented here can be extended to include
    technology specific details. This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols
    and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different
    or same levels through a unified interface).</p>"
