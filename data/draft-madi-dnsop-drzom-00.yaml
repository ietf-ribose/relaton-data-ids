abstract:
- content: "<p>Given responsibilities and importance it bears, DNS root system architecture
    remains largely unchanged. Over the years, the topics together with some proposals
    of scaling the root have been discussed in various communities, trying to offer
    solutions or insights to a specific issue of DNS root operation. This document
    gathers and describes issues relating to the root zone operation and management
    and comb corresponding technical requirements for evolution directions of root
    zone operation and management in new groundwork.</p>"
