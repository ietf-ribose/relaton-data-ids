abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that
    a certain domain name does not exist. It is also used to signal that a domain
    name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were asking for. When
    returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server usually includes up to two
    NSEC records. With NSEC3 this amount is three. This document provides additional
    background commentary and some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used
    by DNSSEC to provide authenticated denial of existence responses</p>"
