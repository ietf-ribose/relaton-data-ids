abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need
    to pass\n   through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to\n
    \  Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how\n   to
    accomplish this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label\n   Switches
    Paths are established using mLDP.\n\n\nSpecification of Requirements\n\t </p>\n
