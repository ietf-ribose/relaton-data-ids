abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Links are omnipresent in the Internet to provide access to
    other\n   resources.  There is no mechanism to express differences in law\n   systems,
    access limitations, or arbitrary rules defined by the owner\n   of the linked
    resource.  Therefore links do depend on and enforce a\n   communist sharing ideology,
    which ignores the content owner rights.\n\n   Links may point to resources far
    away from the originating page,\n   hiding this fact from the customer.  It takes
    the data transport\n   services for free, internet transit providers on the way
    from the\n   content source to the customers are not extra payed for this effort.\n
    \  In many cases, the remote company generates huge amount of money from\n   the
    customers worldwide not shared with the transit providers.\n\n   In order to get
    the rights of all involved parties balanced, a new\n   type of connection initiation
    is proposed: The Right.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
