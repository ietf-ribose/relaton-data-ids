abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011
    will be\n   World IPv6 Day, on which some major organisations are going to make\n
    \  their content available over IPv6.  With the likes of Google and\n   Facebook
    providing IPv6 access to their production services and\n   domains, it is very
    likely we will see more IPv6 traffic flowing\n   across the Internet than has
    ever been seen before.  With this in\n   mind, it seems timely to issue a call
    to arms for systems and network\n   administrators to review their organisation's
    IPv6 capabilities in\n   order to mitigate common causes of IPv6 connectivity
    problems in\n   advance of the day.  The increased traffic on World IPv6 Day should\n
    \  also create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and\n   performance
    of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate\n   measurement tools in
    place in advance.  We discuss some appropriate\n   tools from the network and
    application perspective.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
