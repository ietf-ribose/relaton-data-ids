abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a handover authentication protocol based
    on \nthe AAA server in FMIPv6. The proposed scheme employs the Diffie-\nHellman
    (DH) algorithm to enhance security aspects, and modifies the \nDH key exchange
    to reduce computational cost at the Mobile Node (MN) \nby delegating exponential
    operation to the AAA server. The MN and \nAccess Router (AR) establish the handover
    key HK through the AAA \nserver. The main advantage of this document is more secure
    and \nsuitable to a light-weight mobile terminal.\n\t </p>\n      "
