abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies the configuration information that will be
    used \nto define, establish,activate, and maintain tunnel facilities. As IP-\nbased
    services, such as VPNs, grow in popularity, tunnel \nconfiguration and management
    becomes ever more important since these \nservices and mechanisms proposed for
    their deployment are based on \ntunnels and tunneling protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
