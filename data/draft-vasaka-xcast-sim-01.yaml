abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Sender Initiated Multicast (SIM) is a point-to-multipoint multicastmechanism.
    SIM will not replace the existing multicast protocol, butwill be a subset of entire
    multicast protocol suite. Its design goalsare to gain more simplicity than the
    traditional IP multicast and togain less header-processing overhead than the Xcast
    protocol. Iteliminates the cost of allocating global multicast address, byrouting
    packets according to receiver unicast addresses attached topacket headers. Access
    control can be introduced before, members ofa receiving group are explicitly specified
    by the sender. A group isidentified by the combination of sender's unicast address
    and amulticast group address. The key feature of SIM is in its Presetmode, which
    can lessen the costs of route lookups and provides cost-efficient packet forwarding
    by using a SIM Forwarding InformationBase (FIB) maintained on routers. Moreover,
    a SIM tunnel will beautomatically created between two routers that act as multicastbranching
    points. Therefore, SIM can gain scalability by maintainingFIB entries only on
    the branching routers.In this document, we describe SIM including its delivery
    models, SIMFIB operations, the formats, and security considerations.</p>"
