abstract:
  content: "<p>The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol was developedfrom
    the experience of MIPv6 and the facilities provided by linklayer triggers, allowing
    for a proactive approach to handover thatminimises packet exchange delay and packet
    loss. On completion ofhandover, the mobile node engages MIPv6 procedures in to
    update theHome Agent with the mobile node's new location. Subsequently, themobile
    node may carry out Return Routability with the correspondentnode(s) for route
    optimization. However, this method leaves scope tooptimize handover delays derived
    from the signalling messageexchange.This document proposes an enhancement to FMIPv6,
    the Proactive RouteOptimization for FMIPv6 (PRO-FMIPv6) protocol, which aims to
    furtherreduce the signalling load thereby improving the overall performanceof
    the handover process.</p>"
