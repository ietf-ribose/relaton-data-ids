abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a problem statement and general requirements\n
    \  for distributed autonomic configuration of multiple aspects of\n   networks,
    in particular carrier networks.  The basic model is that\n   network elements
    need to negotiate configuration settings with each\n   other to meet overall goals.
    \ The document describes a generic\n   negotiation behavior model.  The document
    also reviews whether\n   existing management and configuration protocols may be
    suitable for\n   autonomic networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
