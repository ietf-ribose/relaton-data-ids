abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RBridge edge nodes currently learn the mapping between MAC
    addresses\n   and their corresponding RBridge edge nodes by observing the data\n
    \  packets traversed through. When ingress RBridge receives a data\n   packet
    with its destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) unknown, the data\n   packet is flooded
    across RBridge domain. When there are more than\n   one RBridge ports connected
    to one bridged LAN, only one of them can\n   be designated as AF port for forwarding/receiving
    traffic for each\n   LAN, the rest have to be blocked for that LAN.\n\n   This
    draft describes why and how directory assisted RBridge edge can\n   improve TRILL
    network scalability in data center environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
