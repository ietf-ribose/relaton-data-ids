abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a protocol for obtaining cross-realm
    Kerberos\n   tickets using existing, related protocols.  The resulting protocol\n
    \  has a number of desirable security properties, including privacy\n   protection
    for the user relative to their home realm's\n   infrastructure, as well a support
    for leap-of-faith trust\n   establishment, and automated cross-realm keying.  This
    protocol\n   allows Kerberos to scale to large numbers of realms.\n\n\t </p>\n
