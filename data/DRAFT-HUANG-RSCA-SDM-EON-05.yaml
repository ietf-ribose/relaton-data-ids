abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documentary provides a routing, spectrum and core assignment\n
    \  method with the dividing frequency slots area for space division\n   multiplexing
    elastic optical networks. This effective RSCA method to\n   solve this problem
    better. The proposed method utilizes the Frequency\n   Slots Area (FSA) concept
    and first-last fit policy of frequency slots\n   assignment to have less spectrum
    fragments, lower crosstalk, smaller\n   traffic blocking probability and higher
    spectrum resource utilization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
