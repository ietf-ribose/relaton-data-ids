abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached\n
    \  to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers\n   that
    provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and\n   redirection
    services for route optimization.  AERO provides an IPv6\n   link-local address
    format known as the AERO address that supports\n   operation of the IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6\n   ND to IP forwarding.  Admission control
    and provisioning are\n   supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6), and node mobility is naturally supported through dynamic\n
    \  neighbor cache updates.  Although DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND messaging are\n   used
    in the control plane, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported in the\n   data plane.
    \ AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution using\n   standard control messaging
    exchanges as described in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
