abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new OSPF flow specification (FlowSpec)
    Opaque\n   Link State Advertisement (LSA) encoding format that can be used to\n
    \  distribute traffic flow specifications.\n\n   Additionally, this document proposes
    to assign label for the FlowSpec\n   route in order to generate one or more LSPs,
    which would improve the\n   route lookup performance in the data plane.\n\n   For
    the network not deploying BGP or the internal nodes in an AS, it\n   is expected
    to extend IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol ) to distribute\n   FlowSpec routes.
    \ One application is to mitigate denial-of-service\n   attacks as close to the
    attacker as possible, the other is to\n   generate LSPs for the FlowSpec routes
    in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
