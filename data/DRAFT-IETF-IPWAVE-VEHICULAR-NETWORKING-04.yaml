abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    on IP-\n   based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of\n
    \  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of\n   vehicular
    networking are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-\n   infrastructure (V2I),
    and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking.\n   First, this document surveys use
    cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X\n   networking.  Second, it analyzes proposed protocols
    for IP-based\n   vehicular networking and highlights the limitations and difficulties\n
    \  found on those protocols.  Third, it presents a problem exploration\n   for
    key aspects in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery,
    Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy.  For\n   each key aspect, this
    document discusses a problem statement to\n   analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art
    techniques and\n   requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.\n\n\t </p>\n
