abstract:
  content: '<p>The current Internet fairness paradigm mandates that all protocolshave
    equivalent response to packet loss, such that relatively simplenetwork devices
    can attain a weak form of fairness by sending uniformsignals to all flows. This
    "TCP-friendly" paradigm has been thepolicy of the IETF for nearly two decades.
    Although it was only aninformal policy in the beginning, it progressively became
    more formalfollowing the publication of RFC 2001 in 1997.However we observe two
    trends that differ from this policy: anincreasing number of environments where
    applications and othercircumstances create situations that are "unfair", and ISPs
    that areresponding to these situation by imposing traffic control in thenetwork
    itself.This note explores the question of whether TCP-friendly paradigm isstill
    appropriate for the huge breadth of technology and scaleencompassed by today''s
    global Internet. It considers the merits anddifficulties of changing IETF policy
    to embrace these changes byprogressively moving the responsibility for capacity
    allocation fromthe end-system to the network. Ultimately this policy change mighteliminate
    or redefine the requirement that all protocols be "TCP-Friendly".This note is
    intended foster discussion in the community andeventually become input to the
    IESG and IAB, where it might evolveinto a future architecture statement.</p>'
