abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering
    to deploy\n   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a\n
    \  consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting\n   these
    local CDNs.  The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs\n   are currently
    being defined in the Content Delivery Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) WG.
    \ This document focuses on the CDNI\n   Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement
    interface (FCI).\n   Specifically, this document outlines how the solutions currently\n
    \  being defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG\n   can
    facilitate Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement in a CDNI\n   context, i.e.
    how the CDNI FCI can be realised with the ALTO\n   protocol.  Concrete examples
    of how ALTO can be integrated within\n   CDNI request routing and in particular
    in the process of selecting a\n   downstream CDN are given.  The examples in this
    document are based on\n   the use cases and examples currently being discussed
    in the CDNI WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
