abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an information retrieval protocol for
    digital \nlibrary. This protocol has two parts: standard search Webservice, \nwhich
    defines the format of query words and the search results; a \nmethod to find and
    select such search Webservice. By using this \nprotocol, all the databases including
    web page database, digital \nissue database, and video database, can release the
    uniform search \nWebservice, though these databases may have different metadata
    \nstandards and architectures. And these Webservice can be easily found \nand
    visited by search systems. This very protocol makes it possible \nthat users can
    obtain all kinds of information on the Internet in \nsingle search engine, but
    not visit lots of different search engines \none by one. \n\t </p>\n      "
