abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document captures initial thoughts about having IETF meetings\n
    \  that are completely virtual.  It explores the issues involved with\n   both
    a \"planned\" virtual meeting and an \"emergency\" virtual meeting.\n   The intent
    is to evolve this document to provide answers to the\n   questions posed throughout
    the text.  This is currently a thought\n   experiment.  There are no current plans
    to hold a completely virtual\n   IETF meeting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
