abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines the two artifacts "voucher" and "voucher- revocation",
    which are YANG-defined structures that have been signed by a TBD algorithm. The
    voucher artifact is generated by the device's manufacture or delegate. The voucher's
    purpose is to securely assign one or more devices to an owner. The voucher informs
    each device which entity it should consider to be its owner. The voucher revocation
    artifact is used by the manufacturer or delegate (i.e. the issuer of the voucher)
    to revoke vouchers, if ever necessary. The voucher revocation format defined herein
    supports both issuer-wide and voucher-specific constructs, enabling usage flexibility.
    For both artifacts, this memo only defines the artifact, leaving it to future
    work to describe specialized protocols for accessing them.</p>
