abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a newset of headers,
    which can significantly reduce the network trafficused for sending pages containing
    advertising banners and otherrelated content. We begin by describing the problems
    generated by theuse of 'cache-busting' techniques today and why the Hit-meteringscheme
    [RFC2227], by itself, may not be adequate. We will thendescribe a new scheme which
    relies on collaboration between thecontent providers and the Internet Service
    Providers (ISPs).</p>"
