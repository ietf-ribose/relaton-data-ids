abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ SR is\n   applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n
    \  (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedures for Enhanced\n   Performance
    and Liveness Monitoring of end-to-end SR paths including\n   SR Policies for both
    SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes, those reduce the\n   deployment and operational
    complexities in a network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
