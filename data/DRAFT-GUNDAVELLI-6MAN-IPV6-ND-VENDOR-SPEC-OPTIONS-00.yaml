abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The current IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification does not provide\nsemantics
    for carrying vendor-specific options in the IPv6 Neighbor\nDiscovery messages.
    \ With the anticipated wide scale deployment of\nIPv6 networks, it is useful for
    organizations and vendors to have the\nability to carry organization/vendor specific
    information in the IPv6\nNeighbor Discovery messages.  This will facilitate the
    vendors and\norganizations to make deployment specific extensions as needed in\nsystem
    deployment.  This document defines a new vendor-specific\ninformation option that
    can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\nmessages exchanged between IPv6 nodes
    on a link.\n\t </p>\n      "
