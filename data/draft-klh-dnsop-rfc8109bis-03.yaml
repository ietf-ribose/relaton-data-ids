abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the queries that a DNS resolver should emit
    to initialize its cache. The result is that the resolver gets both a current NS
    Resource Record Set (RRset) for the root zone and the necessary address information
    for reaching the root servers. This document, when published, obsoletes RFC 8109.</p>"
