abstract:
- content: "<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
    SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages they receive.
    Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through
    its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable
    to overload. This document discusses models and design considerations for a SIP
    overload control mechanism.</p>"
