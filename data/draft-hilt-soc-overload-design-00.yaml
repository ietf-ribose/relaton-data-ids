abstract:
  content: "<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks whenSIP
    servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messagesthey receive. Even
    though the SIP protocol provides a limitedoverload control mechanism through its
    503 (Service Unavailable)response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.
    Thisdocument discusses models and design considerations for a SIPoverload control
    mechanism.</p>"
