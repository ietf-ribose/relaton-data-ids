abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to become an Informational RFC on
    the\n   independent stream.  The document does not specify any new protocol\n
    \  or procedures.  It does explain how the MPLS standards\n   implementation,
    has been deployed and operated to meet the\n   requirements from operators that
    offer traditional Virtual Leased\n   Line services.\n\n   This document describes
    an MPLS/IP network that has an infrastructure\n   that can be separated into two
    or more strata.  For the\n   implementation described in this document the infrastructure
    has been\n   separated into two strata.  One for the 'Hard Pipes', called the\n
    \  'Hard Pipe Stratum\".  And one for the normal IP/MPLS traffic - called\n   the
    'Normal IP/MPLS stratum'.\n\n   This document introduces the concept of \"Hard
    Pipes\", a Hard Pipe is\n   an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or a Pseudowire
    (PW) with a\n   bandwidth that is guaranteed and can neither be exceeded nor\n
    \  infringed upon.\n\n   The Hard Pipe stratum does not use statistical multiplexing,
    for the\n   LSPs and PWs setup within this stratum the bandwidth are guaranteed\n
    \  end to end.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
