abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability
    to\nprovide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when\nthe
    user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header.\nHowever, the reference
    addresses only network resources with specific\nrendering properties.  There is
    currently no support for predefined\nstandard identifiers for describing the semantics
    of the alerting\nsituation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without\nbeing
    tied to a particular rendering.  To overcome this limitation\nand support new
    applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP\nAlert-Info header fields is
    defined in this specification.\n\t </p>\n      "
