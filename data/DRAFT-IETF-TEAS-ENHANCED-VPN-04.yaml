abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual
    Private\n   Network (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to support the needs of new\n
    \  applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G\n   services,
    by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and\n   TE technologies
    and adds features that specific services require\n   over and above traditional
    VPNs.\n\n   Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network\n
    \  slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing\n   enhanced connectivity
    services between customer sites.\n\n   It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will
    be delivered using a\n   combination of existing, modified, and new networking
    technologies.\n   This document provides an overview of relevant technologies
    and\n   identifies some areas for potential new work.\n\n   It is not envisaged
    that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be\n   deployed in a network and, in
    particular, it is not intended that\n   all VPNs supported by a network will use
    VPN+ related techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
