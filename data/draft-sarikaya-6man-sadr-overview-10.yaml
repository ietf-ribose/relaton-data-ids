abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the source address dependent routing (SADR)
    problem space from the host perspective. Both multihomed hosts and hosts with
    multiple interfaces are considered. Several network architectures are presented
    to illustrate why source address selection and next hop resolution in view of
    source address dependent routing is needed. The document is scoped on identifying
    a set of scenarios for source address dependent routing from the host perspective
    and analyze a set of solutions to mitigate encountered issues. The document does
    not make any solution recommendations.</p>"
