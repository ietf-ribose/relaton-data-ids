abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the conventions for digital signatures on RFCs
    and Internet-Draft documents. For Internet-Drafts, the Cryptographic Message Syntax
    (CMS) is used to create a detached signature, which is stored in a separate companion
    file so that no existing utilities are impacted by the addition of the digital
    signature. For RFCs, an embedded digital signature is included in Portable Document
    Format (PDF) files types in addition to the detached signature in a separate companion
    file. This document (once approved) obsoletes RFC 5485.</p>"
