abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Authentication Received Chain (ARC) provides a means to
    preserve\n   email authentication results and verify the identity of email message\n
    \  handlers, each of which participates by inserting certain header\n   fields
    before passing the message on.  But the specification does not\n   indicate how
    intermediaries and receivers should interpret or utilize\n   ARC.  This document
    will provide guidance in these areas.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
