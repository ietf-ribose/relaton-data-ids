abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To assess performance problems,  this document describes optional\n
    \  headers embedded in each packet that provide sequence numbers and\n   timing
    information as a basis for measurements.  Such measurements\n   may be interpreted
    in real-time or after the fact. An implementation\n   of the existing IPv6 Destination
    Options extension header, the\n   Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination
    Options\n   extension header as well as the field limits, calculations, and usage\n
    \  of the PDM in measurement are included in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
