abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document evaluates the performance of a header compression\nprotocol
    for RTP, CRTP [RFC-2509], over links built on cellular radio\naccess technology.
    The key characteristics affecting CRTP performance\nover such links are the high
    error rates and the relatively long\nroundtrip time over the link.\nBandwidth
    is typically expensive in cellular radio access networks,\nsaving a single octet
    per voice packet can be equivalent to saving\nmany billion dollars in deployment
    since fewer base-stations are\nneeded. This is beneficial for operators as well
    as end-users who can\nget cheaper wireless IP telephony service.\nCRTP performance
    is evaluated for two kinds of link layers operating\nover a realistic radio channel
    with high bit-error rates. Two main\nconclusions are drawn. The first is that
    CRTP does not perform well\nfor this type of link. The second is that in high-error
    environments\nit is very beneficial to have a checksum covering the compressed\nheader
    only, not the payload, so that the decompressor sees all non-\ndamaged headers.
    When a strong checksum covers the entire link layer\nframe, header compression
    performs badly since too many headers are\ndiscarded due to damaged payloads.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
