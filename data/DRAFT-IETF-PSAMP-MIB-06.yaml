  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines managed objects for sampling and filtering\ntechniques
    for IP packet selection.  These objects provide\ninformation about managed nodes
    supporting packet sampling, including\npacket sampling capabilities and configuration.
    \ They also allow to\nconfigure packet sampling concerning the IP interface at
    which\npackets are sampled and the packet selections methods used for\nsampling.\n\n\t
