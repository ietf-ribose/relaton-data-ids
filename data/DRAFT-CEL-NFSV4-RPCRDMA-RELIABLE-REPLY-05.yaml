abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RPC transports such as RPC-over-RDMA version 1 require reply
    buffers\n   to be in place before an RPC Call is sent.  However, RPC consumers\n
    \  sometimes have difficulty estimating the expected maximum size of a\n   particular
    RPC reply.  This introduces the risk that an RPC Reply\n   message can overrun
    reply resources provided by the requester,\n   preventing delivery of the message,
    through no fault of the\n   requester.  This document describes a mechanism that
    eliminates the\n   need for pre-allocation of reply resources for unpredictably
    large\n   replies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
