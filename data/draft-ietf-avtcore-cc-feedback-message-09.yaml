abstract:
- content: "<p>An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine-grained
    feedback on packet loss, timing, and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marks
    than is provided by the standard RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR)
    and Receiver Report (RR) packets. This document describes an RTCP feedback message
    intended to enable congestion control for interactive real-time traffic using
    RTP. The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control
    algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to the sender RTCP
    feedback packets containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion
    control.</p>"
