abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a STUN usage that enables WebRTC\n
    \  implementations to verify the peer consent for continuing to receive\n   traffic
    on a candidate pair ICE is using for a media component after\n   session establishment.
    \ Verification of peer consent is necessary to\n   ensure that a malicious JavaScript
    cannot use the browser as a\n   platform for launching attacks.  This form of
    consent verification\n   also serves the purpose of refreshing NAT bindings.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
