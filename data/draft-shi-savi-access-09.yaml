abstract:
  content: "<p>Internet is always confronted with many security threats based on IP
    address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic redirection.
    Unfortunately, the Internet architecture fails to provide the defense mechanism.
    Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source
    address spoofing. Especially, the mechanism is essential for ISPs. However, due
    to the diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI solution is also different
    accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network,
    and moreover, states its SAVI requirements and tentative solutions accordingly.</p>"
