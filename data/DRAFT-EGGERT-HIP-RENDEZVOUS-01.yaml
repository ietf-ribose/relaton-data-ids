abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses rendezvous mechanisms for the Host Identity\n
    \  Protocol (HIP). Rendezvous mechanisms, such as HIP Rendezvous\n   Servers,
    improve operation when HIP nodes are multi-homed or mobile.\n   They can also
    facilitate communication between HIP and non-HIP nodes.\n   Possible rendezvous
    mechanisms differ in performance, compatibility,\n   and impact on the HIP and
    Internet architectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
