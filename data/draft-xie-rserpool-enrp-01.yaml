abstract:
- content: "<p>Endpoint Name Resolution Protocol (ENRP) is designed to work in conjunction
    with Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) [ASAP]. ENRP when combined with ASAP
    provdes a fault tolerant data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a
    name-based addressing model which isolates a logical communication endpoint from
    its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication
    endpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes a single point
    of failure. The fault tolerant server pooling is gained by combining the two parts,
    namely ASAP and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP). ASAP provides the user
    interface for name to address translation, load sharing management, and fault
    management. ENRP defines the fault tolerant name translation service.</p>"
