abstract:
  content: "<p>Endpoint Name Resolution Protocol (ENRP) is designed to work inconjunction
    with Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) [ASAP]. ENRP when combined with ASAP
    provdes a fault tolerant data transfer mechanismover IP networks. ASAP uses a
    name-based addressing model whichisolates a logical communication endpoint from
    its IP address(es),thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communicationendpoint
    and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes asingle point of failure.The
    fault tolerant server pooling is gained by combining the two parts,namely ASAP
    and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP). ASAPprovides the user interface
    for name to address translation, loadsharing management, and fault management.
    ENRP defines the faulttolerant name translation service.</p>"
