abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] requires\n
    \  configuration of a static \"VP-List\" on all routers.  The VP-List\n   allows
    routers to know which prefixes may or may not be FIB-\n   installed.  This draft
    specified an optional method of determining\n   this that requires far less configuration.
    \ Specifically, it requires\n   the configuration of a \"VP-Range\" in ASBRs connected
    to transit and\n   peer ISPs.  A Non-transitive Extended Communities Attribute
    is used\n   to convey to other routers that a given route can be FIB-suppressed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
