    in simplifying the implementation and configurationof routing policies between
    two or more VPN service providers.It is assumed that RFC2547 has been implemented
    to provide theVPN service although this is not a requirement of this applicationIt

    can be used by customers to select the best gatewaybetween one or more VPN service
    providers. This technique simplifiesconfiguration and management at the provider
    level, and gives thecustomer the ability to control its own routing policy with
    respectto the selection of gateways between service providers.</p>"
