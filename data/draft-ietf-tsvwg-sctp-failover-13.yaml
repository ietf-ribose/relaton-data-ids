abstract:
- content: "<p>SCTP supports multi-homing. However, when the failover operation specified
    in RFC4960 is followed, there can be significant delay and performance degradation
    in the data transfer path failover. To overcome this problem this document specifies
    a quick failover algorithm (SCTP-PF) based on the introduction of a Potentially
    Failed (PF) state in SCTP Path Management. The document also specifies a dormant
    state operation of SCTP. This dormant state operation is required to be followed
    by an SCTP-PF implementation, but it may equally well be applied by a standard
    RFC4960 SCTP implementation. Additionally, the document introduces an alternative
    switchback operation mode called Primary Path Switchover that will be beneficial
    in certain situations. This mode of operation applies to both a standard RFC4960
    SCTP implementation as well as to a SCTP-PF implementation. The procedures defined
    in the document require only minimal modifications to the RFC4960 specification.
    The procedures are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</p>"
