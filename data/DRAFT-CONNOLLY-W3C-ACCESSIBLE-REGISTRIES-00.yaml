  content: "\n\t <p>Registries are a critical part of many of the systems which inhabit\nthe
    Internet today.  Unfortunately, not a lot of the assignments\nwithin those registries
    are as accessible as they could be.  This\ndocument outlines a best current practice
    approach to improving the\naccessibility of assignments within registries using
    ubiquitous\ntechnologies and low cost supporting policies.\n\t </p>\n      "
