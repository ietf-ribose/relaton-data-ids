abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service
    orVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging andtunneling of
    Ethernet traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE)or Customer Edge (CE) and
    Provider Edge (PE), respectively. Thisdecoupling of functions allows an operator
    to provision point-to-point transport of Ethernet services for customer on PEs,
    whileleveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards theappropriate
    point-to-point Ethernet service leading to thedestination node. This decoupling
    of functions also allow providersto leverage existing network infrastructures
    to enable VPLS whileeasing migration to new network infrastructures. This approach
    scalesas the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers'emulated
    LAN sites span over a large wide area network. It is alsothe intention to show
    that an interface like Ethernet can be offeredto customers and emulated LAN services
    can be enabled, but it is notmandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies (or
    PE-based type ofVPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing andheterogeneous
    access technologies can be supported in a commonnetwork infrastructure.</p>"
