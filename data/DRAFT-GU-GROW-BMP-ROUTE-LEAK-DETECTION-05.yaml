abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   According to Route-Leak Problem Definition [RFC7908], Route
    leaks\n   refer to the case that the delivery range of route advertisements is\n
    \  beyond the expected range.  For many current security protection\n   solutions,
    the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are focusing on\n   finding ways to prevent
    the happening of BGP [RFC4271] route leaks.\n   However, the real-time route leak
    detection if any occurs is\n   important as well, and serves as the basis for
    leak mitigation.  This\n   document extends the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    [RFC7854] to\n   provide a routing security scheme suitable for ISPs to detect
    BGP\n   route leaks at the prefix level.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
