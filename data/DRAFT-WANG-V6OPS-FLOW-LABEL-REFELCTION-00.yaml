abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to\n
    \  differentiate the various traffic flow session within network.\n   Current
    related RFCs(RFC 6437 and RFC 6438 etc.)describe the IPv6\n   Flow Label generation
    recommendation and usage in network traffic\n   load balance. But all of these
    documents focus mainly how the packet\n   source forms the value of this field
    and how the forwarder in-path\n   treats it. None of the existing documents describes
    the relation\n   between the flow label from source nodes and its corresponding
    value\n   in return packet. This draft describes the requirements for flow\n   label
    reflection between the upstream session and the corresponding\n   downstream session,
    the benefit of this mirroring mechanism and its\n   influence to the current proposed
    IPv6 flow label usage. This\n   mechanism is unique to IPv6, and should be exploited
    to promote the\n   deployment of IPv6 technology in more rapid pace.\n\n\t </p>\n
