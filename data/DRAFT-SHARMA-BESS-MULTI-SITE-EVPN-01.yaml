abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the procedures for interconnecting
    two or\n   more BGP based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) sites in a scalable fashion over\n
    \  an IP-only network.  The motivation is to support extension of EVPN\n   sites
    without having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect\n   (DCI) technologies
    like MPLS/VPLS.  The requirements for such a\n   deployment are very similar to
    the ones specified in RFC 7209 --\n   \"Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
