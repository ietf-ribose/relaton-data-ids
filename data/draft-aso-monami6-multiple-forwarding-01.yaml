abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaceswhich
    uses Mobile IPv6[1]. With multiple interfaces, the mobileterminal may use them
    simultaneously for communication with a peerdevice. Hence enabling the mobile
    terminal to achieve faulttolerance, load balancing and so on. This document deals
    with themobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that eachkind/type
    of interface may have its own characteristics ordifferences.In particular, we
    take a closer look at the path between mobileterminal and its home agent. In the
    case when the mobile terminalhas multiple interfaces, there exists several paths
    to the homeagent. A general approach would be to first take a look at effectiveuse
    of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6 perspective.As a matter of
    course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference withwhich we consider the multiple
    interfaced mobile terminal operatingin a Mobile IPv6 environment.</p>"
