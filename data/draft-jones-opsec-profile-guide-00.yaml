abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides guidelines for creating security capabilityprofiles.
    A profile is a list of features that are required tooperate a device in a a secure
    manner in a specific environment.It is anticipated that what is required in a
    profile will vary overtime and, across different classes of devices (e.g. a network
    edgedevice may need to filter customer traffic whereas core networkdevices may
    not), and in different organizations. This document doesnot define a profile or
    specify requirements, but rather givesguidance for their creation.</p>"
