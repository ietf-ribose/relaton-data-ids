abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of
    an\n   ordered set of service functions and subsequent \"steering\" of traffic\n
    \  through them.  Service functions provide an specific treatment of\n   received
    packets, therefore they need to be known so they can be used\n   in a given service
    composition via SFC.  This document discusses the\n   need for service function
    discovery mechanisms and propose some\n   solutions for sfc-aware nodes to discover
    available service functions\n   in fog environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
