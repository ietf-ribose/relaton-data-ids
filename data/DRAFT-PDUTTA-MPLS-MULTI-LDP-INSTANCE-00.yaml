abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to Label Distribution Protocol\n
    \  (LDP) [RFC5036] for implementation of multiple LDP instances in a\n   network
    node, where all such instances share the common data plane.\n   Multiple LDP instances
    provide a method for operators for fate\n   separation of various LDP FEC Types
    as well as for network\n   segmentation.  The methods defined in this extension
    are backward\n   compatible with procedures defined in [RFC5036]\n\n\n\t </p>\n
