abstract:
- content: "<p>Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages, as data.
    For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses might want to be
    able to easily search those without having to decode the messages each time. Another
    example is a system that puts together DNS queries and responses from message
    parts. This document describes a general format for DNS message data in JSON.</p>"
