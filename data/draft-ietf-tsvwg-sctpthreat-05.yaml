abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes certain security threats to SCTP. It also describes
    ways to mitigate these threats, in particular by using techniques from the SCTP
    Specification Errata and Issues memo (RFC 4460). These techniques are included
    in RFC 4960, which obsoletes RFC 2960. It is hoped that this information will
    provide some useful background information for many of the newest requirements
    spelled out in the SCTP Specification Errata and Issues and included in RFC 4960.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
