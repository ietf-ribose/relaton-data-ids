abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow\n   state.  Neither
    does BIER require an explicit tree-building protocol\n   for its operation.  A
    multicast data packet enters a BIER domain at a\n   \"Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router\"
    (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at\n   one or more \"Bit-Forwarding Egress
    Routers\" (BFERs).  The BFIR router\n   adds a BIER header to the packet.  Such
    header contains a bit-string\n   in which each bit represents exactly one BFER
    to forward the packet\n   to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet
    needs to be\n   forwarded is expressed by the according set of bits set in BIER\n
    \  packet header.\n\n   This document describes the OSPFv3 [RFC8362] protocol
    extensions\n   required for BIER with MPLS encapsulation [RFC8296].  Support for\n
    \  other encapsulation types is outside the scope of this document.  The\n   use
    of multiple encapsulation types is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
