abstract:
- content: <p>In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits (referred
    as "Kyznyechik" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015
    includes an updated version of the block cipher with block length of n=64 bits
    and key length k=256 bits, which is also referred as "Magma". The algorithm is
    an updated version of older block cipher with block length of n=64 bits described
    in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830). This document is intended to be a source of information
    about the updated version of 64-bit cipher. It may facilitate the use of the block
    cipher in Internet applications by providing information for developers and users
    of GOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and
    decryption.</p>
