abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to
    Security Controller. The interface is expressed using objects and constructs understood
    by Security Admin as opposed to vendor or device specific expressions associated
    with individual product and feature. This document identifies a broad set of requirements
    needed to express security policies based on User-constructs which are well understood
    by User Community. This gives ability to decouple policy definition from policy
    enforcement on a specific element, be it a physical or virtual.</p>"
