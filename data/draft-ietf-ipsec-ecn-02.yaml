abstract:
  content: "<p>IPsec supports secure communication over potentially insecure networkcomponents
    such as intermediate routers. IPsec protocols support twooperating modes, transport
    mode and tunnel mode. Explicit CongestionNotification (ECN) is an experimental
    addition to the IP architecturethat provides notification of onset of congestion
    to delay- or loss-sensitive applications. ECN provides congestion notifications
    toenable adaptation to network conditions without the impact of droppedpackets
    [RFC 2481]. The use of two bits in the IPsec header for ECNexperimentation conflicts
    with header processing at IPsec tunnelendpoints in a manner that makes ECN unusable
    in the presence ofIPsec tunnels. This document considers issues related to thisconflict,
    describes two alternative solutions, and updates the IPsecarchitecture [RFC 2401]
    to include these alternatives. Support forone or the other of these alternatives
    is REQUIRED to remove theunderlying conflict.</p>"
