abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the ChaMeLeon (CML) routing protocoldesigned
    for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) supporting emergencycommunications. CML is
    a hybrid and adaptive routing protocoloperating within a defined disaster area
    denoted as the CriticalArea (CA). The main concept behind CML is the adaptability
    of itsrouting mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical stateof a
    MANET. For autonomous emergency communications, there is alikelihood that the
    network size will vary whenever more rescuersjoin or leave the network. In addition,
    battery exhaustion oflightweight mobile communication devices used by rescuers
    couldstipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence,this version
    of CML adapts its routing behavior according to changesin the network size within
    a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CMLroutes data proactively using the Optimized
    Link State Routing(OLSR) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the
    reactiveAd hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol so thatoverall
    routing performance is improved. These transitions occur viathe CML oscillation
    phase. This document focuses on the descriptionof the processes involved in the
    CML Cognitive and Adaptive Module(CAM), CML Oscillation phase and transition between
    phases.</p>"
