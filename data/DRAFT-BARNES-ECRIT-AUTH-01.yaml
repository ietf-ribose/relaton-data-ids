abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The use of Internet technologies for emergency calling creates\nopportunities
    for fraud, relative to traditional circuit-switched\nemergency calling.  This
    document describes the context for IP-based\nemergency calling, and the types
    of fraud which are possible within\nthe system.  A mitigation strategy for fraud
    against voice service\nproviders is described; techniques for detecting or preventing
    other\ntypes of fraud will be incorporated in this document as they are\navailable.\n\t
