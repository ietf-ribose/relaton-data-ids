abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end\n
    \  paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called\n   \"segments\".
    \ Segment Routing architecture can be implemented over an\n   MPLS data plane
    as well as an IPv6 data plane.  This draft describes\n   the OSPFv3 extensions
    required to support Segment Routing over an\n   IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\t
