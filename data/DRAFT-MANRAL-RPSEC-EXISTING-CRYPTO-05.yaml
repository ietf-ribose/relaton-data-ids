abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Routing protocols are designed to use cryptographic mechanisms
    to \n   authenticate data being received from a neighboring router to ensure \n
    \  that it has not been modified in transit, and actually originated \n   from
    the neighboring router purporting to have originating the data.  \n   Most of
    the cryptographic mechanisms defined to date rely on hash \n   algorithms applied
    to the data in the routing protocol packet, which \n   means the data is transported,
    in the clear, along with a signature \n   based on the data itself.  These mechanisms
    rely on the manual \n   configuration of the keys used to seed, or build, these
    hash based \n   signatures.  This document outlines some of the problems with
    manual \n   keying of these cryptographic algorithms.\n\t </p>\n      "
