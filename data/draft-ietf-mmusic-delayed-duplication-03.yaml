abstract:
- content: <p>A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet losses
    due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units is to duplicate
    the original packets and send each copy separated in time by at least T time units.
    This approach is commonly referred to as "time-shifted redundancy", "temporal
    redundancy", or simply "delayed duplication". This document defines an attribute
    to indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the duplication
    delay in the Session Description Protocol.</p>
