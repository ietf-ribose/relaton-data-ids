abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to add new named
    attributes to be used in the protocol to provide information about the data reduction
    properties of files. The new data reduction attributes are proposed to allow the
    client application to communicate to the NFSv4 server data reduction attributes
    associated with files and directories using new metadata, communicated to the
    Block Storage data reduction engines. Corresponding new named attributes are proposed
    to allow clients and client applications to query the server for data reduction
    attributes support and allow to get and set data reduction attributes on files
    and directories. Such data reduction metadata is used as hints to the file server
    about what type of data reduction to apply. The proposed data reduction attributes
    include achievable ratios for compression and deduplication plus whether each
    data reduction technique applies to a file or directory.</p>"
