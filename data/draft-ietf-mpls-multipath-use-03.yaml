abstract:
- content: "<p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many
    MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth
    applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged
    the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot
    be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations. Using
    MPLS Entropy label, MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be carried over multipath
    links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP
    LSPs. This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for
    MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.</p>"
