abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification creates a new IANA registry, \"SIP Feature
    Cap\n   Registry\", which is used to register indicators, \"SIP feature caps\",\n
    \  used by SIP entities to indicate support of features and\n   capabilities,
    in cases where the Contact header field contains a URI\n   that does not represent
    the SIP entity that wants to indicate support\n   of its features and capabilities.\n\n
    \  This specification also defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps,\n   that
    can be used by SIP entities to convey information about\n   supported features
    and capabilities, using SIP feature caps.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
