abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the \"Semantic Addressing
    and\n   Routing for Future Networks\" workshop (SARNET-21), which took place\n
    \  on June 10, 2021, in Paris, France and online as part of the IEEE\n   International
    Conference on High-Performance Switching and Routing.\n   The main goal of the
    SARNET-21 workshop was to explore, together with\n   the research community, the
    use cases and network requirements in the\n   domain of semantic addressing and
    routing, and identify potential\n   research challenges to be tackled in the future.\n\n
    \  Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\n   SARNET-21
    workshop compiled by the authors.  It captures the views\n   and positions of
    the workshop participants as expressed during the\n   workshop.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
