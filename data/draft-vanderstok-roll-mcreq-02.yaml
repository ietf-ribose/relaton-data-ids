abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a working document intended to focus discussion on requirements
    for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the area of M2M communication
    for control applications. The Trickle algorithm, which uses random re-broadcasting
    to assure that messages arrive at all destinations, has been proposed in the Trickle
    Multicast Forwarding ROLL WG draft as the basis for a multicast routing protocol.
    In this draft additional requirements on multicast routing are presented, such
    as timeliness, motivated by building control. Random re-broadcasting and timeliness
    can be difficult to reconcile. This draft presents some simulation results in
    typical control settings which show that achieving latencies below 400 ms is feasible
    with Trickle. Recommendations are proposed for the current Trickle Multicast Forwarding
    draft to achieve optimal performance and meet the stated requirements.</p>"
