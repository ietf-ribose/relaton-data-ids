abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features basedon
    our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality beingdefined as part
    of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within ourexisting deployed MPLS networks.This
    document is not intended to describe all future requirements forMPLS-TP features,
    only for those features that we have a currentlydefined requirement for today
    and which we would like to see prioritybe given to them when specifying and standardising
    MPLS-TP withinIETF. These features are required in order to enable us to enhancelive,
    revenue generating services.</p>"
