abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies a minimum set of standards and requirements\n
    \  that must be supported by a Video Relay Service (VRS) Video Access\n   Technology
    Reference Platform (VATRP)-compliant client and United\n   States Telecommunications
    Relay Service providers required to be\n   VATRP compliant.  This Relay User Equipment
    specification only\n   specifies a minimum set of requirements.  It does not prohibit
    VRS\n   providers or endpoint developers from developing or deploying\n   additional
    capabilities, provided that doing so will not prevent\n   compliance with the
    requirements specified here.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
