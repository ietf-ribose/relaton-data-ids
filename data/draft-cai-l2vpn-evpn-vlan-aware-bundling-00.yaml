abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies E-VPN extensions to support the new VLAN aware
    bundling service interface type defined in [EVPN-REQ]. The new service interface
    type provides advantages in reducing provisioning overhead as well as E-VPN instances
    scale in environments where a large number of VLANs need to be extended over an
    MPLS/IP network, while maintaining traffic segregation among those VLANs. The
    VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale requirements of
    today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over a single WAN E-VPN instance
    used to interconnect those Data Center sites.</p>"
