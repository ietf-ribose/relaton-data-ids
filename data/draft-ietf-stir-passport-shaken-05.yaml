abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys
    cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved in communications.
    The extension is defined, corresponding to the SHAKEN specification, to provide
    both a specific set of levels-of- confidence to the correctness of the originating
    identity for a SIP based Communication Service Provider (CSP) telephone network
    originated call as well as an identifier that allows the CSP to uniquely identify
    the origination of the call within its network.</p>"
