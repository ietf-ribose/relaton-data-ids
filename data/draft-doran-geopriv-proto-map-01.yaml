abstract:
  content: "<p>There are currently several protocols developed by differentstandards
    organizations that implement a basic design pattern where aclient requests location
    from a location server and the serverresponds with location information. This
    document defines the CommonLocation Interoperability Framework (CLIF), a general
    data model forsuch protocols, and describes how some existing geolocation protocolscan
    be mapped into this unified model.</p>"
