abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information. This document updates RFC 4861 to allow routers to proactively
    create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It
    also updates RFC 4861 and recommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements
    upon assigning a new IPv6 address. These changes will minimize the delay and packet
    loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link destination from a new IPv6
    address.</p>"
