abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two YANG modules that augment the Interfaces data
    model defined in the "YANG Data Model for Interface Management" with additional
    configuration and operational data nodes to support common lower layer interface
    properties, such as interface MTU. These properties are common to many types of
    interfaces on network routers and switches and are implemented by multiple network
    equipment vendors with similar semantics, even though some of the features are
    not formally defined in any published standard.</p>
