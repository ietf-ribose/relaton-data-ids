abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to enable HTTP Clients
    to provide\n   an indication within a HTTP Connect request as to which protocol
    will\n   be used within the tunnel established to the Server identified by the\n
    \  target resource.  The tunneled protocol is declared using the Tunnel-\n   Protocol
    HTTP Request header field.  Label usage relating to the use\n   of HTTP Connect
    by WebRTC clients (e.g. turn, webrtc) are described\n   in this document.\n\n\t
