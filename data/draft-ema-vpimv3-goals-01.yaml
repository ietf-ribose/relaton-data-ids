abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the goals of Voice Profile for Internet Mail
    (VPIM), Version 3 and establishes a baseline of desired functionality against
    which proposed MIME profiles for Internet voice messaging can be judged. The primary
    goal for this version is to support interoperability with desktop clients. Other
    goals for this version of VPIM include backward compatibility, expanded interoperability
    with unified messaging systems, and conformance to Internet standards. This document
    does not include goals that were met fully by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2]. Different
    levels of desirability are indicated throughout the document.</p>"
