abstract:
- content: "<p>One desirable application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
    is to detect a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP)
    data plane failure. LSP Ping is an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data
    plane failures and for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.
    BFD can be used for the former, but not for the latter. However, the control plane
    processing required for BFD Control packets is relatively smaller than the processing
    required for LSP Ping messages. A combination of LSP Ping and BFD can be used
    to provide faster data plane failure detection and/or make it possible to provide
    such detection on a greater number of LSPs. This document describes the applicability
    of BFD in relation to LSP Ping for this application. It also describes procedures
    for using BFD in this environment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
