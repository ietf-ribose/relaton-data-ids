abstract:
- content: "<p>This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one transitive
    and one non-transitive. It also defines two IANA registries in order to allow
    the allocation of reserved transitive and non-transitive extended communities.
    These are similar to the existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities
    defined in RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community advertissement
    as a community could be chosen as transitive or non- transitive across ASes.</p>"
