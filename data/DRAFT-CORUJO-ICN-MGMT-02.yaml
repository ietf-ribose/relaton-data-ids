abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Motivated by the need to find and evaluate better ways for
    reaching\n   on-line content in upcoming Future Internet environments, ICN has\n
    \  been increasingly deployed in an broad range of research and\n   experimental
    actions.  Some deployments even go as far as subjecting\n   ICN to new scenarios
    beyond content-reaching, exposing the\n   flexibility of ICN core primitives in
    supporting such mechanisms.  In\n   this sense, besides analyzing and discussing
    the role of network\n   management procedures in ICN environments, this document
    also\n   analyzes possibilities on how intrinsic core ICN mechanisms can be\n
    \  reutilized for network management.  We consider that the availability\n   of
    management mechanisms for ICN will foster their deployment and, as\n   such, should
    be tackled still in the design and experimentation\n   phases.  Perhaps ICN can
    adapt successful mechanisms from the host-\n   centric paradigm, or new network
    management schemes can be designed.\n   Perhaps even both.  This document centralizes
    that discussion,\n   drawing the attention of the ICNRG community to this underdeveloped\n
    \  area of research in ICN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
