abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for
    anadministrative domain to be able to actively revoke a current MobileIP registration
    was recognized. Due to the lack of a specificscenario requiring such a mechanism,
    it was decided that a passivemechanism, namely short registration lifetimes, and
    the denial of asubsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for thispurpose.</p>"
