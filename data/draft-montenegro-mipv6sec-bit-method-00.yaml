abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 uses 'return routability' to secure route optimization.
    Even after using this procedure, there are residual threats for which other stronger
    methods provide protection. Since these are optional, and return routability is
    the default, an attacker may engage in 'bidding down' attacks. These attacks aim
    at coercing participants in Mobile IPv6 route optimization to forgo the stronger
    methods for the default return routability. This document discusses what the participants
    in route optimization can do to deter or alleviate bidding down attacks: the 'step
    down' procedure for the mobile node and the 'bit method' at the correspondent
    node.</p>"
