abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document is an attempt to classify different types of
    node in\n   peer-to-peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP).  Four possible\n
    \  types of nodes in P2PSIP are discussed based on two characters:\n   whether
    it offers overlay-routing services and whether it offers\n   storage functions.
    \ The behaviors of each type of nodes and their\n   possible necessities are analyzed.
    \ This document is dedicated to be\n   a reference for clarifying some controversial
    terms in P2PSIP working\n   group, such as \"client\", \"low-function peer\",
    etc.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
