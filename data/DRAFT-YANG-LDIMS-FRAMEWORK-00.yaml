abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network is now developing into large-scale and speedup, meanwhile,\n
    \  intrusion methods become more and more complicated.  In this network \n   environment,
    traditional IDSs can¡¯t insure the security of the \n   protected systems.  IMS
    is the trend of IDSs evolution.  IMS is a \n   system that combines intrusion
    detection with urgent response.  \n   In IMS, IDSs associate with other security
    components, such as \n   Firewalls, Vulnerability Scanning Systems, Virus Prevention
    Systems \n   and network Management Systems.\n   \n   This document describes
    a hierarchy framework for Large-scale \n   Distributed Intrusion Management System
    (LDIMS), with which a \n   Large-scale Distributed IMS can be flexibly deployed.
    layered nodes \n   constitute this framework.  Each node is a simple IMS.  This
    document \n   gives a four-layer structure for the simple IMS, the four-layer
    \n   structure can also be the structure of an independent IMS. \n\t </p>\n      "
