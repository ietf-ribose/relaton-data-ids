abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a technique to improve DNS privacy,
    a\n   technique called \"QNAME minimisation\", where the DNS resolver no\n   longer
    sends the full original QNAME to the upstream name server.\n\n   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE
    REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION.  The original [RFC7816]\n   had the experimental status.
    \ This document is intended for the\n   standards track.  It should be discussed
    in the IETF DNSOP (DNS\n   Operations) Working Group, through its mailing list.
    \ The source of\n   the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
    kept at\n   Framagit [1].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
