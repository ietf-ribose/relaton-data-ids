abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document considers the problem of service identification
    in the\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Service identification is the\nprocess
    of determining the user-level use case that is driving the\nsignaling being utilized
    by the user agent.  While seemingly simple,\nthis process is quite complex, and
    when not addressed properly, can\nlead to fraud, interoperability problems, and
    stifling of innovation.\nThis document discusses these problems and makes recommendations
    on\nhow to address them.\n\t </p>\n      "
