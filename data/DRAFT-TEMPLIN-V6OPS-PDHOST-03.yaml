abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream-\n   attached
    hosts and the upstream Internetwork, and can also act as a\n   host under the
    weak end system model.  This document considers the\n   case when the \"requesting
    router\" is actually a simple host which\n   receives a delegated prefix that
    it can use solely for its own\n   internal multi-addressing purposes under the
    strong end system model.\n   This method can be applied in a wide variety of use
    cases to allow\n   ample address availability without impacting link performance.\n\n\t
