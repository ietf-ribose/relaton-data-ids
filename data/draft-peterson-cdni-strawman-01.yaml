abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a simple strawman for CDN interconnection, and
    uses the strawman as a basis for articulating a set of design principles and exploring
    (parts of) the CDNI design space. Our intent is to spur discussion about what
    information needs to be exchanged between CDN peers, which is a prerequisite for
    crafting interfaces and protocols to communicate that information.</p>"
