abstract:
  content: "<p>The HTTP 1.1 specification describes how a server can answer arequest
    with a redirection, instructing the client to get theresource from a different
    URL. It doesn't explain what to do with anyfragment identifier that might have
    been on the original URL, andthis omission has resulted in different clients handling
    fragments indifferent ways. This draft gives rules towards a more consistenthandling
    by future HTTP clients.</p>"
