abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP 1.1 specification describes how a server can answer a request
    with a redirection, instructing the client to get the resource from a different
    URL. It doesn't explain what to do with any fragment identifier that might have
    been on the original URL, and this omission has resulted in different clients
    handling fragments in different ways. This draft gives rules towards a more consistent
    handling by future HTTP clients.</p>"
