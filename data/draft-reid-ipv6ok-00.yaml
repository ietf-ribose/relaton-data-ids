abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In order to simplify the deployment of AAAA records in the DNS,
    nameservers should only perform automatic inclusion of these RRs whenthere is
    an explicit indication that the resolver can understandthose RRs. This document
    proposes the use of a bit in the EDNS0 headerto provide that explicit indication
    and describes the necessary protocolchanges to implement that notification.</p>"
