abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Traditionally
    this TED has been obtained from a link state routing protocol supporting traffic
    engineering extensions. This document discusses possible alternatives and enhancements
    to the existing approach to TED creation. This document gives architectural alternatives
    for these alternatives and their potential impacts on network nodes, routing protocols,
    and PCEP.</p>"
