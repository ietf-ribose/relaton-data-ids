abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal
    techniques that were considered to be used for establishing the RTP media flows
    controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). Each technique includes
    a description on how it would be used, the security implications of using it and
    any other deployment considerations it has. There are also discussions on how
    NAT traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can be applied
    in different use cases. These findings where used when selecting the NAT traversal
    for RTSP 2.0.</p>"
