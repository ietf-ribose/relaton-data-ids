abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax RFC 8152 does
    not define any direct methods for using hash algorithms. There are however circumstances
    where hash algorithms are used: Indirect signatures, where the hash of one or
    more external contents are signed, or thumbprints, for identification of X.509
    certificates or other objects. This document defines a set of hash algorithms
    that are identified by COSE Algorithm Identifiers.</p>"
