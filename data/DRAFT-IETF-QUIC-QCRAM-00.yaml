abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The design of the core QUIC transport subsumes many HTTP/2
    features,\n   prominent among them stream multiplexing.  A key advantage of the\n
    \  QUIC transport is stream multiplexing free of head-of-line (HoL)\n   blocking
    between streams.  In HTTP/2, multiplexed streams can suffer\n   HoL blocking due
    to TCP.\n\n   If HTTP/2's HPACK is used for header compression, HTTP/QUIC is still\n
    \  vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of HPACK's assumption of in-order\n   delivery.
    \ This draft defines QCRAM, a variation of HPACK and\n   mechanisms in the HTTP/QUIC
    mapping that allow the flexibility to\n   avoid header-compression-induced HoL
    blocking.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
