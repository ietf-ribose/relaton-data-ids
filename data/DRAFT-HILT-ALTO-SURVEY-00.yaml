abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated
    by\npeer-to-peer (P2P) applications used traditionally for file-sharing,\nand
    more recently for real-time communications and live media\nstreaming.  Such applications
    discover a route to each other through\nan overlay network with little knowledge
    of the underlying network\ntopology.  As a result, they may choose peers based
    on information\ndeduced from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal\nchoices.
    \ We refer to this as the Application Layer Traffic\nOptimization (ALTO) problem.
    \ In this draft we present a survey of\nexisting literature on discovering topology
    characteristics.\n\t </p>\n      "
