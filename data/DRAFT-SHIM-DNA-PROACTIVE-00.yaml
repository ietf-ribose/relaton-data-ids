abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose a Proactive Approach for Detecting Network Attachment
    \n(DNA). In the approach, the mobile node caches information about \nadjacent
    access points and access routers using the Candidate Access \nRouter Protocol
    and uses the cached information to check the new \nsubnet after the mobile node
    establishes a new air link. This enables \nthe mobile node to determine immediately
    after the new link setup \nwhether the mobile node needs to proceed further for
    new IP \nconfiguration for the link. \n\t </p>\n      "
