abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment
    list, one\n   or partial segments of the list cannot uniquely identify the SR
    path.\n   Path identification is a pre-requisite for various use-cases such as\n
    \  performance measurement (PM) of an SR path.\n\n   This document defines a new
    type of segment that is referred to as\n   Path Segment, which is used to identify
    an SR path.  When used, it is\n   inserted at the ingress node of the SR path
    and immediately follows\n   the last segment of the SR path.  The Path Segment
    will not be popped\n   off until it reaches the egress node of the SR path.\n\n
    \  Path Segment can be used by the egress node to implement path\n   identification
    hence to support various use-cases including SR path\n   PM, end-to-end 1+1 SR
    path protection and bidirectional SR paths\n   correlation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
