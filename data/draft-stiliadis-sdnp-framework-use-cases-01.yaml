abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an application framework and associated use
    cases to help define the scope of the SDNP working group. The use cases start
    with an abstract representation of a multi-tier application and illustrate the
    composition of a network service that can meet the requirements of the particular
    application. The service composition process is split into several steps, including
    application requirement specification, network mapping, service binding, and policy
    control. We also provide examples of interactions between an SDNP controller and
    L2 and L3 control layer protocols in order to deliver the end-to-end service.
    Finally, as a derivate of that, an architecture framework for SDNP that meets
    these requirements is proposed.</p>"
