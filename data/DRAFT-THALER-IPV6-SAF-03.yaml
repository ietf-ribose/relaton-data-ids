abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are various recent proposals that would result in IPv6\ntranslation
    becoming permanent.  RFC 3424 discusses UNilateral Self-\nAddress Fixing (UNSAF)
    mechanisms which are required for applications\nto work with most translation
    schemes, points out a number of\nproblems with them, and requires an exit strategy
    for any UNSAF\nmechanism.  This document discusses an alternative to UNSAF\nmechanisms
    should IPv6 translation become permanent.\n\t </p>\n      "
