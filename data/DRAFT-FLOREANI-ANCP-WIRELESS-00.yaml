abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n       The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) has been developed
    primarily \n       for the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) environment, with varying
    line \n       conditions where the system that uses ANCP consists of DSLAMs (DSL
    \n       access multiplexers) and terminal equipment.  In this scenario, the \n
    \      channel conditions on subscriber lines vary, forcing changes and \n       adaptations
    in line rates at the modem equipment, and affecting \n       services offered.
    \ Satellite communications service providers have \n       very similar issues
    and are also based around hubs, with satellite \n       terminals.  This application
    of ANCP could also be extended to point-\n       to-point radio services in both
    the satellite and terrestrial domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
