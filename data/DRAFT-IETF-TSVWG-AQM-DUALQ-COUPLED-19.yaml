abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active
    Queue\n   Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with\n
    \  different responses to congestion.  This provides a way for the\n   Internet
    to transition from the scaling problems of standard TCP\n   Reno-friendly ('Classic')
    congestion controls to the family of\n   'Scalable' congestion controls.  These
    are designed for consistently\n   very Low queuing Latency, very Low congestion
    Loss and Scaling of\n   per-flow throughput (L4S) by using Explicit Congestion
    Notification\n   (ECN) in a modified way.  Until the Coupled DualQ, these L4S
    senders\n   could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be\n
    \  arranged, such as in private data centres.  The coupling acts like a\n   semi-permeable
    membrane: isolating the sub-millisecond average\n   queuing delay and zero congestion
    loss of L4S from Classic latency\n   and loss; but pooling the capacity between
    any combination of\n   Scalable and Classic flows with roughly equivalent throughput
    per\n   flow.  The DualQ achieves this indirectly, without having to inspect\n
    \  transport layer flow identifiers and without compromising the\n   performance
    of the Classic traffic, relative to a single queue.  The\n   DualQ design has
    low complexity and requires no configuration for the\n   public Internet.\n\n\t
