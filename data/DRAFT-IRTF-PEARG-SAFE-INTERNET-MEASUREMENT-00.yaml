abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Researchers from industry and academia often use Internet\n
    \  measurements as part of their work.  While these measurements can\n   give
    insight into the functioning and usage of the Internet, they can\n   come at the
    cost of user privacy.  This document describes guidelines\n   for ensuring that
    such measurements can be carried out safely.\n\nNote\n\n   Comments are solicited
    and should be addressed to the research\n   group's mailing list at pearg@irtf.org
    and/or the author(s).\n\n   The sources for this draft are at:\n\n   https://github.com/irl/draft-safe-internet-measurement\n\n\t
