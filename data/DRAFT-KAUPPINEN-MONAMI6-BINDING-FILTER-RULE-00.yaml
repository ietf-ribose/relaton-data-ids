abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile nodes using more than one interface for communicating
    with\n   other nodes in the network need a mechanism that controls how these\n
    \  interfaces are used.  One way of controlling the interface usage is\n   to
    define rules that map flows to network interfaces.  These rules\n   can also be
    called filter rules that are bound to Filter Interface\n   Identifiers.\n\n   This
    document describes a mechanism to associate Filter Interface\n   Identifiers with
    the current location information of a mobile node in\n   case when the mobility
    protocol used by the mobile node is Mobile\n   IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
