abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP), a method
    for\n   application layer protection of message exchanges with the\n   Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), using the CBOR Object\n   Signing and Encryption
    (COSE) format.  OSCOAP provides end-to-end\n   encryption, integrity and replay
    protection to CoAP payload, options,\n   and header fields, as well as a secure
    binding between CoAP request\n   and response messages.  The use of OSCOAP is
    signaled with the CoAP\n   option Object-Security, also defined in this memo.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
