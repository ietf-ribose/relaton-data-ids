abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>VoIP over MPLS typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS.
    \ \nFor an MPLS VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice \npayload
    is typically no more than 30 bytes.  VoIP over MPLS header \ncompression can significantly
    reduce the VoIP overhead through various \ncompression mechanisms.  This is important
    on access links where \nbandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone
    facilities, \nespecially where costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections).
    \ In \nthis draft we propose to use RSVP extensions to signal the header \ncompression
    context and other control messages between the ingress and \negress LSR.  We provide
    two approaches to determining the header \ncompression context: a) re-use the
    methods in cRTP to determine the \ncontext, and b) re-use the methods in Swallow's
    and Berger's 'simple' \napproach to determine the context.\n\t </p>\n      "
