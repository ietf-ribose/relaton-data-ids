abstract:
  content: "<p>In the existing TCP, only one local and one remote address is usedthrough
    a TCP session, even when a client or a server is locatedunder multi-homed site
    and has multiple IP addresses. When a networkoutage occurs and the access-line
    associated with the local andremote addresses is down, the TCP session itself
    gets lost even ifanother access-line is alive. TCP MH option makes it possible
    tohandle multiple local and remote address pairs in one TCP session andto survive
    network outages by finding out an alternative networkpath. Our path transition
    mechanism is simple, fast, lightweight andas secure as existing TCP.</p>"
