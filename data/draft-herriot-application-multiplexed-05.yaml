abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type, like theMultipart/Related
    content-type, provides a mechanism for representingobjects that consist of multiple
    components. An Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity contains a sequence of chunks.
    Each chunk containsa MIME message or a part of a MIME message. Each MIME messagerepresents
    a component of the compound object, just as a body part ofa Multipart/Related
    entity represents a component. With aMultipart/Related entity, a body part and
    its reference in some otherbody part may be separated by many octets. With anApplication/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed
    entity, a message and its referencein some other message can be made quite close
    by chunking the messagecontaining the reference. For example, if a long message
    containsreferences to images and the producer does not know of the need foreach
    image until it generates the reference, thenApplication/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed allows
    the consumer to process thereference to the image and the image before it consumes
    the entirelong message. This ability is important in printing and scanningapplications.
    This document defines the Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type. It also
    provides examples of its use.</p>"
