- content: "<p>This document defines a simple protocol for retrieving metadata about
    named entities, or named collections of entities. The goal of the protocol is
    to profile various aspects of HTTP to allow requesters to rely on certain, rigorously
    defined, behaviour. This document is a product of the Research and Education Federations
    (REFEDS) Working Group process.</p>"
