abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Memo defines the SKiCal format.\nSKiCal is a machine-readable
    format for the interchange of enhanced\nyellow-page directory listings.  SkiCal
    expands the traditional\nproperty-set of name, address, telephone number and business\ncategory,
    \ adding structured information about people, places,\nthings, activities  and
    the conditions and terms for interaction with\nresources.SkiCal provides a structure
    for information about dates\nand times, directions, rules and recommendations
    for participation,\npricing and reservation schemes, access information for those
    with\nspecial needs, ownership and responsibilities and promotional\nmaterial.
    \ The referents of these listings, which are both events and\npersistent resources
    are referred to in this draft as SkiSources.\nSkiCal is based on and extends the
    iCalendar format as defined by\nRFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling
    Core Object\nSpecification [3] (iCalendar).  SkiCal objects are comprised of\neither
    VEVENT components with the addition of new properties and\nproperty parameters,
    or the SkiCal specific VOPTIME calendar\ncomponent described in this memo.\n\n\t
