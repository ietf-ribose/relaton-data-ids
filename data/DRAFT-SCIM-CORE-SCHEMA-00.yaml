abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) specification is
    designed\n   to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and\n
    \  services easier.  The specification suite builds upon experience with\n   existing
    schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on\n   simplicity of development
    and integration, while applying existing\n   authentication, authorization, and
    privacy models.  Its intent is to\n   reduce the cost and complexity of user management
    operations by\n   providing a common user schema and extension model, as well
    as\n   binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema\n   using
    standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy\n   to move identity
    in to, out of, and around the cloud.\n\n   This document provides a platform neutral
    schema and extension model\n   for representing users and groups in JSON and XML
    formats.  This\n   schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service
    providers.\n   Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML\n
    \  binding, and use cases.\n\t </p>\n      "
