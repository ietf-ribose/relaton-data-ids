abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has been a popular choice
    as the\n   message encoding for many network protocols.  Meanwhile, there are\n
    \  broad interests in the networking community to use the YANG data\n   modeling
    language [RFC6020] to define data store and protocol\n   messages, so that one
    can use YANG related tools such as the\n   OpenDayLight Controller.  Although
    YANG itself is XML based, there\n   have been efforts to model JSON content using
    YANG\n   [draft-ietf-netmod-yang-json-01]\n\n   This document explores the conditions
    under which the messages of a\n   JSON based protocol can have a syntactically
    equivalent and hence\n   interoperable YANG model.  In particular, this document
    shows that\n   any JSON protocol message with stand-alone non-object JSON values,\n
    \  certain JSON arrays of elements of mixed types, or non-keyword keys\n   in
    key-value pairs cannot have a syntactically equivalent YANG model.\n   It also
    applies these conditions to the ALTO and CDNi protocol\n   messages as examples.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
