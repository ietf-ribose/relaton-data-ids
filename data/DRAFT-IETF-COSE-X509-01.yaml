  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure syntax
    uses\n   the COSE Key structure for placing keys in a message.  This document\n
    \  extends the way that keys can be identified and transported by\n   providing
    attributes that refer to or contain X.509 certificates.\n\nContributing to this
    document\n\n   The source for this draft is being maintained in GitHub.  Suggested\n
    \  changes should be submitted as pull requests at &lt;https://github.com/\n   cose-wg/X509&gt;.
    \ Instructions are on that page as well.  Editorial\n   changes can be managed
    in GitHub, but any substantial issues need to\n   be discussed on the COSE mailing
    list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
