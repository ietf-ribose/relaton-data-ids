abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
    environments such as call centers and financial trading. In some of these environments,
    all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection
    reasons. Recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a
    media stream to a recording device. This document describes the metadata model
    as viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS) and the Recording metadata format.</p>"
