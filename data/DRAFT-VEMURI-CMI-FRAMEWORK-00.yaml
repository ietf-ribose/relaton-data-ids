abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this paper we study the problem of call model integration.
    \ \nSeveral call models are in common use. Most are customized for \nefficiency
    of operation and ease of access to features within  \nspecific domains. Access
    to features external to a given domain may \nbe facilitated by overlaying the
    call model representation intrinsic \nto said external domain atop the base call
    model integral to the pre-\nspecified base domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
