abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is a follow-up of a University thesis which aims to measure
    the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic and to analyze the geographical distribution
    of IPv6 nodes. The first measurements were done during the Summer 2009 using a
    specific-purpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network
    and this document adds measurements done with the same program but in October
    2011 and February 2012. The study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because
    they are responsible for a big part of Internet traffic and because their structure
    and functioning permit a rapid discovery of a large number of nodes from all over
    the world. In addition, the P2P users are more likely to be interested by IPv6
    as IPv6 does not have the same NAT problems as IPv4.</p>"
