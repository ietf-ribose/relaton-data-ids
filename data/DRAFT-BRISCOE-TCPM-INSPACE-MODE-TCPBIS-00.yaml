abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental redesign of TCP's\n
    \  extensibility mechanism.  It aims to traverse most known middleboxes\n   including
    connection splitters, by making it possible to tunnel all\n   TCP options within
    the TCP Data.  It provides a choice between in-\n   order and out-of-order delivery
    for TCP options.  In-order delivery\n   is a useful new facility for options that
    control datastream\n   processing.  Out-of-order delivery has been the norm for
    TCP options\n   until now, and is necessary for options involved with acknowledging\n
    \  data, otherwise flow control can deadlock.  TCP's original design\n   limits
    TCP option space to 40B.  In the new design there is no such\n   arbitrary limit,
    other than the maximum size of a segment.  The TCP\n   client can immediately
    start to use the extra option space\n   optimistically from the very first SYN
    segment, by using a dual\n   handshake.  The dual handshake is designed to prevent
    a legacy server\n   from getting confused and sending the control options to the\n
    \  application as user-data.  The dual handshake is only one strategy -\n   a
    single handshake will usually suffice once deployment is underway.\n   In summary,
    the protocol should allow new TCP options to be\n   introduced i) with minimal
    middlebox traversal problems; ii) with\n   incremental deployment from legacy
    servers; iii) with zero\n   handshaking delay iv) with a choice of in-order and
    out-of-order\n   delivery v) without arbitrary limits on available space.\n\n\t
