  content: "\n\t <p>   This note identifies all of the places that cryptography is
    used in\n   Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architectures, to simplify the\n
    \  task of selecting the protocols, algorithms, and key sizes needed to\n   achieve
    a consistent security level across the entire architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
