abstract:
  content: <p>The proposed IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Optimization"Optimistic
    DAD" defines a set of recoverable procedures which allowa node to make use of
    an address before DAD completes. Essentially,Optimistic DAD forbids usage of certain
    Neighbour Discovery optionswhich could pollute active neighbour cache entries,
    while an addressis tentative.This document defines a new option and procedures
    to replace cachepolluting options, in a way which is useful to tentative nodes.These
    procedures are designed to be to backward compatible withexisting devices which
    support IPv6 Neighbour Discovery.</p>
