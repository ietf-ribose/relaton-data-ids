abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a REST interface based on the RATS architecture
    that can be used to retrieve attested system state, for example the reading of
    a security critical sensor. The objective is to present a common vocabulary of
    data formats and basic protocol transactions that can be pieced together into
    a cohesive interface that is capable of serving different attestation workflows.</p>"
