abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism to encode relevant
    data for\n   NS records (and optionally A and AAAA records) on the parental side\n
    \  of a zone cut, by encoding them in new DS algorithms.\n\n   Since DS records
    are signed by the parent, this creates a method for\n   validation of the otherwise
    unsigned delegation and glue records.\n\n   This is beneficial if the name server
    _names_ are in a DNSSEC signed\n   zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
