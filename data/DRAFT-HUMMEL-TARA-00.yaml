abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like to\ncall
    TARA = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primary\nobjective is to
    eliminate the so-called scalability problem as\nproclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming
    the true causes of this \nproblem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms
    - it may \nserve as the base for much better routing.\n\t </p>\n      "
