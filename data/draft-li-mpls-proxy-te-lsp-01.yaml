abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a method to setup MPLS TE proxy egress LSP
    which can help setup end-to-end LSP through stitching MPLS TE proxy egress LSP
    with BGP LSP in the Seamless MPLS network. The method is achieved by new Proxy
    Destination Object carried in RSVP-TE messages.</p>"
