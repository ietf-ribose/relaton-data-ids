abstract:
- content: "<p>If a Mobile Node communicates with different Corresponding Nodes and
    there exists a common path for these sessions, NSIS allows these reservations
    to be aggregated. However, change of aggregation path caused by mobility event
    creates problems related to the prompt removal of the old aggregation state in
    case Correspondent Nodes are NSIS Initiators, i.e. multiple Correspondent Nodes
    will send multiple teardown messages for tearing down the same unused aggregated
    section and may cause problems of extra signaling overhead, delay in tearing down,
    reliability, redundancy and extra processing overhead. This draft presents the
    analysis of these problems.</p>"
