abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths by encoding paths as sequences of sub-paths, called "segments". Segment
    routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an
    IPv6 data plane. Further, Path Segment has been defined in order to identify an
    SR path in SR-MPLS networks, and used for various use-cases such as end- to-end
    SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM) of an SR path. Similar to
    SR-MPLS, this document defines the Path Segment in SRv6 networks in order to identify
    an SRv6 path.</p>
