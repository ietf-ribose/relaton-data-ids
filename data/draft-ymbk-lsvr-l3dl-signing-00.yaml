abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer 3 Discovery and Liveness protocol OPEN PDU may contain a
    key and a certificate, which can be used to verify signatures on subsequent PDUs.
    This document describes two mechanisms based on digital signatures, one that is
    Trust On First Use (TOFU), and one that uses certificates to provide authentication
    as well as session integrity.</p>"
