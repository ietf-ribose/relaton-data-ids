abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new password-based protocol that can
    be\nused as the basis of mutual authentication, or downloading of a\nprivate key.
    The only thing the client needs to know is the user's\npassword. The protocol
    is constructed such that an eavesdropper\ncannot do off-line password-guessing
    attacks. Someone stealing the\nserver's database cannot directly impersonate the
    user, although they\ncan do an off-line password-guessing attack on the contents.
    The\nprotocol presented in this paper is similar in functionality, higher\nin
    performance at the server, but lower in performance at the client,\nto the extended
    EKE and SPEKE, and SRP schemes.  Additional\nproperties of this scheme are salt,
    no password-equivalent stored at\nthe server, and prevention of servers on which
    the user has the same\npassword from impersonating each other to the user. This
    document\ngives an overview of the approach, but not wire-formats, which are\npremature
    at this stage. The purpose of this document is to advertise\nthis new scheme to
    various groups that might be interested (CAT, for\na GSS-API mechanism, LDAP,
    for download of a private key).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
