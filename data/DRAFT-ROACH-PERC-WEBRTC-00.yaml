abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Privacy-Enhanced Realtime Conferencing (PERC) architecture\n
    \  defines a system by which multiparty conferences can be handled by a\n   conference
    server that is \"semi-trusted\": that is, it is trusted to\n   correctly handle
    media packets, but it is not trusted with the actual\n   contents of the media
    streams.  In order to use this architecture\n   within WebRTC, we must describe
    how information is conveyed among\n   various network functions.  This document
    describes the information\n   to be conveyed and how it is transferred.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
