abstract:
  content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roamand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting theongoing sessions that
    nodes of the network may have. By extendingthe Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers,
    nodes of the network arenot required to support any kind of mobility, since packets
    must gothrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel.Communications
    from/to a mobile network have to traverse the HomeAgent, and therefore better
    paths may be available. Additionally,this solution adds packet overhead, due to
    the encapsulation.This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation
    forNEMO, based on the well-known concept of Correspondent Router. Thesolution
    aims at meeting the currently identified NEMO RouteOptimisation requirements for
    Operational Use in Aeronautics andSpace Exploration. Based on the ideas that have
    been proposed in thepast, as well as some other extensions, this document describes
    aCorrespondent Router based solution, trying to identify the mostimportant open
    issues.The main goal of this first version of the document is to describe aninitial
    NEMO RO solution based on the deployment of CorrespondentRouters and trigger the
    discussion within the MEXT WG about this kindof solution.This document (in an
    appendix) also analyses how a CorrespondentRouter based solution fits each of
    the currently identified NEMORoute Optimisation requirements for Operational Use
    in Aeronauticsand Space Exploration.</p>"
