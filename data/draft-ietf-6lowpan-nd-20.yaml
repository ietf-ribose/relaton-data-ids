abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF 6LoWPAN work defines IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal
    Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4. This and other similar link technologies
    have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation. In
    addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept
    of IP subnets and IP links. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive
    wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy
    use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power
    and lossy network. This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery, its addressing mechanisms and duplicate address detection for Low-power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks. The document thus updates
    RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here.</p>"
