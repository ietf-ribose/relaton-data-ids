abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A generic YANG data model for Operations, Administration, and\n
    \  Maintenance (OAM) has been defined in [GENYANGOAM], with the\n   intention
    that technology-specific extensions will be developed to be\n   able reference/use
    the Generic YANG model.  In this document, we\n   describe the applicability of
    the generic YANG OAM data model to\n   specific OAM technologies.  To be concrete,
    we also demonstrate the\n   usability and extensibility of the generic YANG OAM
    model with OAM\n   protocols such as IP Ping, traceroute, BFD and MPLS LSP Ping.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
