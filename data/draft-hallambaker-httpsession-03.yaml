abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP Session Management Mechanism provides a mean of securely establishing
    a persistent authentication session between a HTTP client and server that does
    not rely on the presentation of a confidential bearer token. The Session Management
    Mechanism is intended to provide a replacement for the existing HTTP State Management
    Mechanism (Cookies) for this purpose. This document defines the HTTP Accept-Session,
    Set-Session and Session headers and specifies their use to establish symmetric
    authentication keys and their use to authenticate and verify specific parts of
    an HTTP message. Other means by which keys used to authenticate the messages are
    established are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
