abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is widely deployed at TLD
    and other\n   important domain names currently.  DNSSEC is an effective method
    to\n   provide security protection for end users in the network.  DNSSEC\n   needs
    a lot of operations to maintain the chain of trust, like DNSKEY\n   rollover operations
    periodically.  But the chain of trust could be\n   broken if the operator of domain
    replaces the old key immediately in\n   a emergency rollover operation when the
    key is compromised.  The\n   break will make the domain and his sub-domains invisible
    in a short\n   time if the data in the cache of resolver is right, on the contrary,\n
    \  the fake RR in the cache of resolver may be \"valid\" if the resolver\n   is
    under the attack from hackers.  This document introduces the\n   compromised-key
    digest signature (CKDS) resource record to mitigate\n   the impact of invalidation
    which is due to emergency rollover from\n   the authoritative name server.\n\n\t
