abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique\n
    \ IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID\n  is
    128 bits long, and if generated according to the one of the\n  mechanisms in this
    document, is either guaranteed to be different\n  from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated
    until 3400 A.D. or extremely\n  likely to be different (depending on the mechanism
    chosen). UUIDs\n  were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) [1]
    and\n  later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing\n  Environment
    [2].\n \n  This specification is derived from the latter specification with the\n
    \ kind permission of the OSF.\n\t </p>\n      "
