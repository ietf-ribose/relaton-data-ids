abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a human-readable, textual syntax for\n
    \  representing self-describing structured data. This representation was\n   designed
    as a transfer syntax for loosely-coupled distributed\n   applications where one
    cannot depend on sender(s) and receiver(s)\n   sharing a schema for exchanged
    data. The syntax is compact,\n   expressive, intuitive, and simple to implement.\n\t
