abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document I am providing the outlines for a modified
    version\n   of the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS); the modified version\n
    \  will come as a new protocol that will build a secured tunnel between\n   the
    client and the server without the need to involve Certificate\n   Authorities
    or any other third party in this process; it is called\n   User Defined Key Pair
    protocol(UDKP), and is based on the assumption\n   that in most cases there is
    a registered profile for the user on the\n   server; a profile that includes among
    a lot of things the username\n   and the password that the user uses to authenticate
    to the server,\n   the proposed protocol will make use of the username and the
    password\n   to create a key pair for the user on the fly at the client side,
    and\n   it will use this key pair as the starting point for creating the\n   secured
    tunnel instead of taking the server certificate as the\n   starting point. Additionally
    the proposed protocol has self-\n   protection against phishing attacks.\n\n\n\t
