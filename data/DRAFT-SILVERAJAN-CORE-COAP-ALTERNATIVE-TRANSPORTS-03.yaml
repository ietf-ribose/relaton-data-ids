abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and\n   transmitted
    using UDP.  This draft examines the requirements and\n   possible solutions for
    conveying CoAP packets to end points over\n   alternative transports to UDP.  UDP
    remains the optimal solution for\n   CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments
    and nodes.  However the\n   need for M2M communication using non-IP networks,
    improved transport\n   level end-to-end reliability and security, NAT and firewall
    traversal\n   issues, and mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/\n
    \  HTTP translation gateways provide compelling motivation for\n   understanding
    how CoAP can operate in various other environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
