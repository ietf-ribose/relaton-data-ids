abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding\n
    \  architecture which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol\n   and
    doesn't require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast\n   state.  BIER
    is applicable in a multi-tenant data center network\n   environment for efficient
    delivery of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and\n   Multicast (BUM) traffic while eliminating
    the need for maintaining a\n   huge amount of multicast state in the underlay.
    \ This document\n   describes BGP extensions for advertising the BIER-specific\n
    \  information.  These extensions are applicable in those multi-tenant\n   data
    centers where BGP instead of IGP is deployed as an underlay for\n   network reachability
    advertisement.  These extensions may also be\n   applicable in other scenarios.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
