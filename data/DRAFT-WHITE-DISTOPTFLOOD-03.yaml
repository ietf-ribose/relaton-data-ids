abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In dense topologies, such as data center fabrics based on the
    Clos\n   and butterfly fabric topologies, flooding mechanisms designed for\n   sparse
    topologies, when used in these dense topologies, can\n   \"overflood,\" or carry
    too many copies of topology and reachability to\n   fabric devices.  This results
    in slower convergence times and higher\n   resource utilization.  The modifications
    to the flooding mechanism in\n   the Intermediate System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) link state\n   protocol described in this document reduce resource utilization
    to a\n   minimum, while increaseing convergence performance in dense\n   topologies.\n\n
    \  Note that a Clos fabric is used as the primary example of a desne\n   flooding
    topology throughout this document.  However, the flooding\n   optimizations described
    in this document apply to any dense topology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
