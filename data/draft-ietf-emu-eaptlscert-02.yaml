abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-TLS and other TLS-based EAP methods are widely deployed and used
    for network access authentication. Large certificates and long certificate chains
    combined with authenticators that drop an EAP session after only 40 - 50 round-trips
    is a major deployment problem. This memo looks at the this problem in detail and
    describes the potential solutions available.</p>"
