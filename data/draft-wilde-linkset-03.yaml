abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines two media types and a link relation type
    for sets of links. The media types can be used to represents links in a standalone
    fashion, in one case in the native format used in the HTTP Link header, and in
    the other case in a JSON-based format. The link relation can be used to reference
    these kind of standalone link sets, so that a resource can indicate that additional
    links putting it into context are available someplace else. One typical scenario
    is when the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header field becomes too big,
    and thus these links should be provided by a distinct resource.</p>"
