abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document illustrates some use cases and associated problems\n
    \  related to delivery of HTTPS secured traffic in the context of\n   interconnected
    CDNs.  A common scenario is when a uCDN is delegating\n   the delivery of encrypted
    traffic to a dCDN using HTTP or DNS\n   redirection.  Some potential solutions
    are considered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
