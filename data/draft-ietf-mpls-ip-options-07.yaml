abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how Label Edge Routers (LERs) should behave
    when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPv4 packet with header options.
    Lack of a formal standard has resulted in different LER forwarding behaviors for
    IPv4 packets with header options despite being associated with a prefix-based
    Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based
    FEC, yet are forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network without being MPLS- encapsulated,
    present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure. Further, LERs that are
    unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header options cannot operate in
    certain MPLS environments. While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory
    to implement, it is optional to invoke. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
