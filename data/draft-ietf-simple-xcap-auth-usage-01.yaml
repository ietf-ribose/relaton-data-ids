abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes three usages of the Extensible MarkupLanguage
    (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) that allow aclient to provide authorization
    decisions regarding watchers of theirpresence. The first of these usages, called
    permission-statements,contains statements about what permissions are to be granted
    towatchers of presence. The second of these usages, calledcompound-permissions,
    allows a client to define new permissions ascombinations of other defined permissions.
    The third usage, calledsupported-permissions, allows a client to determine what
    permissionsare understood by the provider.</p>"
