abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] toallow
    mobility management for the interface between a radio networkand a packet data
    network in the third generation cdma2000 network.Mobile IP requires link layer
    connectivity between the Mobile Nodeand the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes
    a protocol for achievingthis when the physical layer terminating at a point distant
    from theFA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks wherethe
    physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and theFA resides inside
    a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). ThePDSN is responsible for establishing,
    maintaining, and terminatingthe link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible
    for relayingthe link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its correspondingPDSN.The
    interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RPinterface. This interface
    requires mobility management for handlinghandoff from one RNN to another without
    interrupting end to endcommunication. It also requires the support of the link
    layerprotocol encapsulation.</p>"
