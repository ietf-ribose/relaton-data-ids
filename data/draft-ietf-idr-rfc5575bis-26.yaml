abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
    Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute traffic
    Flow Specifications. This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding
    more specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination
    prefix. It also specifies BGP Extended Community encoding formats, that can be
    used to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions along with the Flow Specification
    NLRI. Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode actions a routing system can take
    if the packet matches the Flow Specification. Additionally, it defines two applications
    of that encoding format: one that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination
    of traffic filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed)
    denial-of-service attacks, and a second application to provide traffic filtering
    in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service. Other applications (e.g. centralized
    control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context) are also possible. Other documents
    may specify Flow Specification extensions. The information is carried via BGP,
    thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience, and administrative
    processes such as inter-provider peering agreements. This document obsoletes both
    RFC5575 and RFC7674.</p>"
