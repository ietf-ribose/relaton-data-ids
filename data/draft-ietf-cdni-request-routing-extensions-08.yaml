abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). This document defines extensions to the CDNI Metadata Interface (MI)
    and the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). These extensions
    are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to
    CDNI use cases in general.</p>"
