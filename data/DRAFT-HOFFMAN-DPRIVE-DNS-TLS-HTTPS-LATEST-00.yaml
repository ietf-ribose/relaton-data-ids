abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals\n
    \  important information about the person who caused the queries, and it\n   would
    be better if eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic.\n   This document describes
    how to use TLS for encrypting DNS traffic\n   between a system acting as a DNS
    stub resolver and a system acting as\n   a DNS recursive resolver.  It defines
    how to easily wrap DNS queries\n   in HTTP requests and interpret DNS responses
    in the HTTP respones;\n   the HTTP here is always run under TLS on port 443.\n\n
    \  Discussion of this draft should take place in the DPRIVE WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
