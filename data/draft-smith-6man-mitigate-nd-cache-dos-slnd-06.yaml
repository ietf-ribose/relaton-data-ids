abstract:
- content: <p>One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover whether
    a specified neighbor is present. During the neighbor presence discovery process
    state is created. A node's capacity for this state can be intentionally exhausted
    to perform a denial of service attack, known as the "Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack".
    This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor presence discovery to prevent
    this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.</p>
