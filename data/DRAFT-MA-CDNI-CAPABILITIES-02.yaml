abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)
    is\n   predicated on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-\n   user
    requests in a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN\n   (uCDN).  The
    uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to\n   handle individual requests.
    \ The CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities\n   Advertisement interface (FCI) is provided
    for the advertisement of\n   capabilities and the footprints to which they apply
    by the dCDN to\n   the uCDN.  This document describes an approach to implementing
    the\n   CDNI FCI.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
