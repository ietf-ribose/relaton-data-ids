abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document considers the new use cases for IP together with
    the\n   network capabilities and services that will be needed to address\n   those
    use cases.  It then looks at the underlying packet requirements\n   and considers
    the changing deployment models and the issues with\n   existing packet designs
    that need to be addressed.  It concludes by\n   looking at some parameters of
    a solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
