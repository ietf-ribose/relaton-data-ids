abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the SPNEGO Extended Negotiation (NEGOEX)\nSecurity
    Mechanism.  NEGOEX enhances the capabilities of SPNEGO by\nproviding a security
    mechanism which can be negotiated by the SPNEGO\nprotocol as defined in RFC4178.\n\nThe
    NEGOEX protocol itself is a security mechanism negotiated by\nSPNEGO.  When the
    NEGOEX security mechanism is selected by SPNEGO,\nNEGOEX provides a method allowing
    selection of a common\nauthentication protocol based on factors beyond just the
    fact that\nboth client and server support a given security mechanism.  NEGOEX\nOPTIONALLY
    adds a pair of meta-data messages for each negotiated\nsecurity mechanism.  The
    meta-data exchange allows security\nmechanisms to exchange auxiliary information
    such as trust\nconfigurations, thus NEGOEX provides more flexibility than just\nexchanging
    security mechanism OIDs in SPNEGO.\n\nNEGOEX preserves the optimistic token semantics
    of SPNEGO and applies\nthat recursively.  Consequently a context establishment
    mechanism\ntoken can be included in the initial NEGOEX message, and NEGOEX does\nnot
    require an extra round-trip when the initiator's optimistic token\nis accepted
    by the target.\n\nSimilar to SPNEGO, NEGOEX defines a few new GSS-API extensions
    that a\nsecurity mechanism MUST support in order to be negotiated by NEGOEX.\nThis
    document defines these GSS-API extensions.\n\nUnlike SPNEGO however, NEGOEX defines
    its own way for signing the\nprotocol messages in order to protect the protocol
    negotiation.  The\nNEGOEX message signing or verification can occur before the
    security\ncontext for the negotiated real security mechanism is fully\nestablished.\n\t
