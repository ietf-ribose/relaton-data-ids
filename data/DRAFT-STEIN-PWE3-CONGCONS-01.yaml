abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling\n
    \  traffic, and may be found competing for network resources both with\n   other
    PWs and with non-PW traffic, such as TCP/IP flows.  It is thus\n   worthwhile
    specifying under what conditions such competition is safe,\n   i.e., the PW traffic
    does not significantly harm other traffic or\n   contribute more than it should
    to congestion.  We conclude that PWs\n   transporting responsive traffic behave
    as desired without the need\n   for additional mechanisms.  For inelastic PWs
    (such as TDM PWs) we\n   derive a bound under which such PWs consume no more network
    capacity\n   than a TCP flow.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
