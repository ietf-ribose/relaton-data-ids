abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight
    web\n   transfer protocol designed to be used in constrained nodes and\n   constrained
    networks.  Communication security support for CoAP,\n   including authentication,
    encryption, integrity protection, is\n   specified by means of a DTLS binding
    for CoAP, but authorization and\n   access control are not described in detail.\n\n
    \  This document describes a generic and dynamic access control\n   framework
    suitable for constrained environments e.g. using CoAP.  The\n   framework builds
    on standards and well known paradigms for access\n   control, externalizing authorization
    decision making to unconstrained\n   nodes while performing authorization decision
    enforcement and\n   verification of local conditions in constrained devices.\n\n\n\t
