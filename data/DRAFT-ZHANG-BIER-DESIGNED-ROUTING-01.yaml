abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BIER specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast\n
    \  data packets.  As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] said, in the BIER\n   domain,
    it does not require a protocol for explicitly building\n   multicast distributing
    trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes\n   to maintain any per-flow state.
    \ In some deployments, some specific\n   multicast flows may be forwarded by special
    routing; it cannot be\n   achieved by the forwarding rule that is provided.  In
    this document\n   we will defined a new routing list in BIER header, the packets
    will\n   be steered according to the routing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
