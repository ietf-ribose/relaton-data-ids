abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions
    are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one
    or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor
    networks. This document defines a publish- subscribe broker for CoAP that extends
    the capabilities of CoAP for supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity
    and/or up-time.</p>"
