abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes some scenarios in which one can imagine\ninternationalized
    email addresses deployed, and tries to draw some\nconclusions about what's acceptable
    and what's not for users in those\nscenarios.\n\nOne possible set of extensions
    that can work in these scenarios is\nthose described in the UTF8SMTP extension
    documents.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
    [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
