abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Fast Payload Replication (FPR) is a technique for fanning out thepayloads
    of individual packets to large numbers of recipients. Itwas developed as the central
    part of Ivip's real-time mappingdistribution system. However, as of late February
    2010, Ivip has anew mapping system: Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) whichoperates
    on different principles. Therefore, the material in this IDis no longer an essential
    part of Ivip. Some of it may be useful forother purposes and for two potential
    purposes in Ivip, both of whichare entirely optional.</p>"
