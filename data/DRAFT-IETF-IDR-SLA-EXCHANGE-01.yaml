abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network administrators typically provision QoS (Quality of
    Service)\n   policies for their application traffic (such as voice, video) based\n
    \  on SLAs (Service Level Agreements) negotiated with their providers,\n   and
    translate those SLAs to vendor specific configuration language.\n   Both learning
    of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other\n   out-of-band method, and
    translating them to vendor specific\n   configuration language is a complex, many
    times manual, process and\n   prone to errors.  This document proposes an in-band
    method of SLA\n   signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities.\n\n
    \  This document defines an operational transitive attribute to signal\n   SLA
    details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as\n   Autonomous
    Systems (AS)), thus simplify and speed-up some of the\n   complex provisioning
    tasks.\n\n   Though the use case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined\n
    \  in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this\n   use
    case only.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
