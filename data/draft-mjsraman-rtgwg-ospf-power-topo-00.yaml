abstract:
- content: "<p>In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
    the computation of the shortest path tree to all destinations is computed for
    an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area. With importance given to the reduction
    of power within a network it becomes important to provide a solution that reduces
    the power consumed amongst routers and links that make up the network (in this
    case an area or a collection of areas including the backbone and non- backbone
    areas). This proposal aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology
    of the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning metrics to
    links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and hence their respective
    ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers that are interconnected by each
    such link.</p>"
