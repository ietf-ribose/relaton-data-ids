abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a lightweight method for cryptographically
    protecting a portion of the contents of a Diameter message in transit between
    an arbitrary pair of Diameter nodes. The scheme assumes that the destination node
    possesses an X.509 certificate containing an RSA public key and that that certificate
    is retrievable through a DNS query by the node originating the message. In addition
    to describing the operation of the protocol, this note specifies an Attribute-Value
    Pair (AVP) for the encapsulation of encrypted AVPs.</p>"
