abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a Traffic Engineered (TE) Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Label\n
    \  Switched Path (LSP), it is preferable in some cases to re-evaluate\n   and
    re-optimize the entire P2MP-TE LSP by re-signaling all its\n   Source-to-Leaf
    (S2L) sub-LSP(s).  Existing mechanisms, a mechanism\n   for an ingress Label Switched
    Router (LSR) to trigger a new path\n   re-evaluation request and a mechanism for
    a mid-point LSR to notify\n   an availability of a preferred path, operate on
    an individual or a\n   sub-group of S2L sub-LSP(s) basis only.\n\n   This document
    defines Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling\n   extensions to allow
    an ingress node of a P2MP-TE LSP to request the\n   re-evaluation of the entire
    LSP tree containing one or more S2L\n   sub-LSPs whose paths are loose (or abstract)
    hop expanded, and for a\n   mid-point LSR to notify to the ingress node that a
    preferable tree\n   exists for the entire P2MP-TE LSP.  For re-optimizing a group
    of S2L\n   sub-LSP(s) in a tree, an S2L sub-LSP descriptor list can be used to\n
    \  signal one or more S2L sub-LSPs in an RSVP message.  This document\n   defines
    markers to indicate beginning and end of an S2L sub-LSP\n   descriptor list when
    the RSVP message needs to be fragmented due to\n   large number of S2L sub-LSPs
    in the message when performing sub-group\n   based re-optimization.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
