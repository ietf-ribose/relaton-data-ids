abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Periodic IPv6 router advertisements are a concern in mobile
    and\n   cellular networks in which the hosts are attached to the network and\n
    \  access router but switch state to dormant mode in order to conserve\n   battery
    power.  In addition the air interface is a resource that\n   should be used optimally
    and hence periodic router advertisements\n   that an access router would send
    should be limited.  Transmission of\n   Periodic router advertisements to hosts
    on a link by a router should\n   be optional.  At the very least the interval
    between such router\n   advertisements should be configurable to a value that
    is\n   significantly higher than currently specified.  This document\n   provides
    a recommendation for the periodic router advertisement\n   interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval)
    and router lifetime.\n\t </p>\n      "
