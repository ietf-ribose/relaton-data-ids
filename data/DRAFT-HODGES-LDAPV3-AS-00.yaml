abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The specification for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    version\n3 (LDAPv3) nominally comprises eight separte RFCs which were issued in\ntwo
    distinct subsets at separate times (RFCs 2251..2256 first, then RFCs\n2229 and
    2830 following later), but this has never been formally stated.\nAdditionally,
    RFCs 2251..2256 each are embellished with an 'IESG Note'\nwarning implementors
    and deployers of potential interoperability prob-\nlems due to the lack of a specification
    of mandatory-to-implement\nauthentication mechanism(s). This document corrects
    both situations by\nexplicitly specifying the set of RFCs comprising LDAPv3 and
    rescinding\nthe 'IESG Note' due to the specification of mandatory-to-implement\nauthentication
    mechanisms in RFC 2829.\n\t </p>\n      "
