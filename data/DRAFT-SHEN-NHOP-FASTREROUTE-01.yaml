abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism called NFRR (Nexthop\nFast
    ReRoute) to perform fast re-route for any type of traffic\nin the event of a link/node
    failure or a nexthop unreachable.\nThe protected traffic can be IP, MPLS, unicast
    or multicast.\nThe re-routed traffic can either be destined to the nexthop\nrouter
    or to the next-nexthop router. RSVP explicitly routed LSPs\nare used as a tool
    to perform the local patch for minimizing\nthe packet loss.\n\t </p>\n      "
