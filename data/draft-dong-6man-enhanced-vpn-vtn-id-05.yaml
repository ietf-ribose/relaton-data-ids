abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which has a
    customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources
    allocated from the physical network. A VTN can be used as the underlay for one
    or a group of overlay VPNs to provide enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. In packet
    forwarding, some fields in the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN
    the packet belongs to, so that the VTN-specific processing can be performed on
    each node the packet traverses. This document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop option
    of IPv6 extension header to carry the VTN Resource ID, which is used to identify
    the set of network resources allocated to a VTN for packet processing. The procedure
    for processing the VTN option is also specified.</p>"
