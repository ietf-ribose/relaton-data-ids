  content: "<p>This document recommends that recursive DNS resolvers get copies of
    the root zone, validate it using DNSSEC, populate their caches with the information,
    and also give negative responses from the validated zone. [[ Note: This document
    is largely a discussion starting point. ]]</p>"
