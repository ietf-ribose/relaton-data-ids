abstract:
- content: "<p>Mail Divide Framework (MDF) is a recipient driven partitioning framework
    for E-Mail delivery. A protocol to divide mail delivery at the source of the message
    is defined in this draft. A mechanism called Reputation Service Provider is also
    introduced so that a third-party authority can assure senders' trust. With MDF,
    subdomaining is used for category-specific MTA designation. Senders decide which
    category the outgoing mail belongs. It then looks up DNS TXT record to find whether
    the recipient advertises a specific server for that category. The specified server
    puts the received mail into a corresponding per-category inbox for the user.</p>"
