abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism by which the set of addresses\n
    \   bound to an application-level Datagram Congestion Control Protocol\n    (DCCP)
    connection [RFC4340] can change over that connection's\n    lifetime.  The essential
    abstraction is the Generalized Connection,\n    which combines multiple distinct
    transport-level DCCP connections\n    into a single application-level entity.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
