abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Authentication is perhaps the most basic security problem for design-ers
    of network protocols. Even the early Internet protocols such asTELNET and FTP,
    which provided no other security services, made pro-vision for user authentication.
    Unfortunately, these early authenti-cation systems were wholly inadequate for
    the Internet Threat Model[REF] and a vast array of other authentication mechanisms
    have beenintroduced in an attempt to close these holes.The most striking thing
    about these security mechanisms is how manyof them are essentially similar. There
    are only 7 basic classes ofauthentication protocol but there are a large number
    of slightly dif-ferent protocols with essentially the same security properties.
    Thismemo surveys the space of authentication mechanisms, describes thebasic classes
    and provides examples of protocols which fit into eachclass.</p>"
