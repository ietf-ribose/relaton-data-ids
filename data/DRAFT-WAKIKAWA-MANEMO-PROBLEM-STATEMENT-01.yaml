abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The NEMO Basic Support protocol has well-known issues when
    multiple\n   mobile routers are connected to each other in a nested fashion.\n
    \  These issues have been already analyzed in the NEMO Working Group.\n   However,
    solutions are not yet considered and discussed in the IETF.\n   MANEMO (MANET
    for NEMO) is an approach to resolve these issues.\n   Although most of issues
    are relevant to what the MANET working group\n   is chartered to deliver, a different
    approach may be required.  This\n   document identifies the problems which MANEMO
    will solve and provides\n   the MANEMO requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
