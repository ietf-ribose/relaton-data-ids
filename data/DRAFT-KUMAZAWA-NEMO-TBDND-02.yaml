abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When multiple Mobile Routers share the same prefix, a Home
    Agent must\n   be able to verify whether the Mobile Routers share the same Mobile\n
    \  Network or not.  Otherwise, the Home Agent may not be able to forward\n   a
    data packet to a correct recipient since the recipient may not be\n   connected
    to the mobile router the Home Agent chooses to forward the\n   packet.  This document
    describes a Token based Duplicate Network\n   Detection mechanism that enables
    a Home Agent to detect whether\n   multiple Mobile Rotuers claiming the same prefix
    are in the same\n   Mobile Network.\n\t </p>\n      "
