abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Degradation or forced service termination may occur because of\n
    \  frequent handoffs that may occur within NEMO networks. This paper\n   presents
    a resource reservation scheme aiming at supporting quality\n   of service guaranty.
    We focus on a reservation protocol adapted to\n   NEMO specifications. For doing
    so, we use a generic signaling\n   protocol that may exploit advantages of both
    reservation protocols;\n   IntServ and DiffServ.\n\t </p>\n      "
