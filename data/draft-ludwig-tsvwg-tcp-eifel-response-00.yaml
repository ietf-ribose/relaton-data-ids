abstract:
  content: "<p>The Eifel response algorithm uses the Eifel detection algorithm todetect
    a posteriori whether the TCP sender has entered loss recoveryunnecessarily. In
    response to a spurious timeout it avoids thego-back-N retransmits that would otherwise
    be sent, and reinitializesthe RTT estimators to avoid further spurious timeouts.
    Likewise, itadapts the duplicate acknowledgement threshold in response to aspurious
    fast retransmit. In both cases, the Eifel response algorithmrestores the congestion
    control state in way that avoids packetbursts.</p>"
