abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an OPTIONAL feature extending the NFSv4 protocol
    which allows extended attributes (hereinafter also referred to as xattrs) to be
    interrogated and manipulated using NFSv4 clients. Xattrs are provided by a file
    system to associate opaque metadata, not interpreted by the file system, with
    files and directories. Such support is present in many modern local file systems.
    New file attributes are provided to allow clients to query the server for xattr
    support, with that support consisting of new operations to get and set xattrs
    on file system objects.</p>"
