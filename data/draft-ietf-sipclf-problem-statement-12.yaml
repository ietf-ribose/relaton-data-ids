abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squid support
    event logging using a common log format. The logs produced using these de-facto
    standard formats are invaluable to system administrators for trouble-shooting
    a server and tool writers to craft tools that mine the log files and produce reports
    and trends. Furthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomaly detection
    systems and feed events into a security event management system. The Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) does not have a common log format, and as a result, each server
    supports a distinct log format that makes it unnecessarily complex to produce
    tools to do trend analysis and security detection. This document describes a framework,
    including requirements and analysis of existing approaches, and specifies an information
    model for development of a SIP common log file format that can be used uniformly
    by user agents, proxies, registrars, redirect servers as well as back-to-back
    user agents.</p>"
