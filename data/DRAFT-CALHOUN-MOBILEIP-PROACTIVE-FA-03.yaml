abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using
    the\nsame home address even after changing its point of attachment to the\nInternet.
    \ This provides transparency to most existing applications\nthat assume a fixed
    address and a fixed point of attachment.\nHowever, new applications, such as voice-over-IP,
    have additional\nreal-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachment\nwill
    cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additional\nsteps are taken to
    reduce the latency of a handoff event.\nThis specification proposes extensions
    to the Mobile IP protocol that\nmay be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile
    Node's visitor\nentry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formal\nRegistration
    Request from the Mobile Node.  This enables a very rapid\nestablishment of service
    at the new point of attachment so that the\neffect of the handoff on real-time
    applications is minimized.\n\t </p>\n      "
