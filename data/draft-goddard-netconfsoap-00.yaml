abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While the device management protocol NETCONF is generally well servedby
    BEEP, there are environments where additional transports aredesirable. The binding
    to SOAP described here may find applicationwhere SOAP-based tools and implementations
    are prevalent or where thenetwork configuration favors HTTP. When used with multiple
    HTTPconnections, SOAP over HTTP is sufficient for all NETCONF featuresexcept those
    involving asynchronous notification.</p>"
