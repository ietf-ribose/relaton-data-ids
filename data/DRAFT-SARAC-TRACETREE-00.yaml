abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new mechanism for discovering multicast
    \ntree topology in the network. It uses the existing multicast \nforwarding state
    information to discovery tree topology in the \nsource-to-receiver(s) direction.
    Scalability is provided by \nusing a modified version of standard TTL based scoping.
    This draft \nidentifies  important issues necessary for discovering tree topology
    \nin the source-to-receiver(s) direction and discusses potential \nsolutions to
    handle them.\n\t </p>\n      "
