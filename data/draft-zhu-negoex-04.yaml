abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines the SPNEGO Extended Negotiation (NEGOEX)Security
    Mechanism. NEGOEX enhances the capabilities of SPNEGO byproviding a security mechanism
    which can be negotiated by the SPNEGOprotocol as defined in RFC4178.The NEGOEX
    protocol itself is a security mechanism negotiated bySPNEGO. When the NEGOEX security
    mechanism is selected by SPNEGO,NEGOEX provides a method allowing selection of
    a commonauthentication protocol based on factors beyond just the fact thatboth
    client and server support a given security mechanism. NEGOEXOPTIONALLY adds a
    pair of meta-data messages for each negotiatedsecurity mechanism. The meta-data
    exchange allows securitymechanisms to exchange auxiliary information such as trustconfigurations,
    thus NEGOEX provides more flexibility than justexchanging security mechanism OIDs
    in SPNEGO.NEGOEX preserves the optimistic token semantics of SPNEGO and appliesthat
    recursively. Consequently a context establishment mechanismtoken can be included
    in the initial NEGOEX message, and NEGOEX doesnot require an extra round-trip
    when the initiator's optimistic tokenis accepted by the target.Similar to SPNEGO,
    NEGOEX defines a few new GSS-API extensions that asecurity mechanism MUST support
    in order to be negotiated by NEGOEX.This document defines these GSS-API extensions.Unlike
    SPNEGO however, NEGOEX defines its own way for signing theprotocol messages in
    order to protect the protocol negotiation. TheNEGOEX message signing or verification
    can occur before the securitycontext for the negotiated real security mechanism
    is fullyestablished.</p>"
