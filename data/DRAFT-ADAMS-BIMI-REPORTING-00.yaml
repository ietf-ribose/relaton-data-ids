abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To support the utility of Brand Indicators for Message Identification\n
    \  (BIMI), domains publishing BIMI records may find it useful to know\n   when
    their logos are failing to be displayed as expected.  When an\n   entity, for
    example a mailbox operator, determines whether or not to\n   display the logo
    identified in the BIMI record, they may encounter\n   errors trying to retrieve
    the image file.  Similarly, the associated\n   evidence document used to validate
    the logo may fail evaluation.  In\n   other cases, the evaluator may decide that
    despite everything\n   validating, they may rely on local policies that determine
    validated\n   logos should still not be displayed.  This specification defines
    how\n   BIMI evaluators should report their evaluation outcome back to the\n   publisher
    within the context of existing Domain-based Message\n   Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) reports.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
