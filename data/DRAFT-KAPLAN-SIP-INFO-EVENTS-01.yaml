abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the INFO method and a mechanism for defining,
    \n   negotiating and exchanging Info Packages in it.  INFO requests are \n   used
    within SIP INVITE-created dialogs, for applications which need \n   to exchange
    session-related information inside the INVITE-created \n   dialog.  This draft
    addresses issues and open items from RFC 2976, \n   and replaces it.\n\t </p>\n
