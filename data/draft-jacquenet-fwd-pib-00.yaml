abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the enforcement
    of an IP forwarding policy by network devices. Instances of such classes reside
    in a virtual information store, which is called the IP Forwarding Policy Information
    Base (PIB). The corresponding IP forwarding policy provisioning data are intended
    for use by a COPS-PR TE Client-Type, and they complement the PRC classes that
    have been defined in the Framework PIB.</p>"
