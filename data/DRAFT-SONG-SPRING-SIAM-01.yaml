abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a data-plane in-band active measurement
    method\n   for SRv6.  A packet containing an SRH uses a flag bit to indicate it\n
    \  is a probing packet.  The IOAM header and data are encapsulated in\n   UDP
    payload.  The probing packet originates from a segment source\n   node and terminates
    at a configured segment endpoint node.  Each\n   segment node on the path, when
    detecting the flag, parses the UDP\n   header and the IOAM header, and adds data
    to the IOAM node data\n   fields.  The method avoids the performance and encapsulation
    issues\n   for applying IOAM in SRv6 networks.  Multiple applications can be\n
    \  supported by the method.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
