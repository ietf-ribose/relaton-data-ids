abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Over the last year, the Internet community has slowly come to
    realize\nthat the IANA and RIR IPv4 free address pool will be exhausted within\nno
    more than 3-4 years, and possibly sooner.  At that point, it will\nbecome increasingly
    difficult for ISPs and end sites to obtain the\npublic IPv4 address space they
    need to expand operations.\n\nIPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion
    problem,\nbut widespread deployment has barely begun.  This document reiterates\nthe
    IETF's support and continued commitment to IPv6.  IPv6 deployment\nis still necessary
    to ensure the continued growth and expansion of\nthe Internet.  Deployment of
    IPv6 is needed to preserve important\nInternet properties that have made it a
    success and enable new\ngenerations of applications and services.\n\t </p>\n      "
