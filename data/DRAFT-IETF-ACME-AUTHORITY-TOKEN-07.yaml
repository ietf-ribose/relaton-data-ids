abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some proposed extensions to the Automated Certificate Management\n
    \  Environment (ACME) rely on proving eligibility for certificates\n   through
    consulting an external authority that issues a token\n   according to a particular
    policy.  This document specifies a generic\n   Authority Token challenge for ACME
    which supports subtype claims for\n   different identifiers or namespaces that
    can be defined separately\n   for specific applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
