abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of Beyond Edge Computing (BEC)
    which brings edge computing capabilities down to the level of customers' premises
    for industrial IoT use cases. The purpose of the document is to discuss the general
    problem statement of BEC including capabilities, and use cases. Potential technical
    gaps in IETF problem scope that are related to BEC are also evaluated.</p>"
