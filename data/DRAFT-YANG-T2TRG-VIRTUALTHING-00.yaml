abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidance of IoT architecture based on
    virtual\n   thing environment for security. In the heterogeneous IoT environment,\n
    \  Internet of Things(IoT) have a limitation in adapting management\n   function
    such as updating software, adopting various general\n   cryptography mechanisms
    since they have limited processing power,\n   storage space and transmission capacities.
    Moreover, IoT could not\n   support all of requirement for IoT management function
    in\n   heterogeneous environment. Especially, security is one of the issue\n   in
    heterogeneous environments. Therefore, this draft describes IoT\n   architecture
    based on virtual thing environment and classify the\n   requirements as well as
    problem statement.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
