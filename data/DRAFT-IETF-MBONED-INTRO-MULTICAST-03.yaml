abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting,\nthe
    MBone, Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group\nManagement
    Protocol (IGMP).  The second section explores a number of\ndifferent techniques
    that may potentially be employed by multicast\nrouting protocols:\n \n    o  Flooding\n
    \   o  Spanning Trees\n    o  Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB)\n    o  Truncated
    Reverse Path Broadcasting (TRPB)\n    o  Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM)\n    o
    \ ''Shared-Tree'' Techniques\n \nThe third part contains the main body of the
    paper.  It describes how\nthe previous techniques are implemented in multicast
    routing protocols\navailable today (or under development).\n \n    o  Distance
    Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)\n    o  Multicast Extensions to OSPF
    (MOSPF)\n    o  Protocol-Independent Multicast - Dense Mode (PIM-DM)\n    o  Protocol-Independent
    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)\n    o  Core-Based Trees (CBT)\n\t </p>\n      "
