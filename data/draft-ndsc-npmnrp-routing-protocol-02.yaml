abstract:
- content: <p>The Node Potential Oriented Multi-Nexthop Routing Protocol (NP- MNRP)bases
    on the idea of "hop-by-hop routing forwarding, multi- backup next hop" and combines
    with the phenomena that water flows from higher place to lower. NP-MNRP defines
    a metric named as node potential, which is based on hop count and the actual link
    bandwidth, and calculates multiple next-hops through the potential difference
    between the nodes.</p>
