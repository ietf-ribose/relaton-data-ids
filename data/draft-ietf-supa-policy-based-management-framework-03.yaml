abstract:
- content: "<p>Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG data
    models to encode policy, which point to device-, technology-, and service-specific
    YANG models developed elsewhere. Policy rules within an operator's environment
    can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide policies to a network
    management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).
    The network management function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring
    of network elements and services. This document describes the SUPA basic framework,
    its elements and interfaces.</p>"
