abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes interdependent TCP control blocks, where
    part of\n   the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent or consecutive\n
    \  connections. TCP state includes a combination of parameters, such as\n   connection
    state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion\n   control information,
    and process information. Most of this state is\n   maintained on a per-connection
    basis in the TCP Control Block (TCB),\n   but implementations can (and do) share
    certain TCB information\n   across connections to the same host. Such sharing
    is intended to\n   improve overall transient transport performance, while maintaining\n
    \  backward-compatibility with existing implementations. The sharing\n   described
    herein is limited to only the TCB initialization and so\n   has no effect on the
    long-term behavior of TCP after a connection\n   has been established.\n\n\t </p>\n
