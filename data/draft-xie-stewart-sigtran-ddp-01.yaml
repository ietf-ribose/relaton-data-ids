abstract:
  content: "<p>Data Distribution Protocol (DDP) provides a fault tolerant datatransfer
    mechanism over IP networks. DDP uses a name-based addressingmodel which isolates
    a logical communication endpoint from its IPaddress(es), thus effectively eliminating
    the binding between thecommunication endpoint and its physical IP address(es)
    which normallyconstitutes a single point of failure.In addition, DDP defines each
    logical communication destination as anamed group, providing full transparent
    support for server-pooling andload sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability
    - members of aserver pool can be added or removed at any time without interruptingthe
    service.DDP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancyprovided
    by the Simple Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [1]. Butit can also use other
    transport protocol like TCP.Internally, DDP is made up of two parts, namely the
    Data DistributionControl Part (DDCP) and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP).DDCP
    provides the user interface for name to address translation, loadsharing management,
    and fault management. ENRP defines the faulttolerant name translation service.</p>"
