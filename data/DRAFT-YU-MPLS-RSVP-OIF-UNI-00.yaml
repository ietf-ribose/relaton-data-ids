abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2])
    to \nsupport an Optical User Network Interface (UNI).  This effort is in \npart
    driven by work in the OIF as well as the recent draft on \nsignaling requirements
    for the optical UNI ([3]), and is consistent \nwith recent work on Generalized
    MPLS (see [4], [5], [6], and [7]) in \nIETF.  The main function of this draft
    is to identify the relevant \nmechanisms in RSVP-TE (including further extensions)
    to satisfy \nfunctional requirements for an Optical UNI.\n\t </p>\n      "
