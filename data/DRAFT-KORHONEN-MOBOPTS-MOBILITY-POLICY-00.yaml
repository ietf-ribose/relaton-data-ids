abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has developed many IP Mobility protocols, some of
    which have\n   been successfully deployed.  There has also been work done on\n
    \  enabling fast and efficient handovers at L3 and extensions to access\n   control
    protocols to enable fast handovers.  One aspect that has not\n   been considered
    so far is the policies that a user is subjected to\n   when accessing a subscribed
    network.  These policies, defined by the\n   network operator, have a significant
    impact on the user's mobility\n   experience.  This document aims to provide a
    discussion document on\n   policy control and IP Mobility in controlled operator
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
