abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the
    server\n   side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n
    \  that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called\n   Converters.
    \ Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to\n   facilitate the
    adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path\n   communications without
    making any assumption about the support of\n   MPTCP by the communicating peers.
    \ Converters located in the network\n   are responsible for establishing multi-path
    communications on behalf\n   of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities
    to\n   achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    focuses on the explicit deployment scheme where the\n   identity of the Converters
    is explicitly configured on connected\n   hosts.  This document specifies DHCP
    (IPv4 and IPv6) options to\n   configure hosts with Converters parameters.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
