abstract:
  content: <p>The Multimob WG has defined a basic mobile multicast solutionleveraging
    on network localized mobility management, i.e. ProxyMobile IPv6 protocol. The
    basic solution incorporates multicastaware routers co-located with the mobility
    anchor and a proxy functionality for group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD, at the accessgateway.
    Although such a basic solution solves the issue from an operational point of view,
    challenges with respect to optimization,e.g. efficient resource utilization, still
    remain.This document attempts to evaluate proposed solutions for thechartered
    work item of "PMIPv6 routing optimizations to avoid tunnelconvergence problem".
    A corresponding deployment specific extensionwould cover dynamic and/or automatic
    tunnel configuration and adirect or local routing approach.</p>
