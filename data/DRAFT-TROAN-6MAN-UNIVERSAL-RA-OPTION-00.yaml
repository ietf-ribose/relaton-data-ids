abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The intentions for the IPv6 host configuration design, was
    to\n   configure the core network layer parameters with IPv6 ND, and use\n   service
    discovery for other configuration parameters.  Unfortunately\n   that hasn't panned
    out as planned, and we are in a situation where\n   all kinds of configuration
    options are requested in RAs and in DHCP.\n   This document proposes an a new
    universal option, formatted in JSON.\n   The list of elements are maintained in
    an IANA registry, with greatly\n   relaxed rules for registration.\n\n\t </p>\n
