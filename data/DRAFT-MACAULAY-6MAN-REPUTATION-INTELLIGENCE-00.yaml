abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft represent the initial public discussion of the value
    of\n   proactive, reputation intelligence on the Internet and some of the\n   challenges
    associated with these services that may be partially\n   addressed through novel
    use of IPv6 features and functions.\n\n   This document is intended to outline
    the concept of Internet\n   reputation intelligence, the benefits it brings to
    network elements\n   and endpoints.  This draft also addresses the challenges
    associated\n   with legacy security systems based on threat-signatures, and some
    of\n   the current weaknesses of reputation management systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
