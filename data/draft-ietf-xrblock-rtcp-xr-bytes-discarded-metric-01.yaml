    time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term and long-term
    reception statistics. The available reporting may include aggregate information
    across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting. This document
    specifies a report computing the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after
    successful reception.</p>"
