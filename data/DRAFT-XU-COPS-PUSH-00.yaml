abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   COPS (RFC 2748) was originally designed for pull mode operation.
    \ The\n   message exchanges for pull mode are efficient and support a close\n
    \  relationship between the protocol operations and state associated\n   with
    particular events detected at the Policy Enforcement Point\n   (PEP).  The operation
    of push mode, as defined in COPS-PR (RFC 3084),\n   is more awkward.  Push mode
    involves extra messaging between the PEP\n   and the Policy Decision Point (PDP)
    if one again wants to associate\n   state arising from specific events (this time
    detected at the PDP)\n   with specific protocol operations.\n\n   This memo proposes
    to modify RFC 2748 to make push mode operation\n   more efficient.  Comments are
    invited on whether there are issues\n   with the proposed solution.\n\n\t </p>\n
