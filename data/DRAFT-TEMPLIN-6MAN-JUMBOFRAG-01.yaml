abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unlike Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4), Internet Protocol,\n
    \  version 6 (IPv6) does not include an Identification field in the\n   basic
    packet header.  Instead, IPv6 includes a 32-bit Identification\n   field in a
    Fragment Header extension since the architecture assumed\n   that the sole purpose
    for the Identification is to support the\n   fragmentation and reassembly process.
    \ This document asserts that\n   per-packet Identifications may be useful for
    other purposes, e.g., to\n   allow recipients to detect spurious packets that
    may have been\n   injected into the network by an attacker.  But, rather than
    defining\n   a new extension header, this document recommends employing the\n
    \  existing Fragment Header for per-packet identification even if the\n   packet
    itself appears as an \"atomic fragment\".\n\n\t </p>\n      "
