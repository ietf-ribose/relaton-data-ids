abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
    origin\n   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n
    \  signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain-of-trust
    starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular node in the
    DNS.  This document specifies a way for\n   validating end-system resolvers to
    signal to a server which keys are\n   referenced in their chain-of-trust.  The
    extensions allow zone\n   administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers
    in a DNSSEC-\n   signed zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
