abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how hosts using IPv6 Stateless Address\nAutoconfiguration
    can be used in a MANET, without a need for any\nchange, neither in functioning
    of Neighbor Discovery nor in MANET\nprotocols.  In addition, legacy hosts nor
    other parts of the network\nare faced any deviation on the IPv6 Addressing architecture.\n\t
