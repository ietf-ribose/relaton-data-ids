abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document analyzes the interoperability problems surrounding
    the\ncall-completion feature that allows a callee to put a caller's\nrequest into
    a queue by which the caller can be notified to call back\nthe callee at later
    time.  This document analyzes how different\nsolutions inter-operate and tries
    to make recommendation on how to\nbest meet this requirement\n\t </p>\n      "
