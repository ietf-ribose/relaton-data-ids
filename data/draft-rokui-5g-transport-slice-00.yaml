abstract:
- content: "<p>The 5G Network slicing is an approach to provide separate independent
    E2E logical network from user equipment (UE) to applications where each network
    slice has different SLA requirements. Each E2E network slice consists of multitude
    of RAN-slice, Core-slice and Transport- slices, each with its own controller.
    To provide automation, assurance and optimization of the network slices, an E2E
    network slice controller is needed which interacts with controller in RAN, Core
    and Transport slices. The interfaces between the E2E network slice controller
    and RAN and Core controllers are defined in various 3GPP technical specifications.
    However, 3GPP has not defined the same interface for transport slices. The aim
    of this document is to provide the clarification of this interface and to provide
    the information model of this interface for automation, monitoring and optimization
    of the transport slices.</p>"
