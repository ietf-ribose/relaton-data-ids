abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
    for hardware device identifiers. A general representation of device identity can
    be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage or
    in equipment inventories. A URN-based representation can be passed along in applications
    that need the information.</p>"
