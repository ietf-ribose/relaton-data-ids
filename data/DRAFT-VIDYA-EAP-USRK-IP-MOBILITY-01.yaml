abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication
    in\nvarious networks.  Also, key generating EAP methods are being adopted\nin
    various systems for the purposes of cryptographic protection\nbetween an EAP peer
    and an enforcement point in the network.  Key\ngenerating EAP methods produce
    an MSK and an EMSK in accordance with\n[1].  The MSK is meant for use by the EAP
    lower layer at the peer and\nthe authenticator and is used differently by various
    lower layers.\nThe EMSK hierarchy is defined in [2].  The EMSK hierarchy is meant
    to\nbe extensible to derive keys for various usages.  This document\ndefines the
    key hierarchy and key derivations for using the EMSK\nhierarchy for keying in
    IP mobility protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
