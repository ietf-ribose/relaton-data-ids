abstract:
- content: "<p>Most TCP connections are protected from spoofing attacks from off-
    path attackers by their obscurity. This memo suggests that the few TCP connections
    that aren't so protected today may be protected by making them obscure by using
    random values for both port numbers. The obvious difficulty with this approach
    is that the well-known port number is required on the initial SYN to connect to
    the desired service. A TCP option is proposed which can be used during the SYN
    and SYN-ACK exchange to request (and accomplish) reassignment of the well known
    port number to a random value.</p>"
