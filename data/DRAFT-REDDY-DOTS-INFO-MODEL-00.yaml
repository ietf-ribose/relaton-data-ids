abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the need and the mechanisms to dynamically\n
    \  update configuration of network monitoring devices to help identify\n   distributed
    denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in a network.  Once an\n   attack is signalled
    by a client or detected locally, provisioning\n   cycles are triggered to program
    a set of network elements to\n   undertake appropriate actions (including, blackhole,
    drop, rate-\n   limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic.\n\n\t </p>\n
