abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes some observations on the effects of virtualization
    on Internet architecture, as well as provides some guidelines for further work
    at the IETF relating to virtualization. This document also provides a summary
    of IETF technologies that relate to network virtualization. An understanding of
    what current technologies there exist and what they can or cannot do is the first
    step in developing plans for possible extensions.</p>"
