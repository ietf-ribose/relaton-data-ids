abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), described in
    \ [1],  pro-\n     vides  a  standard  mechanism for support of additional authentication\n
    \    methods within PPP.  Through the use of EAP, support for a  number  of      authentication
    \ schemes may be added, including smart cards, Kerberos,\n     Public Key, One
    Time Passwords, and others.  In order to  provide  for\n     support of EAP within
    RADIUS, two new attributes, EAP-Message and Sig-\n     nature, were introduced
    as RADIUS extensions  in  [4].  This  document\n     describes  how these new
    attributes may be used for providing EAP sup-\n     port within RADIUS.\n\n\n\t
