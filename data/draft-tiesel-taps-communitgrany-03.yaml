abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an approach how to reason about the composition
    of multi-path aware transport stacks. It discusses how to compose the functionality
    needed by stacking existing internet protocols and the fundamental mechanisms
    that are used in multi-path systems and the consequences of applying them to different
    granularities of communication units, e.g, on a message or stream granularity.
    This document is targeted as guidance for automation of destination selection,
    path selection, and transport protocol selection.</p>"
