abstract:
  content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem is beingdiscussed
    within the IETF and more globally by the research communityand some enterprises.
    In this memo, we argue that it is important toconceive general-purpose mechanisms
    to solve this problem. Bygeneral-purpose we say not only application independent
    but alsolayer independent mechanism. The generality can be obtained becausethe
    underlying problem is the same regardless the application or thelayer.</p>"
