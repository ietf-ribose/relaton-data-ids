abstract:
  content: "<p>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) hastraditionally
    been done using vendor-specific monitoring,configuration and control methods.
    Although some service monitoringplatforms can test the functionality of the DNS
    itself there is not ainteroperable way to manage (monitor, control and configure)
    theinternal aspects of a name server itself.This document discusses the requirements
    of a management system forDNS name servers. A management solution that is designed
    to managethe DNS can use this document as a shopping list of needed features.</p>"
