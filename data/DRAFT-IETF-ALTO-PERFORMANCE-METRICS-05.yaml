abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the\n   Endpoint
    Cost Service.\n\n   Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.
    \ For\n   example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that offer\n
    \  a low delay delivery to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO\n   protocol
    [ALTO] has documented only one single cost metric, i.e., the\n   generic \"routingcost\"
    metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification\n   [ALTO]).\n\n   This document,
    proposes a set of Cost Metrics, derived and aggregated\n   from routing protocols
    with different granularity and scope, such as\n   BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE,
    or from end-to-end traffic management\n   tools.  It currently documents Network
    Performance Cost Metrics\n   reporting on network delay, jitter, packet loss,
    hop count, and\n   bandwidth.  These metrics may be exposed by an ALTO Server
    to allow\n   applications to determine \"where\" to connect based on network\n
    \  performance criteria.  Additional Cost Metrics involving ISP specific\n   considerations
    or other network technologies may be documented in\n   further versions of this
    draft.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
