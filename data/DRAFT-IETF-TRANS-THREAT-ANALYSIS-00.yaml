abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a threat model for the Web PKI context
    in\n   which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site\n   certificates
    will be developed. The threat model covers both\n   syntactic and semantic mis-issuance,
    using a taxonomy of threats\n   starting with whether the mis-issuance was done
    by the CA\n   maliciously or not; then whether or not the certificate was logged;\n
    \  and then whether the log(s) or monitor(s) are benign or malicious,\n   whether
    the certificate subject is self-monitoring and whether a\n   client is doing any
    checks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
