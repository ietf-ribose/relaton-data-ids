abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Source port randomization has been suggested to provide improvedsecurity
    and obfuscation which helps in adding robustness towardsblind attacks. With TCP
    in practice, simply producing a random portas the source port for a new connection
    can lead to problems when aTCP client establishes connections to a TCP server
    at a high rate.If the same source port value is chosen twice, the client TCPconnection
    can fail due to the server having the Transmission ControlBlock (TCB) for this
    tuple lingering in TIME-WAIT state.This memo discusses the ramifications of such
    source port reusescenarios and suggests some mitigations to avoid the same.</p>"
