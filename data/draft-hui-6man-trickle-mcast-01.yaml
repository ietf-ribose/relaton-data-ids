abstract:
- content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are typically composed of resource
    constrained nodes communicating over links that have dynamic characteristics.
    Memory constraints coupled with temporal variations in link connectivity makes
    the use of topology maintenance to support IPv6 multicast challenging. This document
    describes the use of Trickle to efficiently forward multicast messages without
    the need for topology maintenance.</p>"
