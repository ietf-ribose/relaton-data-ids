abstract:
  content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are typically composed ofresource
    constrained nodes communicating over links that have dynamiccharacteristics. Memory
    constraints coupled with temporal variationsin link connectivity makes the use
    of topology maintenance to supportIPv6 multicast challenging. This document describes
    the use ofTrickle to efficiently forward multicast messages without the needfor
    topology maintenance.</p>"
