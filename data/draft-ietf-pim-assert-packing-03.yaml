abstract:
- content: "<p>In PIM-SM shared LAN networks, there is typically more than one upstream
    router. When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN from different routers,
    assert packets are sent from these routers to elect a single forwarder. The PIM
    assert packets are sent periodically to keep the assert state. The PIM assert
    packet carries information about a single multicast source and group, along with
    the metric-preference and metric of the route towards the source or RP. This document
    defines a standard to send and receive information for multiple multicast sources
    and groups in a single PIM assert message. This can be particularly helpful when
    there is traffic for a large number of multicast groups.</p>"
