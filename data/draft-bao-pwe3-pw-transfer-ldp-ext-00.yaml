abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to LDP signaling that enables the
    PWownership transfer between the Management Plane and the ControlPlane. This document
    defines all PW transfer related procedures.This includes the handling of failure
    conditions and subsequentreversion to original state. A basic premise of the extension
    isthat the transfer procedures must never impact an already establishedData plane
    connection.</p>"
