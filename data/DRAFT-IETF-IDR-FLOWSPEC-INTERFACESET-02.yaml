abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination\n
    \  of traffic flow specification rules.  The primary application of this\n   extension
    is DDoS mitigation where the flowspec rules are applied in\n   most cases to all
    peering routers of the network.\n\n   This document will present another use case
    of BGP flowspec where\n   flow specifications are used to maintain some access
    control lists at\n   network boundary.  BGP flowspec is a very efficient distributing\n
    \  machinery that can help in saving OPEX while deploying/updating ACLs.\n   This
    new application requires flow specification rules to be applied\n   only on a
    specific subset of interfaces and in a specific direction.\n\n   The current specification
    of BGP flowspec ([RFC5575]) introduces the\n   notion of flow specification (which
    describes the matching criterion)\n   and traffic filtering actions.  The flow
    specification is encoded as\n   part of the NLRI while the traffic filtering actions
    are encoded as\n   extended communities.  The combination of a flow specification
    and\n   one or more actions is known as a flow specification rule.  [RFC5575]\n
    \  does not detail where the flow specification rules need to be\n   applied.\n\n
    \  Besides the flow specification and traffic filtering actions, this\n   document
    introduces the notion of traffic filtering scope in order to\n   drive where a
    particular rule must be applied.  In particular, this\n   document introduces
    the \"interface-set\" traffic filtering scope that\n   could be used in parallel
    of traffic filtering actions (marking,\n   rate-limiting ...).  The purpose of
    this extension is to inform\n   remote routers about groups of interfaces where
    the rule must be\n   applied.\n\n   This extension can also be used in a DDoS
    mitigation context where a\n   provider wants to apply the filtering only on specific
    peers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
