abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting the paths through a traffic engineered network. These paths may be
    supplied in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited directions
    issued by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may
    be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC 5575 defines the
    Flow Specification and describes how it may be distributed in BGP to allow specific
    traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document specifies a set of extensions
    to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows a PCE to
    indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.</p>
