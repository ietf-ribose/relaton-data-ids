abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist
    of\n   reusable, self-descriptive components such as Internet media types\n   and
    link relation types.  This document defines a template that\n   application designers
    can use to describe their application's\n   interface in a structured way so that
    other parties can develop\n   interoperable clients and servers or reuse the components
    in their\n   own applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
