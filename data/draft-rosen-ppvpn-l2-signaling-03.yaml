abstract:
  content: "<p>[PWE3-CONTROL] specifies a 'signaling protocol' which uses extensionsof
    LDP [RFC 3036] to set up and maintain pseudowires [PWE3-FR, PWE3-ARCH]. Like any
    protocol which sets up connections, the signalingprotocol provides a method by
    which each endpoint can identify theother. [L2VPN-FW] describes a number of different
    ways in which setsof pseudowires may be combined together into 'Provider ProvisionedLayer
    2 VPNs' (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number ofdifferent kinds of L2VPN.
    Different kinds of L2VPN may havedifferent 'provisioning models', i.e., different
    models for whatinformation needs to be configured in what entities. Once configured,the
    provisioning information is distributed by a 'discovery process',and once the
    information is discovered, the signaling protocol isautomatically invoked to set
    up the required pseudowires. Thesemantics of the endpoint identifiers which the
    signaling protocoluses for a particular type of L2VPN are determined by theprovisioning
    model. This document specifies a number of PPVPNprovisioning models, and specifies
    the semantic structure of theendpoint identifiers required. It further specifies
    how the endpointidentifiers are carried in the 'Generalized Identifier FEC' of[PWE3-CONTROL].
    It is believed that the specified identifiers canalso be carried within the L2TP
    signaling protocol, though this iscurrently not specified.</p>"
