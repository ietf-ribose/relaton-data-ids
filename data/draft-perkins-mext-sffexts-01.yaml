abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in single-radio
    mode will typically need IP address continuity as it migrates from one 4G wireless
    network to another; Mobile IPv6 is very well suited for that purpose. For such
    mobile nodes using Mobile IP, mobility management by the home agent can be extended
    to provide necessary information about the Signal Forwarding Functions (SFFs)
    that have been defined for WiMAX and for eHRPD/CDMA networks. In this document,
    we explain the operations required to support single-radio mobile nodes and specify
    new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement for supporting
    ease of access between mobile nodes and SFFs.</p>"
