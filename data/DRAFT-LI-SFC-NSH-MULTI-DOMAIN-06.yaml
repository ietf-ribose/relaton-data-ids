abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the mechanism to achieve multi-domain
    service\n   forwarding for NSH. The proposed mechanism adopts a horizontal\n   deployment
    structure, which divides a multi-domain SFC into several\n   segmental SFCs in
    the control plane and each domain creates its own\n   SFP independently in data
    plane. A label is proposed to identify\n   different cross-domain flows at the
    classifier by extending the\n   metadata of the NSH encapsulation.\n\n\t </p>\n
