abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>According to the end to end argument, NAT function can completely
    and\ncorrectly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of end\nhosts.
    \ By making NAT visible to the end hosts of NAT clients and let\nthe hosts help
    NAT gateways, NAT actually becomes correct, complete,\nand end to end transparent.
    \ End to end NAT is upper compatible to\nlegacy NAT while enabling various transport
    protocols (ICMP, SCTP,\nIPSEC), DNS reverse look up, Multicast and Mobile IP.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
