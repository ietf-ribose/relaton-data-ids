abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the \"Connection ID\" concept for the
    Datagram\n   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, version 1.2 and version\n
    \  1.3.\n\n   A Connection ID is an identifier carried in the record layer header\n
    \  that gives the recipient additional information for selecting the\n   appropriate
    security association.  In \"classical\" DTLS, selecting a\n   security association
    of an incoming DTLS record is accomplished with\n   the help of the 5-tuple.  If
    the source IP address and/or source port\n   changes during the lifetime of an
    ongoing DTLS session then the\n   receiver will be unable to locate the correct
    security context.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
