abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.\n
    \  Participants frequently need to search and browse the archives of\n   these
    lists, and have asked for improved search capabilities.  The\n   current archive
    mechanism could also be made more efficient.  This\n   memo captures the requirements
    for improved email list archiving and\n   searching systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
