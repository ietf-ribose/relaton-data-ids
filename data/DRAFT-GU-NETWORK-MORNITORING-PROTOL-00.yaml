abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To enable automated network OAM (Operations, administration
    and\n   management), the availability of network protocol running status\n   information
    is a fundamental step.  In this document, a network\n   monitoring protocol (NMP)
    is proposed to provision the information\n   related to running status of IGP
    (Interior Gateway Protocol) and\n   other control protocols.  It can facilitate
    the network\n   troubleshooting of control protocols in a network domain.  Typical\n
    \  network issues are illustrated as the usecases of NMP for ISIS to\n   showcase
    the necessity of NMP.  Then the operations and the message\n   formats of NMP
    for ISIS are defined.  In this document ISIS is used\n   as the illustration protocol,
    and the case of OSPF and other control\n   protocols will be included in the future
    version.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
