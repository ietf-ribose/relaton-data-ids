abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking\n
    \  logic to elect single best path among multiple possible.  At the same\n   time,
    it has been common in all practical BGP implementations to\n   allow for \"equal-cost
    multipath\" (ECMP) path election and programming\n   of multiple next-hops in
    routing tables.  This documents provides\n   some common considerations for the
    ECMP logic, with the intent of\n   providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized
    feature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
