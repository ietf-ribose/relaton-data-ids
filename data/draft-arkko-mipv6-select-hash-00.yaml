abstract:
  content: "\t <t>MIPv6 is being defined with a security solution called ReturnRoutability
    (RR) that does not need any authentication infrastructure.Given that the solution
    is 'infrastructureless' in this manner, itisn't very easy to control the solution
    once it is widely deployed. Inparticular, it isn't clear how the solution could
    be changed to a newsolution, should that ever become necessary. Peers should be
    able toagree about the use the new solution in a secure manner, without Man-in-the-Middle
    attackers from being able to mount a Bidding Down attackand downgrade the security
    back to the original solution. This draftspecifies a simple but secure scheme
    which allows nodes to choose whatsecurity solution they use. One currently known
    drawback of thisscheme is that it is based on a technology that has IPR consideraÂ­tions.</p>"
