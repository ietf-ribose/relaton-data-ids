abstract:
- content: "<p>MIPv6 is being defined with a security solution called Return Routability
    (RR) that does not need any authentication infrastructure. Given that the solution
    is 'infrastructureless' in this manner, it isn't very easy to control the solution
    once it is widely deployed. In particular, it isn't clear how the solution could
    be changed to a new solution, should that ever become necessary. Peers should
    be able to agree about the use the new solution in a secure manner, without Man-
    in-the-Middle attackers from being able to mount a Bidding Down attack and downgrade
    the security back to the original solution. This draft specifies a simple but
    secure scheme which allows nodes to choose what security solution they use. One
    currently known drawback of this scheme is that it is based on a technology that
    has IPR consideraÂ­ tions.</p>"
