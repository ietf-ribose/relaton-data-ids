abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT devices are available from a number of vendors and are
    in use by\n   several residential and enterprise users.  Yet, there is much\n
    \  variation in how the NAT devices work.  Application developers,\n   network
    administrators and users of NAT devices seek some level of\n   uniformity and
    predictability in how various of the NAT devices\n   operate.  The objective of
    this document is to specify the\n   operational and behavioral requirements on
    the NAT devices while\n   processing TCP packets.  A NAT device that conforms
    to the\n   requirements listed in the document will bring predictability in how\n
    \  NATs operate with regard to TCP packet processing.  A NAT device is\n   said
    to be IETF behave compliant when it complies with the\n   requirements outlined
    in this document and other companion BEHAVE\n   documents like [BEH-UDP], which
    outlines the requirements for\n   processing UDP and some generic requirements.\n\t
