abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI),
    a network management protocol based on the gRPC framework. gNMI supports retrieval
    and manipulation of state from network elements where the data is represented
    by a tree structure, and addressable by paths. The gNMI service defines operations
    for configuration management, operational state retrieval, and bulk data collection
    via streaming telemetry. The authoritative gNMI specification is maintained at
    [GNMI-SPEC].</p>"
