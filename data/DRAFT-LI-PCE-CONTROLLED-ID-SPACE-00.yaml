abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing paths\n   in SR networks.\n\n   Stateful PCE provide
    active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a\n   model where the PCC delegates
    control over one or more locally\n   configured LSPs to the PCE.  Further, stateful
    PCE could also create\n   and delete PCE-initiated LSPs itself.  A PCE-based central
    controller\n   (PCECC) simplify the processing of a distributed control plane
    by\n   blending it with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and\n   without
    necessarily completely replacing it.\n\n   In some use cases, such as PCECC, Binding
    Segment Identifier (SID),\n   SR Path Identification, there is a requirement for
    a stateful PCE to\n   make allocation of labels, SID, Path-ID respectively.  These
    use\n   cases require for the PCE to be aware of the various identifier space\n
    \  from which to make allocations on behalf of PCC.  This documents\n   specify
    a mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier\n   space under its
    control via PCEP.  The identifier could be MPLS\n   label, SID, Path ID or another
    future identifier to be allocated by a\n   PCE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
