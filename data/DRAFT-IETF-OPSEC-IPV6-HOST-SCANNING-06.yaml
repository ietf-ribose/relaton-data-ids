abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n
    \  counterpart.  An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate\n   approximately
    1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower\n   host density (#hosts/#addresses)
    than is typical in IPv4 networks,\n   where a site typically has 65,000 or less
    unique addresses.  As a\n   result, it is widely assumed that it would take a
    tremendous effort\n   to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks,
    and\n   therefore brute-force IPv6 address scanning attacks have been\n   considered
    unfeasible.  This document updates RFC 5157, which first\n   discussed this assumption,
    by providing further analysis on how\n   traditional address scanning techniques
    apply to IPv6 networks, and\n   exploring some additional techniques that can
    be employed for IPv6\n   network reconnaissance.  In doing so, this document formally\n
    \  obsoletes RFC 5157.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
