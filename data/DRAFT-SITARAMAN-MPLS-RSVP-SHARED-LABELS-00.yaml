abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs has grown, various implementation\n
    \  recommendations have been proposed to manage control plane state.\n   However,
    the forwarding plane footprint of labels at a transit LSR\n   has remained proportional
    to the total LSP state in the control\n   plane.  This draft defines a mechanism
    to prevent the label space\n   limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control
    plane scaling on\n   that node.  It introduces the notion of pre-installed per
    TE link\n   'pop labels' that are shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these\n
    \  links and thus significantly reducing the forwarding plane state\n   required.
    \ This couples the feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control\n   plane with the
    simplicity of the Segment Routing MPLS forwarding\n   plane.  This document also
    introduces the ability to mix different\n   types of label operations along the
    path of the LSP, thereby allowing\n   the ingress or an external controller to
    influence how to optimally\n   place a LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
