abstract:
  content: "<p>This document recommends IPv6 behavior for Customer PremisesEquipment
    (CPE) routers in Internet-enabled homes and small offices.The CPE Router may be
    a standalone device. The CPE Router may alsobe embedded in a device such as a
    cable modem, DSL modem, cellularphone, etc. This document describes the router
    portion of such adevice. The purpose behind this document is to provide minimalfunctionality
    for interoperability and create consistency in thecustomer experience and satisfy
    customer expectations for the device.Further, the document also provide some guidance
    for implementers toexpedite availability of IPv6 CPE router products in the marketplace.It
    is expected that standards bodies other than the IETF developingstandards for
    specific products in this area (e.g. CableLabseRouter, DSL Forum, Home Gateway
    Initiative, etc.) may reference thiswork for basic functionality and provide value-added
    or linktype-specific customizations and enhancements which are beyond the scopeof
    this document.</p>"
