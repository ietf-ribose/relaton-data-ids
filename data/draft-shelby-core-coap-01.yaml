abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),a
    specialized transfer protocol for use with constrained networks andnodes for machine-to-machine
    applications such as smart energy andbuilding automation. These constrained nodes
    often have 8-bitmicrocontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while networkssuch
    as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and typicalthroughput of 10s of
    kbps. CoAP provides request/reply andsubscribe/notify interaction models between
    appliciation end-points,supports built-in resource discovery, and includes key
    web conceptssuch as URIs and RESTful methods. CoAP easily translates to HTTP forintegration
    with the web while meeting specialized requirements suchas multicast support,
    very low overhead and simplicity forconstrained environments.</p>"
