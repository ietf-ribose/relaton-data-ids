    circuit types in link state routing protocol, and highlights it is important to
    identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link state
    database packets, and monitor the link state. P2P Interface over LAN ifType value
    is assigned by IANA experts review. This document provides an example of the ifStack
    for P2P Interface over LAN ifType to facilitate operational control, maintenance
    and statistics.</p>"
