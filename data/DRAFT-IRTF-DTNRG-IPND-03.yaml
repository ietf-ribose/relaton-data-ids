abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) IP Neighbor Discovery
    (IPND), is\n   a method for otherwise oblivious nodes to learn of the existence,\n
    \  availability, and addresses of other DTN participants.  IPND both\n   sends
    and listens for small IP UDP announcement \"beacons.\"  Beacon\n   messages are
    addressed to an IP unicast, multicast, or broadcast\n   destination to discover
    specified or unspecified remote neighbors, or\n   unspecified local neighbors
    in the topology, e.g. within wireless\n   range.  IPND beacons advertise neighbor
    availability by including the\n   DTN node's canonical endpoint identifier.  IPND
    beacons optionally\n   include service availability and parameters.  In this way,
    neighbor\n   discovery and service discovery may be coupled or decoupled as\n
    \  required.  Once discovered, new neighbor pairs use advertised\n   availabilities
    to connect, exchange routing information, etc.  This\n   document describes DTN
    IPND.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
