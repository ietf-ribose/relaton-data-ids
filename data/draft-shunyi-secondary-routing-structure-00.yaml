abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a dynamic secondary routing structure with
    the destination address and subnet mask as the first index and DSCP value as the
    second. DSCP values of various applications are extracted and packets are forwarded
    in accordance with them. Therefore, applications with different demands of Quality
    of Service (QoS) can be served accordingly, which can promote the quality of transmission
    and finally achieve differentiated services.</p>"
