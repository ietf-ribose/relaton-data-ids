abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a QoS PIF MIB (Quality-of-ServiceProgramming-Interface
    Management-Information-Base) to be used as anSNMP-based programming interface
    for routers. This MIB is intendedto be a programming interface for router QoS
    functions, especiallyDiffServ-related [RFC2475] functions including packet scheduling(queuing),
    dropping, and metering that must be modular and conciselydescribed. Traffic-conditioning
    rules and metering rules forDiffServ-related functions are defined modularly by
    using 'virtualflow labels' and exclusive conditions in rules, and newclassifications
    for packet-scheduling and packet-dropping functionsare introduced. This document
    focuses on satisfying the requirementson programming interfaces or programming
    languages for routercontrol. Thus, the focus is different from that of DiffServ
    MIB[DSMIB] or QoS PIB [QoSPIB].</p>"
