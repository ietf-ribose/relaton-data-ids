abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document specifies procedure for sending and processing probe query and response
    messages for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure
    uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
    Light) and its extensions for Performance Measurement. The procedure specified
    is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both Links and end-to-end
    SR Paths including SR Policies.</p>"
