abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on the integration of FEC coding in the QUIC
    transport protocol, in order to recover from packet losses. This document does
    not specify any FEC code but defines mechanisms to negotiate and integrate FEC
    Schemes in QUIC. By using proactive loss recovery, it is expected to improve QUIC
    performance in sessions impacted by packet losses. More precisely it is expected
    to improve QUIC performance with real-time sessions (since FEC coding makes packet
    loss recovery insensitive to the round trip time), with short sessions (since
    FEC coding can help recovering from tail losses more rapidely than through retransmissions),
    with multicast sessions (since the same repair packet can recover several different
    losses at several receivers), and with multipath sessions (since repair packets
    add diversity and flexibility).</p>"
