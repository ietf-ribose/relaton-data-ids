abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT)
    and\n   constrained environments that do not require confidentiality, though\n
    \  message integrity for all communications and at least server, if not\n   mutual
    authentication during tunnel establishment, are both still\n   mandated.  This
    document gives examples of such use cases, although a\n   threat model is necessary
    to determine whether or not a given\n   situation falls into this category of
    use cases.  In order to serve\n   these use cases, this document defines the use
    of HMAC-only cipher\n   suites for TLS 1.3, which provides server and optionally
    mutual\n   authentication and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.\n
    \  The approach described in this document is not endorsed by the IETF\n   and
    does not have IETF consensus, but is presented here to enable\n   interoperable
    implementation of a reduced security mechanism that\n   provides authentication
    and message integrity without supporting\n   confidentiality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
