abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With emergence of Internet of Things(IoT), DTLS is being widely\n
    \  considered as a protocol of choice for communication security in IoT\n   applications.
    Further, AES_CCM has emerged as the cipher of choice in\n   constrained environments.
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),\n   which is the application layer protocol
    for resource constrained\n   environments, mandates DTLS as underlying security
    protocol and\n   proposes AES_CCM based ciphers to be used with different key
    exchange\n   methods. AEAD ciphers requires an explicit nonce of 8 bytes must
    be\n   carried in each transmitted record.This document defines a TLS (and\n   DTLS)
    extension, which will allow clients and servers to omit the\n   explicit nonce
    sent in TLS/DTLS records.  This document can be\n   considered as an extended
    version of \"Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   Extensions : Extension Definitions\".
    The extension defined in this\n   document apply equally to both DTLS and TLS
    protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
