abstract:
- content: "<p>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly deployed
    IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been proposed. One such mechanism
    is configured tunnels. This document provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6
    servers can provide information about the various configured tunnel end points
    to reach the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.</p>"
