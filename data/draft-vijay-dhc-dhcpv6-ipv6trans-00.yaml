  content: "<p>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastlydeployed
    IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had beenproposed. One such mechanism

    can provideinformation about the various configured tunnel end points to reachthe
    IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.</p>"
