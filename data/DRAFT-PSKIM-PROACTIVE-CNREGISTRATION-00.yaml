abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document, a proactive correspondent registration mechanism
    \nis proposed for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) route optimization \nbetween
    the correspondent node (CN) and the mobile access gateway \n(MAG) on behalf of
    the mobile node (MN). Two scenarios are \nconsidered according to the type of
    CN. For the proposed mechanism, \nthe proxy home test and the concurrent care-of
    test are defined \nnewly with parameters specified by information on candidate
    MAGs. \nThe proposed correspondent registration mechanism is performed \nbefore
    actual handover for candidate MAGs where the MN can attach\nnewly. Therefore,
    the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent \nregistration latency, which
    can reduce handover latency and thus \nenhance throughput degradation caused by
    the bidirectional tunneling\nvia the local mobility anchor (LMA).\n\t </p>\n      "
