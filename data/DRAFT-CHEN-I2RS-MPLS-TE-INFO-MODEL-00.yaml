abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditionally MPLS TE networks may be managed via CLI, SNMP
    or\n   NETCONF.  There are two types of TE LSP: static CR-LSP and dynamic TE\n
    \  LSP created by protocol of RSVP-TE.  Static CR-LSP is configured with\n   forwarding
    items such as interface, label and bandwidth, etc. node by\n   node.  Dynamic
    TE LSP is configured with MPLS TE parameters which are\n   used to calculate path
    and set up TE LSP by protocol.  Both\n   configurations are complex.\n\n   The
    Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interface\n   (draft-ietf-i2rs-architecture)
    provides an alternate way to control\n   the configuration and diagnose the operation
    of MPLS TE.  These\n   interactions to control MPLS TE links and diagnose their
    operation\n   include: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE protection, traffic\n   switching-over,
    traffic detection, and fault detection.\n\n   This document specifies an information
    model for MPLS TE to\n   facilitate the definition of a standardized data model
    which can be\n   used to define interfaces to the MPLS TE from an entity that
    may even\n   be external to the routing system.  Based on standardized data model\n
    \  and interfaces, use cases of MPLS TE defined by draft-huang-i2rs-\n   mpls-te-usecases
    can be supported.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
