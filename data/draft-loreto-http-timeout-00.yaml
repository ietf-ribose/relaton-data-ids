abstract:
  content: "<p>A Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).This
    end-to-end header informs an origin server and anyintermediaries of the maximum
    time that a client will await aresponse to its request. A server can use this
    header to ensure thata timely response is generated. This also identifies requests
    asbeing potentially long-lived, and allows for better resourceallocation for these
    requests.A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hopheader
    informs the entity at the other end of a connection of themaximum time that an
    idle connection is kept open. This headerimproves reliability by providing better
    information about the idleconnection management policy of HTTP hosts.Comments
    and feedback for this draft should be directed to theauthors and the Apps Discuss
    list (discuss@apps.ietf.org).</p>"
