abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Efforts are currently being undertaken to review the role of Whois
    \n(as defined in RFC 954 [2] and formalize registry/registrar \ncommunications
    protocols in light of the current and evolving scope \nand utility of DNS, domain
    name registries and related entities. In \norder for this work to be truly effective
    and broadly applicable, it \nis important that accepted definitions act as the
    foundation. This \ndocument is an attempt to create a starting point for the requisite
    \ndialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and \nacceptance of these
    definitions.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
