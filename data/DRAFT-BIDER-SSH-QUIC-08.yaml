abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for
    purposes\n   including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP
    and\n   SCP, and encrypted tunneling of TCP connections.  Because it is based\n
    \  on TCP, SSH suffers similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to\n   transition
    to UDP-based QUIC [QUIC].  These include: unauthenticated\n   network intermediaries
    can trivially disconnect SSH sessions; SSH\n   connections are lost when mobile
    clients change IP addresses;\n   performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks;
    many round-trips to\n   establish a connection; duplicate flow control on the
    level of the\n   connection as well as channels.  This memo specifies SSH key
    exchange\n   over UDP and leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based transport.\n\n\t
