abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses a network side solution of fast handover
    in \nMobile IPv6. Existing FMIPv6 basically assumes the involvement of \nmobile
    nodes in handover procedure. However, in some cases, it may not \nbe easy to realize
    fast handover function into all mobile nodes. In \nthe case, a network operator
    may want to provide fast handover service         \nto users by using only networks
    entities. To achieve network side fast \nhandover, this document basically uses
    bi-directional tunnel between a \nprevious access router and new access router.
    The proposed fast \nhandover scheme has simpler procedure than the existing FMIPv6
    and             \nmostly uses the existing messages. \n\t </p>\n      "
