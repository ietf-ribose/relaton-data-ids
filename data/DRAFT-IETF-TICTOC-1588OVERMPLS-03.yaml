abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages\n
    \  such as PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the\n   easy
    identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port\n   level processing
    of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs.\n\n   The basic idea is to transport Timing
    messages inside dedicated MPLS\n   LSPs.  These LSPs only carry timing messages
    and possibly Control and\n   Management packets, but they do not carry customer
    traffic.\n\n   Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.\n
    \  The first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the\n   dedicated
    MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for\n   MPLS networks.  The
    second method is to transport Timing messages\n   inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation,
    which is suitable for both\n   MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
