abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of internetworks\nbuilt
    using the Border Gateway Protocol to provide routing\ninformation to autonomous
    systems connected to the internetwork.\nThis draft provides an architecture for
    a secure distributed registry\nof routing information to address these concerns.
    \ The draft begins\nwith an overview of the operation of this system, and then
    follows\nwith various deployment scenarios, starting with what we believe will\nbe
    the most common deployment option.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
