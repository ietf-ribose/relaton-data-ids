abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes operational guidelines for devices
    and\n   software which implement fax-over-SMTP [SERVICE].\n \n   An device which
    implements [SERVICE] and this document will be able\n   to exchange capabilities,
    confirm message receipt, perform immediate\n   delivery, and determine the length
    of a call.\n \n   Additionally, some guidelines are introduced to allow for new\n
    \  functions to be added without breaking older implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n
