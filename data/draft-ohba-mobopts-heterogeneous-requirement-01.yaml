abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the problem statement and a set of issues andrequirement
    specific to heterogeneous handover. Carefulconsideration needs to be given to
    these set of requirements whiledesigning an optimized handover framework in a
    heterogeneous mobilityscenario. These problem statements help determine the key
    functionsthat are responsible for delay during handover involving interdomainand
    heterogeneous access technology. Analysis of these issues andrequirements can
    be applied to any existing mobility optimizationframework.</p>"
