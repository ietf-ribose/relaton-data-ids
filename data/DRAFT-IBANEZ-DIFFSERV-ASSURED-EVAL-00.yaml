abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service,
    an end-to-end\nservice based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP.
    Assured\nService has been the subject of much discussion in the past year in the
    IETF,\nbut solid information on its applicability to the entire Internet has been\nlacking.
    This report is aimed at providing a first step in this direction.\nAssured Service
    requires an active queue management algorithm with preferential\npacket drop.
    The RIO algorithm (an extension of the RED algorithm) has been\nthe primary method
    suggested and is the one evaluated here. Our results show\nthat Assured Service
    does not provide clearly defined and consistent rate\nguarantees; the advantage
    gained by connections using Assured Service is not\na quantifiable one. Further
    work would be required to determine an appropriate\nuse of the Assured Service.
    A pdf version of this document is available and\nrecommended for the figures it
    contains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
