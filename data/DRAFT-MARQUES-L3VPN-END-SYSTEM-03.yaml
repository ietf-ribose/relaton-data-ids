abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Service Providers often use BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364]
    as the\n   control plane for overlay networks.  That solution has proven to\n
    \  scale to large number of VPNs and attachment points and is one\n   familiar
    to network equipment software.\n\n   There is a significant interest in the industry
    in building overlay\n   networks in which end-systems are themselves the direct
    participant,\n   along with network equipment such as service appliances.\n\n
    \  This document proposes an extension of the BGP IP VPN model to serve\n   as
    the signaling protocol for host-based overlay networks along with\n   an XMPP
    interface that provides a bridge between the software\n   concepts familiar to
    end-points and those familiar to network\n   equipment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
