abstract:
- content: "<p>The latest version of Multicast Listener Discovery protocol is defined
    in RFC 3810, dated back in 2004, while the first version of MLD, which is still
    in use and has not been deprecated, is defined in RFC 2710 and is dated back in
    1999. New security research has exhibited new vulnerabilities in MLD, both remote
    and local attack vectors. This document describes those vulnerabilities and proposes
    specific mitigation techniques.</p>"
