abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile IPv6, when a Mobile Node (MN) moves from one Access Router(AR)
    to another, there is a period during which the MN is unable to send or receive
    packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations. This document
    specifies a mechanism to reduce packet loss through a Home Agent (HA) buffering
    downlink packets during the handover period.</p>"
