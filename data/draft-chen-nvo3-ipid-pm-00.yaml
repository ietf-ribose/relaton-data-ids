abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Identification(IPID)is a field in IP header primarily used to uniquely
    identify the group of fragments of a single IP packet. The value of IPID field
    in a packet from a specific traffic flow or source IP address keeps increasing
    until wrapped-around. This document specifies a method by carefully examining
    IPID value to monitor the performance of VXLAN network. In this memo packet loss
    measurement is mainly considered. This method requires no extra hardware support,
    which means it is compatible with most of the deployed routers or switches. Such
    a mechanism is applicable to IPv4 network and potential useful in overlay network
    with different data encapsulation.</p>"
