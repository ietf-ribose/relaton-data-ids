abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a HTTP authentication scheme using PPP
    \n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  \n\nHTTP EAP authentication enables
    HTTP connections to be authenticated \n\nusing any of the authentication schemes
    supported through EAP. EAP \n\nperforms the authentication without sending the
    password in the \n\nclear text format (which is the biggest weakness of the Basic
    HTTP \n\nauthentication scheme, for example).  \n\nEAP is useful for HTTP protocol
    because it opens up several new \n\nauthentication schemes without additional
    specification work. The \n\nsame benefits can be reached by any other protocols,
    which apply \n\nHTTP authentication, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n\t
    </p>\n      "
