abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The growth in mobile terminal access to the Internet has been
    one of \nthe greatest growth areas in the past year. Indeed the so-called 3rd
    \ngeneration mobile networks being designed are premised upon Internet \nservices
    and protocols. Both mobility and wireless access bring with \nthem unique requirements
    that needs to be addressed within the \nInternet community such as address space
    and limited access \nbandwidth. This document is a synthesis of a yearlong study
    of \nmobile operators and mobile ISPs to crystallise these unique \nrequirements.
    These are provided for guidance and are not intended \nto be prescriptive on the
    current Internet Architectural Framework.\n\t </p>\n      "
