abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, a mechanism to grasp the network situation is
    proposed\n   for improving end-to-end path throughput. The proposed mechanism
    is\n   based on the active packet-train probing based estimation. The\n   proposed
    mechanism defines three cases of the difference between the\n   average output
    gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them.\n   Since three cases are
    handled respectively by appropriate\n   corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism
    can be expected to\n   reduce the detection error for the turning point. Therefore,
    through\n   the proposed mechanism, the available bandwidth can be estimated more\n
    \  reliably.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
