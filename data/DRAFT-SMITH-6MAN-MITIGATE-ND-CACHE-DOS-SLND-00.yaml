abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulernable to a Denial
    of\n   Service attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the\n   neighbor
    discovery address resolution process.  This can be very\n   disruptive when a
    router is successfully attacked.\n\n   This memo proposes a stateless form of
    neighbor discovery to be used\n   by routers to eliminate the opportunity for
    this DoS attack.  This\n   method of stateless neighbor discovery would be used
    for unknown or\n   untrusted packet sources, when the router's neighbor cache's
    state\n   capacity reaches a medium to high threshold of use.  Trusted packet\n
    \  sources would continue to be provided with traditional stateful\n   neighbor
    discovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
