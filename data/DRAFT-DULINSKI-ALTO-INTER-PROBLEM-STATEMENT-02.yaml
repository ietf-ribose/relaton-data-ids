abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    has been\n   standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection\n
    \  management.  Due to various reasons, optimization capabilities of\n   ALTO
    servers are limited by the fact that it may not be possible for\n   an ALTO server
    to compute costs for source/destination pairs\n   correctly if a source and/or
    a destination is outside the\n   administrative domain it belongs to.  In other
    words, an ALTO server\n   may be generally unable to optimize the traffic with
    only locally\n   available topology information.\n\n   Therefore, it is proposed
    that operators of distinct administrative\n   domains may agree on topology- and
    policy-related information\n   exchange through a standardized inter-ALTO communication
    framework.\n   This document provides a rationale for design, standardization,
    and\n   implementation of the inter-ALTO communication framework.\n\n\t </p>\n
