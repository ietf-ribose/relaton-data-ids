abstract:
  content: "<p>IPv6 Multihoming design help host(s) in a site to switch dynamicallybetween
    multiple attached global internet without impactingtransport and application layer
    protocol whenever failure occur.Basic issue on this design when ipv-to-ipv6 Network
    prefixtranslations not being used are:-1. Source addresses selection, 2. Next
    hop selection and3. DNS resolution.Even though Ipv6-to-Ipv6 Network prefix translation
    (NPTv6) solveabove mention problems, NPTv6 not ideal as it's not achieveEnd-to-End
    transparency of connectivity .Alternatively by usingpolicy at End host to select
    source address and next hop alsosolve above mention issues.This document proposes
    solution which defines how automatically apolicy can be enforced on host by first
    hop router using routeradvertisement. That's reduced administrative effort of
    updating policyon all hosts in site. This document not obsolete any of the previouswork,
    only propose how policy on End-host can be enforce from routerby mapping destination
    prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.</p>"
