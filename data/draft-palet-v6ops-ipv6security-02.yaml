abstract:
- content: "<p>The security policies currently applied in Internet with IPv4, doesnâ€™t
    longer apply for end-to-end security models which IPv6 will enable. Today, each
    network is often secured by a unique device (i.e. security gateway or firewall),
    that becomes a bottleneck for the end- to-end security model with IPv6. In addition,
    users and devices start to be nomadic, moving between different networks that
    could have different security policies. A distributed and dynamic approach is
    consequently required, as already described by [1].</p>"
