abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the requirements of an application layer\nprotocol
    for Discovery Services.  Discovery Services at its core\noffers to authenticated
    and authorized users the means to discover\nresources of information for a particular
    identifier.  The\ninformation resource can be any data source which provides an\ninterface
    on a network that allows for retrieval of the data.  An\ninformation resource
    could publish its network address (reference to\nthe resource) to a Discovery
    Service coupled with an identifier.\nThen an authenticated and authorized user
    could query the Discovery\nService with the same identifier to receive reference
    information to\nthe resources.  Interfacing with the resources for actually\nretrieving
    the data is out of scope of Discovery Services; the role\nof Discovery Services
    is to enable a client to find the network\naddresses and types (e.g.  URLs) of
    information resources for a\nparticular identifier of interest.\n\nThis protocol
    is applicable to numerous scenarios such as track and\ntrace in trade supply chains,
    where a number of independent resources\nmay hold information about a particular
    object and may have an\ninterest in selective sharing of that information, in
    order to\nimprove the efficiency of the supply chain network.\n\nHowever, other
    applications can be envisaged, as a 'bottom-up' or\n'grassroots' way for generators
    of information content to: 1) declare\nthat they have information or commentary
    on a particular topic or\nsubject (which might be a physical object, geographic
    location or\neven an abstract concept) 2) specify a network address through which\nthat
    content can be retrieved, 3) specify restrictions about the\ncommunity of clients
    that are entitled to receive knowledge about the\nexistence of their content or
    see the link.  This approach can be\ncontrasted with the top-down approach of
    existing web search engines\nthat rely on crawling/spidering of content that must
    be already\nposted in the public domain before it can be indexed - and where the\nlink
    information is generally made publicly available in a manner\nthat does not discriminate
    between clients on an individual basis.\n\nThis document outlines a set of design
    concerns that an application\nlayer protocol needs to address in order to be widely
    adopted and\ndeployable on public networks\n\nThis document obsoletes \"Extensible
    Supply-chain Discovery Service\nProblem Statement draft-rezafard-esds-problem-statement-02\".\n\nComments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at\nesds@ietf.org and/or
    the author(s).\n\t </p>\n      "
