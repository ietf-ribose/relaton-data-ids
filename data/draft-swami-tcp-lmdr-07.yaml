abstract:
  content: "<p>TCP congestion control is based on the assumption that the end-to-endpath
    of a connection changes only insignificantly after connectionestablishment. Network
    layer mobility protocols that change aconnection's point of attachment transparently
    to the transport layermay violate this assumption and cause TCP to make congestion
    controldecisions based on invalid information. This document describes aTCP option
    that allows a connection endpoint to inform a peer when itchanges location. This
    document also outlines the proper congestioncontrol behavior that should take
    place in the face of such networklayer mobility.</p>"
