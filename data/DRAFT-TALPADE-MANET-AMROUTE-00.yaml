abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Adhoc Multicast Routing Protocol (AMRoute) allows for robust
    IP\nMulticast in mobile adhoc networks by exploiting user-multicast trees and\ndynamic
    cores.  It creates a bidirectional shared-tree for data\ndistribution using only
    the group senders and receivers as tree nodes.\nUnicast tunnels are used as the
    tree links to connect neighbors on the\n'user-multicast tree.' Thus, AMRoute does
    not need to be supported by\nnetwork nodes that are not interested/capable of
    multicast, and cost is\nincurred only by group senders and receivers.  AMRoute
    makes certain nodes\n'core nodes' to initiate the signaling component of AMRoute,
    such as\ndetection of group members and tree setup.  Core nodes differ significantly\nfrom
    those in CBT and PIM-SM, since they are not a central point for data\ndistribution
    and can move dynamically among member nodes.  Since AMRoute is\nnot dependent
    on any specific unicast routing protocol, it can operate\nseamlessly over separate
    domains with different unicast protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
