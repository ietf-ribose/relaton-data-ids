abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving
    global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements because an IPv4 NAPT
    router implements three functions: source address selection, next-hop resolution,
    and (optionally) DNS resolution. For IPv6 hosts, one approach could be the use
    of IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6). However, NAT and NPTv6 should
    be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-end connectivity.
    In this document, we analyze the use cases of multihoming. We also describe functional
    requirements and possible solutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in
    IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet
    minimum IPv6-allocation criteria. We conclude that DHCPv6-based solutions are
    suitable to solve the multihoming issues described in this document, but NPTv6
    may be required as an intermediate solution.</p>"
