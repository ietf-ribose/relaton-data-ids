abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] provides a way by which
    the\nnodes can determine whether to use administered protocol for address\nautoconfiguration
    and other non-address information through M and O\nbits in the Router Advertisements.
    \ Though RAs can notify nodes of a\nchange in the address prefixes, currently
    there is no way the nodes\ncan learn that there is a change in the non-address
    configuration\nparameters.  This will make the nodes unable to learn about new
    or\nchanged configuration parameters like DNS server addresses.  This\nspecification
    extends the Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC2461] to\nnotify the nodes that the
    other information obtained through an\nadministered protocol has been changed.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
