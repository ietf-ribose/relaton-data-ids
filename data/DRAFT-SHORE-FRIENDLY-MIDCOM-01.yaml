abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While IP was designed around the notion that the network would
    be\ninvisible to the applications that run on them, an increasingly\ncomplex service
    environment along with the compartmentalization of\n'policy' into administrative
    domains has led to a proliferation of\ntypes of middleboxes for policy enforcement,
    and those middleboxes\nare interfering with applications.  Applications now need
    to influ-\nence the behavior of middleboxes, but violating network layering\nprinciples
    by establishing explicit communication channels from\napplications to network-layer
    middleboxes introduces a new set of\nproblems related to topology and discovery
    as well as consequent\nproblems that ripple out from those.  This paper is an
    introductory\nexamination of whether or not there is a better way.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
