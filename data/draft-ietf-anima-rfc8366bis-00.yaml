abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an owner
    using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the pledge's manufacturer.
    This artifact is known as a "voucher". This document defines an artifact format
    as a YANG-defined JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS) structure. Other YANG-derived formats are possible. The voucher artifact
    is normally generated by the pledge's manufacturer (i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized
    Signing Authority (MASA)). This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving
    it to other documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.</p>
