abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To evolve towards automated network OAM (Operations, administration\n
    \  and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a\n   fundamental
    necessity.  This document proposes network monitoring for\n   IGP to facilitate
    troubleshooting by collecting the IGP monitoring\n   data and reporting it to
    the network monitoring server in real-time.\n   In this document, the operations
    of network monitoring for ISIS are\n   described, and the corresponding network
    monitoring message types and\n   message formats are defined.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
