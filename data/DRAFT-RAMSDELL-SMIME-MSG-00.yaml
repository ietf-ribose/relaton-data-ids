abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides
    a\nconsistent way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the\npopular
    Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following\ncryptographic security
    services for electronic messaging applications:\nauthentication, message integrity
    and non-repudiation of origin (using\ndigital signatures) and privacy and data
    security (using encryption).\n \nS/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents
    (MUAs) to add\ncryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret\ncryptographic
    security services in mail that is received. However,\nS/MIME is not restricted
    to mail; it can be used with any transport\nmechanism that transports MIME data,
    such as HTTP. As such, S/MIME\ntakes advantage of the object-based features of
    MIME and allows secure\nmessages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems.\n
    \nFurther, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that\nuse cryptographic
    security services that do not require any human\nintervention, such as the signing
    of software-generated documents and\nthe encryption of FAX messages sent over
    the Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
