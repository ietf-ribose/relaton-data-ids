abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) architecture, an SDN\n
    \  controller decides and establishes flow paths.  As an SDN controller\n   provides
    control plane functions by communicating with switches, the\n   latency of control
    functions is an important issue.  Source routing\n   is applicable to improve
    the performance of SDN.  In this document,\n   we illustrate SDN source routing
    use cases of flow setup and failure\n   recovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
