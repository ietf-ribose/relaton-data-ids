abstract:
  content: "<p>Although JSON has become a popular choice of the web services response
    that tries to be REST like, the lack of its capability to express the hyperlink
    and other metadata in a standardized manner has been felt. This document proposes
    a method to minimally represent such metadata that can be inserted into the existing
    JSON responses to express such metadata.</p>"
