abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      Cross-realm operations in Kerberos allow users to access
    services\n   offered by foreign realms.  The cross-realm operations are based
    on\n   inter-realm trust built using shared symmetric keys (aka. inter-realm\n
    \  keys) between the KDCs of the realms offering cross-realm services.\n   The
    current cross-realm authentication model may be the origin of\n   performance,
    scalability and security issues.  This documents\n   provides a brief overview
    of these issues and introduces a new cross-\n   realm model based on PKINIT.  The
    new model called XTGSP, defines a\n   protocol that allows a client to obtain
    a service ticket, for a\n   service offered by a foreign realm, in a single round
    trip.  The\n   protocol specifies an exchange between Kerberos KDCs that enables
    a\n   local KDC to build a TGS-REP message for a service that is registered\n
    \  in a remote realm.  The XTGSP exchange is secured using inter-realm\n   keys
    maintained using the the PKINIT extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
