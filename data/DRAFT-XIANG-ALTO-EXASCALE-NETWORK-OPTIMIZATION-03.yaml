abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain,\n
    \  geographically-distributed, collaborative computing, where different\n   organizations
    contribute various resources to collaboratively\n   collect, share and analyze
    extremely large amounts of data.  Examples\n   of this paradigm include the Compact
    Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A\n   Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the
    Large Hadron\n   Collider (LHC) program.  Massive datasets continue to be acquired,\n
    \  simulated, processed and analyzed by globally distributed science\n   networks
    in these collaborations.  Applications that manage and\n   analyze such massive
    data volumes can benefit substantially from the\n   information about networking,
    computing and storage resources from\n   each member's site, and more directly
    from network-resident services\n   that optimize and load balance resource usage
    among multiple data\n   transfers and analytics requests, and achieve a better
    utilization of\n   multiple resources in clusters.\n\n   The Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can\n   provide via extensions the network
    information about different\n   clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network
    management\n   services where applicable, with the goal of improving both\n   application
    performance and network resource utilization.  In this\n   document, we propose
    that it is feasible to use existing ALTO\n   services to provides not only network
    information, but also\n   information about computation and storage resources
    in data analytics\n   networks.  We introduce a uniform resource orchestration
    framework\n   (Unicorn), which achieves an efficient multi-resource allocation
    to\n   support low-latency dataset transfer and data intensive analytics for\n
    \  collaborative computing.  It collects cluster information from\n   multiple
    ALTO services utilizing topology extensions and leverages\n   emerging SDN control
    capabilities to orchestrate the resource\n   allocation for dataset transfers
    and analytics tasks, leading to\n   improved transfer and analytics latency as
    well as more efficient\n   utilization of multi-resources in sites.\n\n\t </p>\n
