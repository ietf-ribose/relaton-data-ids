abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node as
    the\nmobile node changes its point of attachment to the Internet.\nHowever, it
    is also required to provide proper QoS forwarding\ntreatment to mobile node's
    packet stream at the intermediate nodes\nin the network, so that QoS-sensitive
    IP services can be supported\nover Mobile IP. This document describes requirements
    for an IP QoS\nmechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.\n\t </p>\n
