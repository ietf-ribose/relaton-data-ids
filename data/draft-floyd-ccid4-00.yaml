abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP
    [TFRC-SP], a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC designed for applications that
    send small packets. The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth
    in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing
    the same level of congestion. CCID 4 is for experimental use for senders that
    send small packets and would like a TCP-friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.</p>"
