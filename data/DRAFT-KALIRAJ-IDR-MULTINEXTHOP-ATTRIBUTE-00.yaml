abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, a BGP speaker can advertise one nexthop for a set of
    NLRIs in\n   an Update.  This nexthop can be encoded in either the BGP-Nexthop\n
    \  attribute (code 3), or inside the MP_REACH attribute (code 14).\n\n   For cases
    where multiple nexthops need to be advertised, BGP-Addpath\n   is used.  Though
    Addpath allows basic ability to advertise multiple-\n   nexthops, it does not
    allow the sender to specify desired\n   relationship between the multiple nexthops
    being advertised e.g.,\n   relative-preference, type of load-balancing.  These
    are local\n   decisions at the receiving speaker based on path-selection between\n
    \  the various additional-paths, which may tie-break on some arbitrary\n   step
    like Router-Id.\n\n   Some scenarios with a BGP-free core may benefit from having
    a\n   mechanism, where egress-node can signal multiple-nexthops along with\n   their
    relationship to ingress nodes.  This document defines a new BGP\n   attribute
    \"MultiNexthop\" that can be used for this purpose.\n\n   This attribute can be
    used for both labeled and unlabled BGP\n   families.  For labeled-families, it
    is used for a different purpose\n   in \"downstream allocation\" case than \"upstream
    allocation\" scenarios.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
