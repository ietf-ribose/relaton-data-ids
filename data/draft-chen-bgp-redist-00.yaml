abstract:
  content: "<p>In this document we propose an enhancement to the BGP route selection
    algorithm that would make the interaction of redistributed routes and other BGP
    routes deterministic, thus facilitating the deployment of various routing requirements.
    The proposed enhancement is backward compatible.</p>"
