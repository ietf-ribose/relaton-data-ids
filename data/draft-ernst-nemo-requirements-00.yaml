abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuousInternet
    connectivity to mobile hosts only (host mobility support).In contrast, network
    mobility support (NEMO support) deals withsituations where an entire network changes
    its point of attachment tothe Internet and thus its reachability in the topology.
    In thissituation, mobility support is to provide continuous Internetsessions not
    only to the router connecting the mobile network to theglobal Internet, but also
    to nodes behind the mobile router. Thisdocument tries to identify what constraints
    limit the implementationand the deployment of a potentially and ideally good solution,
    andwhat requirements solutions must comply with. Our main aim is toraise the discussion
    on the mailing list.</p>"
