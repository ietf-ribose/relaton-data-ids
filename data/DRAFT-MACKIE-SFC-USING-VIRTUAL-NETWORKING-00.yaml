abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can
    be\n   applied to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay)\n   network
    to steer traffic between service nodes. Chains can include\n   services running
    in routers, on physical appliances or in virtual\n   machines. Service chains
    have applicability at the subscriber edge,\n   business edge and in multi-tenant
    datacenters. The routing function\n   into SFCs and between service functions
    within an SFC can be\n   performed by physical devices (routers), be virtualized
    inside\n   hypervisors, or run as part of a host OS.\n\n   The architecture uses
    a controller to calculate and install routes\n   to implement an SFC, based on
    a topological model of the chain and\n   knowledge of the network addresses that
    should pass through the\n   chain. An advantage of the approach is that SFCs can
    be implemented\n   without alteration to today's BGP standard, and without change
    to\n   the current operation of routers.\n\n   Service chains need to support
    load balancing between network\n   functions, and symmetric forward and reverse
    paths are required when\n   stateful services are involved. This document shows
    how these\n   requirements can be met by using VRFs at the ingress and egress
    of\n   each service instance and by performing load balancing after the\n   egress
    of each service as part of the routing function.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
