abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In this draft, we propose requirement to implement MPLS technologyfor
    Ethernet switched network. Ethernet has become major buildingblock in local area
    network and the area of deployment is quicklyexpanding to core network. While
    there have been industry needs toovercome weakness of Ethernet, MPLS has not been
    considered as keytechnology to improve Ethernet. Currently MPLS [RFC3031] and
    GMPLS[GARCH] architecture do not define label-switching function onL2SC interface,
    i.e. over LAN media. Hence, it is necessary todiscuss lightweight implementation
    of MPLS for Ethernet. Sincethere is disparity in requirements depending on hierarchy
    of Ethernet,it is appropriate to separate discussion in Customer Premise Network(CPN),
    Access Network (AN) and Core Network (CN). Some candidate methods to consider
    for label encoding for Ethernet are discussed.</p>"
