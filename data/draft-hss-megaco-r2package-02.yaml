abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a R2 package in association with the MEGACO Protocol
    that can be used to control a Media Gateway (MG) from an external controller,
    called a Media Gateway controller (MGC). The document is organised into the following
    major sections: * Introduction to R2 signalling * Definition of R2 package with
    brief description of the Events and signals in the package. * Different call flow
    scenarios where R2 signalling is used on either one end or both ends. Scenarios
    with multiple MGCs are also considered.</p>"
