abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft represent the initial public discussion of the value of
    proactive, reputation intelligence on the Internet and some of the challenges
    associated with these services that may be partially addressed through novel use
    of IPv6 features and functions. This document is intended to outline the concept
    of Internet reputation intelligence, the benefits it brings to network elements
    and endpoints. This draft also addresses the challenges associated with legacy
    security systems based on threat-signatures, and some of the current weaknesses
    of reputation management systems.</p>"
