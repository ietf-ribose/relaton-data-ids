abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Home network (Homenet) is a good application scenario for ICN\n
    \  considering it is a point where diverse users, devices, applications,\n   and
    services meet.  Homenets are getting increasingly complex with\n   the presence
    of application specific sensors, smart appliances, and\n   smart networking devices
    such as residential gateway.  Home\n   automation today is being driven by several
    alliances such as DLNA,\n   AllJoyn, ZigBee, and Z-Wave aimed at supporting homenet
    services such\n   as multimedia sharing, lighting control, climate control, and
    energy\n   management.  These standards overlay application semantics over a\n
    \  host centric architectures which is inefficient, and the lack of\n   inter-
    operability among these standards results in high cost,\n   inflexibility, and
    inter-operability issues.  Homenet is an\n   information-centric environment where
    the objective is to enable\n   consumers and producers to interact in a contextual
    manner\n   independent of their underlying topology arrangement.  Although the\n
    \  overall homenet objectives over an ICN framework versus any other are\n   the
    same; ICN can distinguish itself by providing a rich service\n   abstraction layer
    applicable in local scale as in BAN/PAN/LAN, and\n   also enable intelligent interaction
    beyond the homenet boundary.\n\n   In this draft we share the idea of a contextualized
    information-\n   centric bus (CIBUS) which builds over ICN abstraction of naming,
    name\n   resolution, and content dissemination for home network by providing\n
    \  support for service management, context processing and monitoring,\n   policy
    management, and policy based routing and forwarding.  CIBUS\n   allows applications
    and services to discover each other, subscribe/\n   notify to event upon which
    service composition can be realized\n   locally or in a centralize manner.  Furthermore,
    service policies can\n   be applied at high granularity which can be imposed in
    the routing\n   and forwarding plane through ICN extensions.  Some of these CIBUS\n
    \  features that were realized in [5] is presented here.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
