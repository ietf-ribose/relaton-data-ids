abstract:
  content: "<p>Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there
    is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a
    wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect
    of a network, for example the complexity of a graph or software. There is a desire
    to define the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide
    Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the
    topic of network complexity.</p>"
