abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   A limited form of statefulness
    is useful to improve PCE functionality\n   in situations in which the local TED
    might not be up to date, or in\n   the case of concurrent requests where most
    of the LSPs are computed\n   before the end of the set-up of the LSPs, when the
    TED is updated.\n   The PCC is responsible to setup or not the TE-Path computed
    by the\n   PCE.  By providing an indication that it intends to use the resources\n
    \  on the TE-Path a PCC can help the PCE to get a more accurate dynamic\n   TED
    view and thus the PCE can avoid suggesting the use of the same\n   resources for
    subsequent TE LSPs.\n\n   This document proposes an extension to the PCEP protocol
    to allow the\n   PCC to indicate to the PCE to block or reserve the resources
    computed\n   in a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for a certain\n
    \  time and can help to reduce the number of crankbacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
