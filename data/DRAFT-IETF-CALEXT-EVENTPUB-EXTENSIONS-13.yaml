    of new\n   iCalendar properties and components which are of particular use for\n
    \  event publishers and in social networking.\n\n   This specification also defines
    a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for\n   iCalendar RFC5545 to allow for data that
    is directly pertinent to an\n   event or task to be included with the calendar
    data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
