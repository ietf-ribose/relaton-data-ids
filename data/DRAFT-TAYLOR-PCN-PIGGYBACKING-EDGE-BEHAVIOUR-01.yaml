abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of\nservice for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\noverall
    PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo\ndescribes a behaviour for
    PCN egress nodes known as the\n\"piggybacking\" edge behaviour, because it \"piggybacks\"
    PCN\ninformation in resource signalling messages.  This version of the\nmemo describes
    two alternatives, where piggybacking is derived from\nthe CL edge behaviour and
    where it is derived from the SM edge\nbehaviour.  The SM and CL edge behaviours
    are specified in companion\ndocuments.\n\t </p>\n      "
