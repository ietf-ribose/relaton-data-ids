abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, the Request for Comments (RFC) moniker applies to all documents
    that are published by the RFC editor. This includes documents produced by IETF
    processes, such as IAB documents or working group standards, on an equal footing
    with individual contributions to the RFC editor. As a result, the term RFC does
    not mean that a document has been produced by the IETF (though some non-IETF RFCs
    strongly resemble IETF RFCs). This is at odds with the understanding of the commons,
    which has come to view RFCs as the output document series of the IETF. This document
    discusses the importance of aligning fact with this common understanding, and
    proposes that the name RFC be associated only with IETF documents.</p>"
