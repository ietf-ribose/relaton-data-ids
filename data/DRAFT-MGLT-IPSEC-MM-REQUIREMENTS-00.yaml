abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently IPsec mobility is the purpose of MOBIKE [RFC4555]
    which is\n   the IKEv2 multihoming and mobility extension.  More specifically,\n
    \  MOBIKE mobility support provides the ability to change the outer IP   address
    of a tunnel mode Security Association.  On the other hand\n   MOBIKE multihoming
    support provides the ability of a peer to inform\n   its correspondent that alternate
    IP addresses may be used if the\n   current IP address does not work any more.
    \ This draft presents\n   requirements to extend mobility and multihoming facilities.
    \ This\n   includes the use of simultaneous IP addresses as well as other IPsec\n
    \  mode like transport mode.\n\t </p>\n      "
