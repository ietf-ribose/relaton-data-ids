abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During RSVP-TE graceful restart (GR), the LSR communicates with\n
    its directly connected neighbors to synchronize LSP state to\n recover from control
    plane failure conditions. However, when the\n LSP has undergone a Fast Re-route
    (FRR), the directly connected\n neighbor of the Point of Local Repair (PLR) or
    Merge Point (MP)\n could be down. The FRR condition of the LSP could exist for
    a\n substantial period of time. During this period the network is\n vulnerable
    to traffic loss if control plane experiences a failure\n on the PLR or MP. This
    draft describes a mechanism to extend RSVP-\n TE GR to work under conditions where
    FRR has occurred.\n\t </p>\n      "
