abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Realizing the important role that photonic switches can play in
    \ndata-centric networks, work has been going on within the IETF to \ncombine the
    control plane of MPLS (more specifically traffic \nengineering) with the point-and-click
    provisioning capabilities of \nphotonic switches [1]. This document outlines a
    proposal to expand \nthis initiative to include DWDM, OADM and ATM systems. It
    also \nproposes to expand the work beyond simple establishment of optical \npaths
    and include optical performance monitoring and management. The \ncombined path
    routing and performance information that will be \ncarried and shared between
    these network elements will allow the \nelements or element management system
    (EMS) to adequately assess the \n'health' of an optical path (which can be a wavelength
    or fiber \nstrand). The routers and/or ATM switches at the edges of the \nphotonic
    network will then use this information to dynamically \nmanage the millions of
    wavelengths available in the photonic layer.\n\t </p>\n      "
