abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Opening a large mailbox in IMAP can take mailbox; 30 seconds
    is\n   realistic if the mailbox contains ten million messages. Most of that\n
    \  time is needed to number the messages consecutively.\n\n   This extension provides
    a way to avoid having to number the messages\n   consecutively.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
