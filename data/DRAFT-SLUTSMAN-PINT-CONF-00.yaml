abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  documents  contains the description of Conference Call Services\nfor
    PINT (CCSP)  and  defines    the  procedures  for  invoking  PSTN\nteleconferencing
    services  from an IP host.  In addition, CCSP allows\nfor the following options:
    \no automated negotiation of  conference  parameters,  such  as  date,\nagenda,
    and etc., before the PSTN resources are committed;  \no  monitoring the real-time
    conference status, such as keeping track\nof participants leaving/joining the
    conference bridge.  \n\nThe document also provides the list of basic APIs  to
    \ support  CCSP.\nMapping  these  APIs into appropriate PINT protocol(s) messages
    would\nbe addressed in the forthcoming documents.  This document is intended \nfor
    the  PSTN-Internet  Interworking  (PINT)  working  group  of  the\nInternet Engineering
    Task Force. Comments are solicited and SHOULD be \naddressed    to    the    working
    \   group's    mailing    list    at\npint@lists.research.bell-labs.com and/or
    the authos.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
