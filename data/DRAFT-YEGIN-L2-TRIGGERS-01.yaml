abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Wireless and mobile hosts are subject to changing their point
    of \nattachment from one access network to another. These changes result \nin
    link-layer events such as link up and link down. Information on \nthese events
    can be conveyed to interested parties in the form of \nlink-layer triggers. Primary
    consumers of this information are the \nmodules implementing mobility related
    network-layer protocols. When \nprovider and consumer of this information are
    co-located on the same \nIP node, required communication can take place via internal
    \nmechanisms. But when they are separate, as in the case of networks \nusing wired-to-wireless
    bridges, a transport mechanism is needed to \nconvey link-layer triggers. This
    draft defines a UDP based client-\nserver protocol for transporting link-layer
    triggers between two IP \nnodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
