abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As more constrained devices are integrating with current Internet,\n
    \  the ubiquitous computing in scenarios like smart home is very\n   important.
    In smart home, the constrained devices (ex. thermostat)\n   need to be provisioned
    in such a way that it can inter-operate with\n   any kind of devices like other
    constrained devices (ex. Air\n   conditioner) or client devices (ex. smart phone).
    This document\n   provides a method to support access privilege provisioning based
    on\n   pre-configured admission and resource control policies, where this\n   method
    explains device's service access in two different use cases:\n   first provisioning
    the service when a constrained device accessing\n   the service provided by other
    constrained device, second, accessing\n   the service provided by constrained
    device from the client device\n   (non constrained device).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
