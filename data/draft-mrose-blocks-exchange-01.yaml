abstract:
- content: "<p>Blocks[1] is an architecture for managing metadata. The architecture
    supports two models: the Blocks exchange model organizes information into navigation
    spaces, whilst the Blocks convergence model allows for bulk synchronization and
    knowledge management. This memo describes the Simple Exchange Profile (SEP) used
    to exchange objects, termed blocks, residing in an SEP datastore. To subscribe
    to the Blocks discussion list, send e-mail[5]; there is also a developers' site[6].</p>"
