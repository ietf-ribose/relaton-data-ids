abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through
    the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an A/AAAA record
    as a fallback. Unfortunately this means that the A/ AAAA record is taken to be
    mail server address even when that address does not accept mail. The NULL MX RR
    formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts
    no mail, which permits significant operational efficiencies.</p>"
