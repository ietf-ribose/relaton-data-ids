abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Adaptive Hybrid Domain Routing (AHDR)\n
    \  protocol. It describes the parts of the protocol that are required\n   of all
    implementations as well as optional requirements that each\n   implementation
    may include. AHDR allows router nodes to form far-\n   reaching ad-hoc networks,
    especially in wireless environments. AHDR\n   uses a combination of proactive
    and reactive routing schemes to be\n   responsive to topology changes without
    incurring high protocol\n   overhead. AHDR adapts to network conditions in order
    to minimize\n   network overhead and maximize network reachability.\n\t </p>\n
