abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document extends VRRP mechanism to support fast transition
    ofnon-master router to master when the original master router (is notfunctioning
    or) becomes unavailable. Through introducing anotherstate of router, named alternate
    state, when the failure of masterrouter is detected by alternate router with fast
    detectiontechnology, such as BFD, it will transmit to master immediately.Then
    the new master will inform other routers in its VRRP group toelect a new alternate
    router, and a fast detection session will beestablished between alternate and
    master routers, through which theavailability of the master can be detected by
    alternate router.</p>"
