abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A tremendous growth in different uses of the Internet has led
    to a\n   growing need to protect data sent over public networks, including\n   data
    sent via HTTP.  Resorting to the use of end-to-end TLS and https\n   for the majority
    of traffic looks at first like a most feasible\n   response.  However, the more
    sophisticated the web architecture\n   becomes as it goes beyond the simple client-server
    model, the more\n   the end-to-end use of TLS shows its downside as it excludes
    the use\n   of beneficial intermediaries like caches or proxies that provide\n
    \  instrumental services.  The need for greater privacy seems to collide\n   with
    the equally growing desire for better end-to-end performance and\n   user experience.
    \ As an example, the use of TLS and https often\n   appears to maximise the benefit
    for the first but not the benefit for\n   the combination of both.\n\n   This
    document describes this dilemma and lays out a number of\n   objectives of what
    should ideally be achieved, namely catering for\n   sufficient security and privacy
    whilst providing users with the\n   opportunity to make use of intermediaries'
    services where considered\n   beneficial.  We then introduce a number of characteristics
    potential\n   solutions could have, with the hope that those will steer us towards\n
    \  suitable protocol mechanisms and data formats.  End-to-end protocols\n   which
    are aware of intermediaries should enable users and/or content\n   providers to
    exercise fine-grained control over what intermediaries\n   shall be able to do
    and what exposure to data or metadata they shall\n   be permitted to get.  The
    document then highlights anticipated\n   benefits to key stakeholders like users,
    content providers and\n   intermediaries.  As elements like object security can
    play a useful\n   role, we encourage the analysis of related pieces of work in
    order to\n   discern their applicability, limitations, and coverage of use cases.\n
    \  This will allow us to frame an overall architecture and motivate more\n   detailed
    work on protocols and mechanisms in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
