abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo intends to define metrics that allow to aggregate
    metric\n   samples over a time interval.  Metrics that are identical in type and\n
    \  scope but collected at different times, or in different time windows,\n   can
    be aggregated into a new metric that characterizes the full time\n   interval.
    \ The document additionally introduces some comments on\n   terminology and motivation
    that could be the basis for a more general\n   framework for metric composition.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
