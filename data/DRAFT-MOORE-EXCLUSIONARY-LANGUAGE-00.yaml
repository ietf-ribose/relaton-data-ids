abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has been asserted that some language in IETF documents is\n
    \  \"exclusionary\" - that it offends some readers or groups of people,\n   and/or
    discourages participation in IETF by doing so.  While there is\n   some debate
    about exactly which language is exclusionary, at least\n   some cited examples
    of such language can credibly have such effects.\n   It is believed that most
    instances of such language are accidental,\n   and that most document authors
    and editors wish to avoid use of\n   language that may be offensive.  This memo
    therefore attempts to\n   establish procedures that warn document authors and
    editors about\n   language that may credibly having such effects, and thereby,
    to\n   reduce both accidental and deliberate use of such language.\n\n   At the
    same time, it is recognized that in some cases there an be\n   strong and conflicting
    opinions about whether or not particular\n   language is desirable or appropriate.
    \ IETF's primary function is\n   providing technical direction for the benefit
    of the Internet\n   community, rather than social engineering.  If a document
    can be\n   blocked or substantially delayed over disputes about the proprietary\n
    \  of language in that document, this can be disruptive to IETF's\n   primary
    function.  This memo therefore makes recommendations to\n   prevent such disputes
    from blocking progress on technical documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
