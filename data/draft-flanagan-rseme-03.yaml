abstract:
- content: "<p>The RFC Series has come to a crossroads where questions must be answered
    regarding how the Series should be managed, the role of the RFC Series Editor,
    and the oversight of the RFC Editor function. This draft offers a proposal to
    form a new IAB program called the RFC Editor Future Development Program. This
    proposal is based on the discussions held during three virtual meetings in September
    and October 2019, as well as the RSEME session at IETF 106, and requests a new,
    open IAB program that will drive consensus around any changes to the RFC Editor
    model. The program will require extensive community engagement and outreach to
    a broad set of stakeholder communities.</p>"
