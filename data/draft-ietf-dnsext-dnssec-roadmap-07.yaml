abstract:
  content: "\t <t>DNS Security (DNSSEC)technology is composed of extensions to theDomain
    Name System (DNS) protocol that provide data integrity andauthentication to security
    aware resolvers and applications throughthe use of cryptographic digital signatures.
    Several documents existto describe these extensions and the implementation-specific
    detailsregarding specific digital signing schemes. The interrelationshipbetween
    these different documents is discussed here. A briefoverview of what to find in
    which document and author guidelines forwhat to include in new DNS Security documents,
    or revisions toexisting documents, is described.</p>"
