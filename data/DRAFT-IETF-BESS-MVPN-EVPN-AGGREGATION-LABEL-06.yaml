abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MVPN specifications allow a single Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP)\n   tunnel to carry traffic of multiple VPNs.  The EVPN specifications\n
    \  allow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast\n   Domains
    (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP\n   tunnel to allocate
    an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or\n   for each BD.  A packet sent
    on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label\n   that is mapped to its VPN or BD.  (In
    some cases, a distinct\n   upstream-assigned is needed for each flow.)  Since
    each ingress\n   router allocates labels independently, with no coordination among
    the\n   ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large\n
    \  number of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large (or\n   larger)
    than the product of the number of ingress routers times the\n   number of VPNs
    or BDs.  However, the number of labels can be greatly\n   reduced if the association
    between a label and a VPN or BD is made by\n   provisioning, so that all ingress
    routers assign the same label to a\n   particular VPN or BD.  New procedures are
    needed in order to take\n   advantage of such provisioned labels.  These new procedures
    also\n   apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels.  This document\n   updates
    RFCs 6514, 7432 and 7582 by specifying the necessary\n   procedures.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
