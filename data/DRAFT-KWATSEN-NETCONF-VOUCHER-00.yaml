abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the two artifacts \"voucher\" and \"voucher-\n
    \  revocation\", which are YANG-defined structures that have been signed\n   by
    a TBD algorithm.\n\n   The voucher artifact is generated by the device's manufacture
    or\n   delegate.  The voucher's purpose is to securely assign one or more\n   devices
    to an owner.  The voucher informs each device which entity it\n   should consider
    to be its owner.\n\n   The voucher revocation artifact is used by the manufacturer
    or\n   delegate (i.e.  the issuer of the voucher) to revoke vouchers, if\n   ever
    necessary.  The voucher revocation format defined herein\n   supports both issuer-wide
    and voucher-specific constructs, enabling\n   usage flexibility.\n\n   For both
    artifacts, this memo only defines the artifact, leaving it\n   to future work
    to describe specialized protocols for accessing them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
