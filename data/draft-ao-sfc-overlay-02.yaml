abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain (SFC) network presents a distinct network layer.
    As such, it is carried over by an underlay network. The document reviews two interworking
    scenarios between the SFC domain and its underlay network - co-located and stand-alone.
    The document also defines necessary interworking between stand-alone Network Virtual
    Edge and Service Forwarding Function entities to ensure proper handling of SFC
    traffic by the underlay network.</p>"
