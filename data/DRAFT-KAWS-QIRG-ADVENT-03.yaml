abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of link-state routing protocols
    on\n   classical links in Quantum Networks.  It contains proposals for\n   additions
    to the IS-IS and OSPF protocols in order for them to\n   transport relevant information
    for a Quantum Network, specifically,\n   for the creation and manipulation of
    entangled pairs.  The document\n   will describe some of the necessary attributes
    and some suggestions\n   of how this information may be used.\n\n   No Schrodinger's
    cats were harmed in the creation of this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
