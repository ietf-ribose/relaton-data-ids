abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In EVPN, the Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM)
    traffic\n   is sent to all the routers participating in the EVPN instance.  In
    a\n   multi-homing scenario, when more than one PEs share the same Ethernet\n
    \  Segment, i.e. there are more than one PEs in a redundancy group, only\n   the
    PE that is the Designated-Forwarder (DF) for the ES will forward\n   that packet
    on the access interface whereas all non-DF PEs will drop\n   the packet.  In deployments
    such as EVPN Gateways (EVPN GW) or Data\n   Center Interconnect (DCI) routers,
    this can be quite wasteful.  This\n   is especially true if there are significantly
    more EVPN GW or DCI PEs\n   all participating in the same sets of ES and vES.
    \ This draft\n   explores the problem and provides solutions for the same.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
