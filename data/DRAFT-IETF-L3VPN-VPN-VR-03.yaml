abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a network-based Virtual Private Network
    \n   (VPN) architecture using the virtual router (VR) concept. Multiple \n   VRs
    can exist in a single physical device. A VR emulates all the \n   functionality
    of a physical router, and therefore inherits all \n   existing mechanisms and
    tools for configuration, operation, \n   accounting, and maintenance. Any routing
    protocol can be used to \n   distribute VPN reachability information among VRs,
    and no VPN-\n   related modifications or extensions are needed to the routing
    \n   protocol for achieving VPN reachability. Direct VR-to-VR \n   connectivity
    may be configured through layer-2 links or through IP- \n   or MPLS-based tunnels.
    Traffic from VRs belonging to different VPNs \n   may be aggregated over a \"backbone
    VR\" network, which greatly \n   simplifies VPN provisioning. This architecture
    accommodates various \n   backbone deployment scenarios, both where the VPN service
    provider \n   owns the backbone, and where the VPN service provider obtains \n
    \  backbone service from one or more other service providers.\n\t </p>\n      "
