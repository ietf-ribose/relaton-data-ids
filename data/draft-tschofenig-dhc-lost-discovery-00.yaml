abstract:
  content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes an XML-based
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial orcivic location information
    to service contact Uniform ResourceLocators (URIs). LoST servers can be located
    anywhere but aplacement closer to the end host, i.e., in the access network, isdesireable.
    Such a LoST server placement provides benefits indisaster situations with intermittent
    network connectivity regardingthe resiliency of emergency service communication.This
    document describes such a LoST discovery procedure based onDHCP.</p>"
