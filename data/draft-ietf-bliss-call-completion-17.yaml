abstract:
- content: <p>The call completion feature defined in this specification allows the
    caller of a failed call to be notified when the callee becomes available to receive
    a call. For the realization of a basic solution without queuing, this document
    references the usage of the dialog event package (RFC 4235) that is described
    as 'automatic redial' in the SIP Service Examples (RFC 5359). For the realization
    of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document introduces an architecture
    for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol where "call
    completion" implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints
    cooperate to place the caller's request for call completion into a queue at the
    callee's endpoint, and when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt
    of the original, failed call is made. The architecture is designed to interoperate
    well with existing call- completion solutions in other networks.</p>
