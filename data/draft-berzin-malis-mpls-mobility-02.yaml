abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a new approach to handling user mobility atthe
    network layer in the context of Multi-Protocol Label SwitchedNetworks (MPLS).
    This approach does not rely on the existing IPmobility management protocols such
    as Mobile IP, and is instead basedon the combination of Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP)
    and MPLS. Thisdocument proposes to introduce new protocol elements to MP-BGP toachieve
    Mobility Label distribution at the network control plane andthe optimal packet
    delivery to the mobile node by the networkforwarding plane using MPLS.</p>"
