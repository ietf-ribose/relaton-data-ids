abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs [RFC7519], are URL-safe
    JSON-\n   based security tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed\n
    \  and/or encrypted.  JWTs are being widely used and deployed as a\n   simple
    security token format in numerous protocols and applications,\n   both in the
    area of digital identity, and in other application areas.\n   The goal of this
    Best Current Practices document is to provide\n   actionable guidance leading
    to secure implementation and deployment\n   of JWTs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
