abstract:
  content: <p>Currently BGP-4 is capable of carrying multiple (Outbound RouteFilters)
    ORFs entries for a given "AFI/SAFI". Each ORF provides afilter that a route whose
    NLRI matches AFI/SAFI, must pass through tobe transmitted in the BGP Update message.
    Efficient processing ofORF filters may require ordering of individual ORFs in
    certainsequence and grouping of ORFs that should be applied together. Thegrouping
    functionality also provides the support for logical ORoperation between the grouped
    ORFs.This group ORF provides an ORF type that specifies that ordering andgrouping.
    The route set that passes set of ORFs running in a "GroupORF" will pass the same
    ORFs sent in normal ORFs.</p>
