abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol used in the internet
    to exchange routing information between network domains. This protocol does not
    directly include mechanisms that control that routes exchanged conform to the
    various rules defined by the Internet community. This document intends to summarize
    most common existing rules and help network administrators applying simply coherent
    BGP policies. First it recalls mechanisms that administrators can use to protect
    the BGP sessions, with TTL and MD5. Then the document describes the prefix filters
    that can be used, how some of them can be automated, and where they apply in the
    BGP network. Afterwards, applicability of other methods including BGP route flap
    dampening, limiting maximum prefixes per peering, AS-path filtering and community
    scrubbing is analyzed.</p>"
