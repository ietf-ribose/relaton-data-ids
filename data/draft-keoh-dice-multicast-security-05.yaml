abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP and 6LoWPAN standards are fast emerging as key protocols in
    the area of resource-constrained devices. Such IP-based systems are foreseen to
    be used for building and lighting control systems where wireless devices interconnect
    with each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). Both multicast and
    its security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a method for
    securing IPv6 multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS which is already
    supported for unicast communication for CoAP devices. This draft deals with the
    adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group communication,
    assuming that all group members already have the group security association parameters
    in their possession. The adapted DTLS record layer provides message confidentiality,
    integrity and replay protection to group messages using the group keying material
    before sending the message via IPv6 multicast to the group.</p>"
