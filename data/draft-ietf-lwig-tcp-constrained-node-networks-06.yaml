abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs), which are a characterstic
    of the Internet of Things (IoT). Such environments require a lightweight TCP implementation
    and may not make use of optional functionality. This document explains a number
    of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as well as corresponding
    tradeoffs. The objective is to help embedded developers with decisions on which
    TCP features to use.</p>"
