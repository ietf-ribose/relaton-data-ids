abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework for an RFC Series and
    an RFC\n   Editor function that incorporate the principles of organized\n   community
    involvement and accountability that has become necessary as\n   the Internet technical
    community has grown, thereby enabling the RFC\n   Series to continue to fulfill
    its mandate.\n\n   Cover Note:\n\n   {{ RFC Editor: Please remove this cover note
    prior to publication. }}\n\n   The IASA2 WG asks the IAB to publish this replacement
    for RFC 4844.\n   The document is changed for alignment with the new structure
    for the\n   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA), eliminating all\n   references
    to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
