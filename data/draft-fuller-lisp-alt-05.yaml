abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method of building an alternative, logical
    topology for managing Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locator mappings using the
    Locator/ID Separation Protocol. The logical network is built as an overlay on
    the public Internet using existing technologies and tools, specifically the Border
    Gateway Protocol and the Generic Routing Encapsulation. An important design goal
    for LISP+ALT is to allow for the relatively easy deployment of an efficient mapping
    system while minimizing changes to existing hardware and software.</p>"
