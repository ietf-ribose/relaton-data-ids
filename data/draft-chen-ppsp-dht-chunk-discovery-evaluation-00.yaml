- content: "<p>Recently, some researchers have suggested that DHT should be applied
    to the P2P streaming system to do the media block search. This draft evaluates
    this proposal by simulation and modeling analysis, and discloses that it is inappropriate
    for P2P live streaming system. Chen Expires April 18, 2010 [page 2] Internet-Draft
