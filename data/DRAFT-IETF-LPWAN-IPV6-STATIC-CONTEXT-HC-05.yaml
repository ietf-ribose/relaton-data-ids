abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation\n
    \  functionality for very low bandwidth networks.  These techniques are\n   especially
    tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks.\n\n   The Static Context
    Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of\n   flexibility when processing
    the header fields and must be used for\n   these kind of networks.  A common context
    stored in a LPWAN device\n   and in the network is used.  This context keeps information
    that will\n   not be transmitted in the constrained network.  Static context means\n
    \  that information stored in the context which describes field values,\n   does
    not change during packet transmission, avoiding complex\n   resynchronization
    mechanisms, incompatible with LPWAN\n   characteristics.  In most of the cases,
    IPv6/UDP headers are reduced\n   to a small identifier called Rule ID.  But sometimes
    the SCHC header\n   compression mechanisms will not be enough to send the compressed\n
    \  packet in one L2 PDU, so the SCHC Fragmentation protocol must be used\n   when
    needed.\n\n   This document describes SCHC compression/decompression mechanism\n
    \  framework and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers.  Similar solutions for\n   other
    protocols such as CoAP will be described in separate documents.\n   Moreover,
    this document specifies fragmentation and reassembly\n   mechanim for SCHC compressed
    packets exceeding the L2 PDU size and\n   for the case where the SCHC compression
    is not possible then the\n   packet is sent using the fragmentation protocol.\n\n\t
