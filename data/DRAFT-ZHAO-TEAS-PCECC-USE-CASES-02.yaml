abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would\n   like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and\n
    \  GMPLS network while reducing existing complexity.In this document,\n   we propose
    to use the PCE as a central controller so that LSP can be\n   calculated/signaled/initiated/downloaded/managed
    through a\n   centralized PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path\n
    \  while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.\n\n   This
    draft describes the use cases for using the PCE as the central\n   controller
    where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded/\n   maintained through extending
    the current PCE architectures and\n   extending the PCEP.\n\n\n   \n\t </p>\n
