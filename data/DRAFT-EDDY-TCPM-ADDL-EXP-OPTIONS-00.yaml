abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There have been multiple issues with the allocation of TCP
    option\n   kind numbers recently.  Two of these issues, which this document\n
    \  attempts to address, are that there were only a small number of\n   options
    reserved by RFC 4727 for experiment and test use in the RFC\n   3692 style to
    begin with, and both of these have been used in\n   shipping products.  This impacts
    the ability of other research and\n   experimental efforts to develop and test
    running code since\n   registration of other option numbers requires either IESG
    Approval or\n   Standards Action.  This document proposes designation of additional\n
    \  experimental options in the IANA registry for TCP Option Kind\n   Numbers,
    intended to resolve the possible barriers to using the\n   existing RFC 3962 experimental-use
    options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
