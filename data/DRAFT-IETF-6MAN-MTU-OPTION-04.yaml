abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is
    used to\n   record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source\n
    \  host to a destination host.  This collects a minimum Path MTU\n   recorded
    along the path to the destination.  The value can then be\n   communicated back
    to the source using the return Path MTU field in\n   the option.\n\n   This Hop-by-Hop
    option is intended to be used in environments like\n   Data Centers and on paths
    between Data Centers, to allow them to\n   better take advantage of paths able
    to support a large Path MTU.  The\n   method could also be useful in other environments,
    including the\n   general Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
