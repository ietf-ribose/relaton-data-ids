abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes the use of IPSec [KeAt98a-c] for secure access
    toprotected networks by authorized users connected to the Internet. Anexample
    target scenario is a corporate employee on the road accessingresources on his
    company's Intranet. It addresses firewall traversal,user authentication, data
    confidentiality and the use of privateaddress spaces (the latter impacts routing
    and name lookups). Acomparison to other mechanisms such as those based on Layer-2tunneling
    or session layer security, is also included. This memo draws upon several ideas
    from [Dora97,Mosk98] and would not have been possible without the contributions
    of the IETF working groups on IP Security (IPSec) and Network Address Translation
    (NAT).</p>"
