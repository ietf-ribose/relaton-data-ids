abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes operational guidelines for devices and software
    which implement fax-over-SMTP [SERVICE]. An device which implements [SERVICE]
    and this document will be able to exchange capabilities, confirm message receipt,
    perform immediate delivery, and determine the length of a call. Additionally,
    some guidelines are introduced to allow for new functions to be added without
    breaking older implementations.</p>"
