abstract:
- content: "<p>A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is the public-key version of a keyed
    cryptographic hash. Only the holder of the private key can compute the hash, but
    anyone with the public key can verify the correctness of the hash. VRFs are useful
    for preventing enumeration of hash-based data structures. This document specifies
    several VRF constructions based on RSA and Elliptic Curves that are secure in
    the cryptographic random oracle model.</p>"
