abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   By introducing new Information Elements (IEs), this draft extends
    the\n   existing BGP-related IEs to enable IPFIX [RFC7011] to export BGP\n   community
    information, including BGP standard communities [RFC1997],\n   BGP extended communities
    [RFC4360], and BGP large communities\n   [RFC8092].  Network traffic information
    can then be accumulated and\n   analyzed at the BGP community granularity, which
    represents the\n   traffic of different kinds of customers, services, or geographical\n
    \  regions according to the network operator's BGP community planning.\n   Network
    traffic information at the BGP community granularity is\n   useful for network
    traffic analysis and engineering.\n\n   To clarify, no new BGP community attribute
    is defined in this\n   document and this document does not replace BGP Monitoring
    Protocol\n   (BMP) defined in RFC7854.  The IEs introduced in this document are\n
    \  used by IPFIX, together with other IEs, to facilitate the IPFIX\n   Collector
    analyzing network traffic at the BGP community granularity\n   without needing
    to run the heavy BGP itself.  When needed, the IPFIX\n   Mediator or Collector
    can use the IEs introduced in this document to\n   report the BGP community-related
    traffic flow information it gets\n   either from Exporters or through local correlation
    to other IPFIX\n   devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
