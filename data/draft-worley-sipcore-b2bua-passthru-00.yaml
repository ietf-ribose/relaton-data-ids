abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Some SIP architectures use \"application servers\", B2BUAs that
    areinserted between two user agents during a conversation, to provideadditional
    processing. Since B2BUAs do not follow the rules for SIPproxies, they do not by
    default interoperate with SIP call controloperations. Augmenting application servers
    with suitable behaviorsfor handling SIP call control operations mitigates these
    problems,and in many cases, allows standard user agents to use SIP callcontrol
    features without modification.</p>"
