abstract:
- content: "<p>In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
    between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go beyond the definition
    of a Proxy, performing functions not defined in standards-track RFCs. The only
    term for such devices provided in [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA),
    which is defined as the logical concatenation of a User Agent Server (UAS) and
    User Agent Client (UAC). There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents
    (B2BUAs), performing different roles in different ways. For Example IP-PBXs, SBCs
    and Application Servers. This document identifies several common B2BUA roles,
    in order to provide taxonomy other documents can use and reference.</p>"
