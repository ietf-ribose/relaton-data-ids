abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs using provider-\n
    \  assigned addresses is difficult without the use of some form of\n   Network
    Address Translation (NAT).  Much has been written on this\n   topic over the last
    10 to 15 years, but it still remains a problem\n   without a clearly defined or
    widely implemented solution.  Any\n   multihoming solution without NAT requires
    hosts at the site to have\n   addresses from each ISP and to select the egress
    ISP by selecting a\n   source address for outgoing packets.  It also requires
    routers at the\n   site to take into account those source addresses when forwarding\n
    \  packets out towards the ISPs.\n\n   This document attempts to define a complete
    solution to this problem.\n   It covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic
    taking into\n   account source address, and it covers the behavior of host to
    select\n   appropriate source addresses.  It also covers any possible role that\n
    \  routers might play in providing information to hosts to help them\n   select
    appropriate source addresses.  In the process of exploring\n   potential solutions,
    this documents also makes explicit requirements\n   for how the solution would
    be expected to behave from the perspective\n   of an enterprise site network administrator
    .\n\n\t </p>\n      "
