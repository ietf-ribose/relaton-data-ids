abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important
    for\n   network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public\n   policy.
    \ To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data,\n   either on their
    own initiative or instructed by a measurement\n   controller, and then upload
    the measurement results to a designated\n   measurement server.  Understanding
    the various scenarios and users of\n   measuring broadband performance is essential
    to development of the\n   system requirements.  The details of the measurement
    metrics\n   themselves are beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
