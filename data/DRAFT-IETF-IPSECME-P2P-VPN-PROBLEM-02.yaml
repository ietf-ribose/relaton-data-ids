abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problem of enabling a large number
    of\n   systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic\n   between
    them.  It them expands on the requirements, for such a\n   solution.\n\n   Manual
    configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in\n   many such cases.
    \ In other cases the IP address of end points change\n   or the end points may
    be behind NAT gateways, making static\n   configuration impossible.  The Auto
    Discovery VPN solution is\n   chartered to address these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n
