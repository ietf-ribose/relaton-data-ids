abstract:
- content: "<p>[IPV6] specifies routing header processing for nodes. The text is sufficiently
    ambiguous where the behaviour of hosts is concerned. This draft clarifies the
    issue by referring to IPv4 Host Requirements document and requiring hosts must
    not, by default, forward routing headers outside of the node.</p>"
