abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a method for the distribution of source\n
    \  address selection policy from ISPs to gateway routers for consumers\n   and
    from the gateways to end nodes.  This method is particularly\n   effective when
    a consumer site has multiple address blocks.  Every\n   end node is guided by
    the policy in selecting an appropriate source\n   address for each destination
    address and every gateway is guided by\n   the policy in forwarding packets to
    appropriate next-hop ISPs.  This\n   makes it possible for an end node to set
    a connection up without\n   being concerned about failures of transfer due to
    ingress filtering\n   by the ISPs, for ISP operators to manage consumers' behavior
    and\n   networking policy, and for consumers to be provided with networks\n   that
    are almost automatically robust and reliable.\n\t </p>\n      "
