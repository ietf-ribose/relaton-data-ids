abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is the Workshop Report for the IETF Administrative Support\n
    \  Activity 2.0 (IASA 2.0) Virtual Workshops, held on 28 February 2017\n   at
    1100 UT and 1600 UT.  The original IETF Administrative Support\n   Activity (IASA)
    was created ten years ago, and since has been subject\n   to some reflection.
    \ In the intervening years, there has been\n   considerable change in the necessary
    tasks of IETF administration and\n   in the world around the IETF, and in how
    the IETF raises funds and\n   finances its work.  The IASA 2.0 process seeks to
    address which\n   administrative arrangements will best support the IETF going
    forward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
