abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 over low-power personal
    areanetwork (IEEE 802.15.4). IEEE 802.15.4 and other low-power wirelessnetworks
    have limited or no usage of broadcast or multicast signalingdue to energy conservation.
    Besides the wireless nodes may notstrictly follow traditional concept of IP subnet
    and IP-links whileconnecting nodes and routers. This document describes simpleoptimizations
    to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol(RFC4861), andaddressing mechanisms that are
    useful for small scale 6LoWPANnetworks in star and mesh topologies.The optimizations
    include reducing the amount of Neighbor Discoverymulticast traffic and allowing
    for a single subnet to span multiplerouters in a \"route-over\" topology.</p>"
