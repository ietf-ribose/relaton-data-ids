abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS-SD allows a client to find a list of named instances of
    a service\n   name over a particular transport within a domain of interest using\n
    \  standard DNS queries.  As the number of potential responders\n   increases,
    DNS-SD based discovery doesn't scale well.  To mitigate\n   the scaling issues,
    schemes to narrow down the search context would\n   be needed.  The document proposes
    to include key/value pairs in the\n   form of a DNS TXT record along with the
    service name in the DNS query\n   to assist with the discovery process.  The DNS
    TXT record can be\n   placed in the additional section of the query without requiring
    any\n   changes to the structure of DNS messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
