abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks
    by\nusing the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,\nAuthorization
    and Accounting (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent\nwork done in the Roaming
    Operations (ROAMOPS) Working Group was to\ninvestigate whether RADIUS could be
    used in a roaming network, and\nconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain
    purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
