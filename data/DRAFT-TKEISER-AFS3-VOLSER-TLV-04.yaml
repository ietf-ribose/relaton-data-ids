abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed
    at\n   Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s.  AFS-3 heavily leverages\n
    \  Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed\n   architecture.
    \ This memo extends the volume management interface to\n   support getting and
    setting of AFS volume attributes via an\n   extensible Tag-Length-Value (TLV)
    encoding, which is based upon AFS-3\n   extensible discriminated unions.  TLV-based
    get and set RPCs are\n   specified, along with a tag enumeration RPC.\n\n   In
    addition, tags are allocated for existing volume and transaction\n   metadata,
    and implementation-private tags are allocated for metadata\n   related to the
    OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server, and the RxOSD\n   protocol suite.\n\nInternet
    Draft Comments\n\n   Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include
    the\n   AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org)
    as a recipient of any comments.\n\nAFS-3 Document State\n\n   This document is
    in state \"draft\", as per the document state\n   definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].\n\n\t
