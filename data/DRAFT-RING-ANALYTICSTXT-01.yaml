abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet privacy has become an important feature for users
    of\n   websites and services.  This document proposes a way for websites and\n
    \  services to declare and disclose their usage of analytics and\n   tracking
    software. analytics.txt aims to be an elaborate file format\n   that describes
    the privacy related characteristics of analytics and\n   tracking software in
    a non-biased way.  An analytics.txt file is\n   understandable for a non-technical
    audience, while also useful for\n   the automated consumption by tools and software.\n\n\t
