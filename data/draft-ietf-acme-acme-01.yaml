abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificates in the Web's X.509 PKI (PKIX) are used for a number of
    purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.
    Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant
    for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.
    Today, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms. This
    document describes a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant
    can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance. The
    protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions,
    such as certificate revocation. DANGER: Do not implement this specification. It
    has a known signature reuse vulnerability. For details, see the following discussion:
