abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is intended to fix a large
    number of\n   problems with IPv4 that have been identified through many years
    of\n   global use, not least of which is the shortage of available IPv4\n   addresses.
    \ One of the challenges with IPv4 that has not, apparently,\n   been adequately
    considered is the crime attribution characteristics\n   of IPv6 technologies.\n\n
    \  The challenge of crime attribution on the Internet is an important\n   one
    and a careful balance needs to be struck between the needs of law\n   enforcement,
    the rights of crime victims and the right to privacy of\n   the vast majority
    of Internet users who have no involvement in any\n   sort of criminality.\n\n
    \  The purpose of this document is to consider the crime attribution\n   characteristics
    of various IPv6 address assignment techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
