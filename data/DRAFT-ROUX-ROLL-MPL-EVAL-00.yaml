abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft presents simulation work and first results related
    to MPL\n   performance evaluation.  The simulation makes it possible to evaluate\n
    \  MPL performances in the context of a large network.  The simulated\n   network
    introduces 500 nodes.  The general principles of the\n   simulator are described.
    \ Then reference settings are introduced, and\n   evaluation indicators are proposed.
    \ Finally preliminary results are\n   presented under the form of a few tables,
    that show the proposed\n   indicator values depending on some specific parameter
    which is used\n   as a variable argument.  Among various results, the advantage
    of\n   using reactive mode for MPL is shown in terms of the capability to\n   maintain
    loss free diffusion in harsh radio conditions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
