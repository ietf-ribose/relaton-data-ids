abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration and Maintenance is an integral part of transport
    connections, hence it is required that Operations, Administration and Maintenance
    functions are activated/deactivated in sync with connection commissioning/decommissioning;
    avoiding spurious alarms and ensuring consistent operation. In certain technologies,
    Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities are inherently established
    once the connection is set up, while other technologies require extra configuration
    to establish and configure Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities.
    This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and
    configuration of Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities along with
    Label Switched Path signaling.</p>"
