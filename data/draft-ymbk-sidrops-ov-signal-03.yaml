abstract:
- content: "<p>Within a trust boundary, e.g. an operator's PoP, it may be useful to
    have only a few central devices do full Origin Validation using the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure, and be able to signal to an internal sender that a received
    route fails Origin Validation. E.g. route reflectors could perform Origin Validation
    for a cluster and signal back to a sending client that it sent an invalid route.
    Routers capable of sending and receiving this signal can use the extended community
    described in [RFC8097].</p>"
