abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides an analysis and comparison of IPv4 and IPv6header
    sizes under various circumstances. The goal of this documentis to provide hard
    evidence for use in frequent discussions regardingtransition, where header overhead
    comes up as an issue used toportray IPv6 depolyment as untenable. The results
    show that forlinks that are not fully utilized, the IPv6 overhead would only add
    afew percent to their load over what IPv4 implies, while for congestedlinks, we
    note that header compression techniques for IPv6 are atleast as effective as those
    for IPv4. This demonstrates that theheader overhead argument against IPv6 is misinformed.</p>"
