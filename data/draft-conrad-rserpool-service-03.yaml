abstract:
- content: "<p>RSerPool [1] is a framework to provide highly available services between
    clients and servers. This is achieved by grouping servers into pools, each with
    an identifier and pooling policy. Three classes of entities are defined: Pool
    Users (clients), Pool Elements (servers), and Name Servers. This memo defines
    the services provided by this framework to upper layer protocols and applications
    for Pool Users and Pool Elements. It describes the service primitives that the
    framework provides and describes example scenarios.</p>"
