abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information \n
    \   Export (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing \n    per-packet
    information.  \n    The main idea is to export two types of records per flow:
    the \n    first one contains the usual flow information plus a unique flow \n
    \   identifier while the other one consists of the actual per-packet \n    information
    plus a flow identifier that refers to the flow the \n    specific packet belongs
    to -- that means the flow identifier is \n    used to associate the packet data
    to its corresponding flow.\n\t </p>\n      "
