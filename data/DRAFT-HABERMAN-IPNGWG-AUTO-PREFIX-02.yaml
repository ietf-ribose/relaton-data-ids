abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The expansion of the IP address space provided by IPv6 makes it
    both \npossible and reasonable to allocate entire subnets to environments \nthat
    had been previously limited to a few individual IP addresses. \nOther protocols
    such as Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address \nAutoconfiguration allow hosts
    within those subnets to be \nautomatically configured. The router between this
    subnet and the \nupstream world requires just one more piece to make this process
    \nautomatic, a network prefix. \nThis document describes a mechanism for the automated
    delegation of \nan IPv6 network prefix. It allows routers to request either a
    \nspecific prefix or any prefix. Upon authorizing the request the \ndelegating
    router then returns a prefix and a lifetime for the use \nof the prefix.  Optionally,
    the delegating and requesting routers \ncan exchange routing protocol information.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
