abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIP Identity header conveys cryptographic identity information\n
    \  about the originators of SIP requests.  The Secure Telephone Identity\n   Revisited
    (STIR) framework however provides no means for determining\n   the identity of
    the called party in a traditional telephone calling\n   scenario.  This document
    updates prior guidance on the \"connected\n   identity\" problem to reflect the
    changes to SIP Identity that\n   accompanied STIR, and considers a revised problem
    space for connected\n   identity as a means of detecting calls that have been
    retargeted to a\n   party impersonating the intended destination, as well as spoofing
    of\n   mid-dialog or dialog-terminating events by intermediaries or third\n   parties.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
