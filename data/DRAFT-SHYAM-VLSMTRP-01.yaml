abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a light weight routing protocol applicable inside a
    network\n   that appears in the form of a tree and distribution of address space\n
    \  takes place with the approach of VLSM. It is based on setting default\n   route
    inside VLSM tree.  With this approach, routing information of\n   the external
    world need not be passed down to the VLSM tree. Thus,\n   load inside a router
    gets reduced substantially.  This document\n   includes IP-VPN with MPLS inside
    VLSM tree by extending RSVP-TE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
