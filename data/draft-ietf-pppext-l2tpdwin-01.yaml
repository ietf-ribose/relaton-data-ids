abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines the specification of
    congestion window sizes for data sessions. In addition, an LNS is given the capability
    to turn off sequence number processing for a data session, provided the LAC did
    not include the Sequencing Required AVP during session setup. This document specifies
    a mechanism whereby an L2TP peer can dynamically change the maximum window size
    values being used for a data session, in order to provide the flexibility to operate
    with smaller window sizes when history-bound protocols are operating over a session,
    and larger window sizes when no history-bound protocols are operating over a session.</p>"
