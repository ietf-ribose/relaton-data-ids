abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic\n
    \  Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified\n   unicast
    or multicast data flows for real-time applications with\n   extremely low data
    loss rates and bounded latency within a network\n   domain.  Techniques used include:
    1) reserving data plane resources\n   for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows
    in some or all of the\n   intermediate nodes along the path of the flow; 2) providing
    explicit\n   routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the\n
    \  network topology; and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets\n   over
    time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in\n   spite of the
    loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and\n   delivers service over
    sub-network technologies such as MPLS and IEEE\n   802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking
    (TSN).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
