abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and a Router Advertisement
    (RA) option to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal
    enforcement device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access.
    It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with
    captive portals; it is designed to be one component of a standardized approach
    for hosts to interact with such portals. While this document defines how the network
    operator may convey the captive portal API endpoint to hosts, the specific methods
    of authenticating to, and interacting with the captive portal are out of scope
    of this document. This document replaces RFC 7710. RFC 7710 used DHCP code point
    160. Due to a conflict, this document specifies 114. [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis. The most
    recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.
    The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. Text in square brackets will be
    removed before publication. ]</p>"
