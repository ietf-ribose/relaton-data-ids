abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of Mirror Proxy that enables sleeping
    devices to participate in a REST architecture despite the fact that they are not
    web servers. Most constrained devices may sleep during long periods preventing
    them from acting as traditional web servers. However as client-only endpoints
    they can rely on a Mirror Proxy to cache and serve the content they provide.</p>"
