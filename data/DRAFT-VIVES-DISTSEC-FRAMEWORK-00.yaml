abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the years, it has been noticed that network firewalls
    are an\n   inadequeate mechanism in most cases for protecting the hosts,\n   especially
    from internal attacks.  This document analyzes two\n   security paradigms, the
    network-based and the host-based\n   (distributed), and in consequence outlines
    a problem statement and\n   framework for distributed security.\n\t </p>\n      "
