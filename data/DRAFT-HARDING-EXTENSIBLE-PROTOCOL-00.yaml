abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Extensible Protocol (XP).  XP is a generic\n
    \  application-level protocol meant to serve as the foundation for\n   specific
    protocols, in a manner analogous to the way in which the\n   Extensible Markup
    Language (XML) recommendation of the World Wide Web\n   Consortium serves as the
    foundation for specific markup languages. XP\n   is a bidirectional protocol on
    which XML documents are exchanged\n   between two endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
