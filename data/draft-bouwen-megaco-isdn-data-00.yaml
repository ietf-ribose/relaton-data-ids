abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In ISDN interfaces the D-channel is used to transport the Q.931signalling
    messages. In addition, the D-channel can transport packetdata for user-to-user
    communication. The Megaco protocolspecification has to be extended to support
    data in an ISDN D-channel. More specifically, ephemeral terminations on top ofphysical
    ISDN terminations have to be allowed, and support for theISDN addressing scheme
    has to be added to refer to the data streamsin the D-channel. This draft defines
    the required additionalfunctionality, that could be part of the second version
    of theMegaco protocol.</p>"
