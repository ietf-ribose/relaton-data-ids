abstract:
- content: '<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting paths through a traffic engineering network. These paths may be supplied
    in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited requests issued
    by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may be categorized
    and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC XXXX defines the Flow Specification
    and describes how Flow Specification Components are used to describe traffic flows.
    RFC XXXX also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow
    specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document specifies a
    set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This
    allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is
    aware of. The extensions defined in this document include the creation, update,
    and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP, and can be applied to tunnels
    initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to the PCE by the
    PCC. Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications
    in the request to indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor
    this into the path computation. RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX in the Abstract
    with the RFC number assigned to draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis when it is published.
    Please remove this note.</p>'
