abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing specification for Multipoint Label Distribution
    Protocol\n   (mLDP) functionality assumes that a pair of LDP speakers which\n
    \  support the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected, or they can\n   reach
    each other through targeted LDP session and transparent\n   tunnel(s).  However,
    the real deployment may not satisfy these\n   assumptions, especially in the case
    where the targeted LDP session\n   and the transparent tunnel(s) have to be pre-established.
    \ This\n   document provides an automatic solution for finding the nearest\n   upstream
    node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from\n   the current node
    to the root node, and triggering the targeted LDP\n   session and transparent
    tunnel(s) when needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
