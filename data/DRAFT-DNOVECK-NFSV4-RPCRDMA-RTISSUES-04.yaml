abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As currently designed and implemented, the RPC-over-RDMA protocol\n
    \  requires use of multiple internode round trips to process some common\n   operations.
    \ For example, NFS WRITE operations require use of three\n   internode round trips.
    \ This document looks at this issue and\n   discusses what can and what should
    be done to address it, both within\n   the context of an extensible version of
    RPC-over-RDMA and potentially\n   outside that framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
