abstract:
  content: "<p>There is a challenge of providing IPv6 multihoming sites with thebasic
    benefits such as redundancy and load sharing, and at the sametime, scaling the
    global IPv6 routing table. It is equallychallenging to provide a solution which
    is simple enough to beoperational manageable. This document proposes a simple
    solutionwhich meets the requirements and is also operationally manageable.</p>"
