abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n
    \  established in 2005.  In the 13 years from 2005 to 2018, the needs of\n   the
    IETF have evolved in ways that require changes to its\n   administrative structure.
    \ The purpose of this document is to outline\n   a proposed new \"IASA 2.0\" structure
    and to document the decisions\n   made by the IASA2 Working Group over the past
    20 months in developing\n   the proposed structure.  The proposal is for the work
    of the IETF's\n   administrative and fundraising tasks to be conducted by a new\n
    \  administrative organization, the IETF Administration Limited\n   Liability
    Company (\"LLC\").  Under the proposal, the Internet\n   Administrative Oversight
    Committee (IAOC) will be eliminated, and its\n   oversight and advising functions
    transferred to the new LLC Board.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
