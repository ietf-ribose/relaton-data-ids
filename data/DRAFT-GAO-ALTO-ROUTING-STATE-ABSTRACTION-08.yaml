abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended\n
    \  the base ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent a more\n   detailed
    view of the network which contains not only end-to-end costs\n   but also information
    about shared bottlenecks.\n\n   However, the view computed by straw man algorithms
    can contain\n   redundant information and result in unnecessary communication\n
    \  overhead.  The situation gets even worse when certain ALTO extensions\n   are
    enabled, for example, the incremental update extension\n   [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse]
    which continuously pushes data\n   changes to ALTO clients.  Redundant information
    can trigger\n   unnecessary updates.\n\n   In this document, several algorithms
    are described which can\n   effectively reduce the redundancy in the network view
    while still\n   providing the same information as in the original path vectors.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
