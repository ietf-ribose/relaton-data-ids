abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's
    device\n   is configured with the user's identities that they wish to use in\n
    \  ABFAB transactions.  This will require something on that device,\n   either
    built into the operating system or a standalone utility, that\n   will manage
    the user's identities and identity to service mappings.\n   Anyone designing that
    \"something\" will face the same set of\n   challenges.  This document aims to
    document these challenges with the\n   aim of producing well-thought out UIs with
    some degree of\n   consistency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
