abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646, Unicode] covers a verywide
    repertoire of characters. The IETF, in [RFC 2277], requires thatfuture IETF protocols
    support UTF-8 [RFC 2279], an ASCII-compatibleencoding of UCS. The wide range of
    characters included in the UCS haslead to some cases of duplicate encodings. This
    document proposesthat in IETF protocols, the class of duplicates called canonicalequivalents
    be dealt with by using Early Uniform Normalizationaccording to Unicode Normalization
    Form C, Canonical Composition (NFC)[UTR15]. This document describes both Early
    Uniform Normalizationand Normalization Form C.</p>"
