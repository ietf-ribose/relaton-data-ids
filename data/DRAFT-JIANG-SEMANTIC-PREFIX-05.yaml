abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a framework method that network operations\n
    \  may use their addresses.  Network operators, who have large IPv6\n   address
    space, may choose to embedded some semantics into IPv6\n   addresses by assigning
    additional significance to specific bits\n   within the prefix.  By embedded semantics
    into IPv6 prefixes, the\n   semantics of packets can be inspected easily.  Routers
    and other\n   intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required.\n
    \  Packet-level differentiation can also enable flow-level and user-\n   level
    differentiation.  Consequently, the network operators can\n   accordingly treat
    network packets differently and efficiently.  The\n   management and maintenance
    of networks can be much simpler.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
