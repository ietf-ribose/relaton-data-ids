abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines requirements that need to be met in IP-based\nnetworks
    to enable and support communications for National\nSecurity/Emergency Preparedness
    (NS/EP) operations.  It provides a\ntemplate from which an emergency service can
    be negotiated and\nprovides a set of requirements that should be met for acceptable\nemergency
    communication services.  The focus here is on network\nrequirements, rather than
    requirements for particular applications.\nThe requirements are general and are
    intended to provide wide\nlatitude in implementation options for service providers.\n\n\t
