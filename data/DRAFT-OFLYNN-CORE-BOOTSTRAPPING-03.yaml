abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet of Things is marching its way towards completion.
    \ Nodes\ncan use standards from the 6LoWPAN and ROLL WG to achieve IP\nconnectivity.
    \ IEEE Standards ensure connectivity at lower layers for\nresource-constrained
    devices.  Yet a central problem remains at a\nmore basic layer without a suitable
    answer: how to initially\nconfigure the network.  Without configuration the network
    never\nadvances beyond a large box of nodes.  Current solutions tend to be\nspecific
    to a certain vendor, node type, or application.\n\nThis document outlines exactly
    what problems are faced in solving\nthis problem.  General problems faced in any
    low-power wireless\nnetwork are outlined first; followed by how these apply to\nbootstrapping.
    \ A selection of currently proposed techniques is\npresented.  From these a more
    generic approach is presented, which\ncan solve the problem for a wide range of
    situations.\n\nAn emphasis is on performing this bootstrapping in a secure manner.\nThis
    document does not cover operation of the network securely.  This\ndocument does
    provide the basis for allowing the network to operate\nsecurely however, by providing
    standard methods for key exchanges and\nauthentication.\n\t </p>\n      "
