abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent targeted LDP (tLDP) applications such as remote loop-free\n
    \  alternate (LFA) and BGP auto discovered pseudowire may automatically\n   establish
    a tLDP session to any LSR in a network.  The initiating LSR\n   has information
    about the targeted applications to administratively\n   control initiation of
    the session. However, the responding LSR has no\n   such information to control
    acceptance of this session. This document\n   defines a mechanism to advertise
    and negotiate Targeted Applications\n   Capability (TAC) during LDP session initialization.
    \ As the\n   responding LSR becomes aware of targeted applications, it may\n   establish
    a limited number of tLDP sessions for certain applications.\n   In addition, each
    targeted application is mapped to LDP Forwarding\n   Equivalence Class (FEC) Elements
    to advertise only necessary LDP FEC-\n   label bindings over the session.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
