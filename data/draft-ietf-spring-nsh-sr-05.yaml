abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the integration of Network Service Header (NSH)
    [RFC8300] and Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402], as well as encapsulation details,
    to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665] in an efficient manner while
    maintaining separation of the service and transport planes as originally intended
    by the SFC architecture. Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for
    steering packets between Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given Service
    Function Path (SFP) while NSH has the responsibility for maintaining the integrity
    of the service plane, the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata. The
    integration described in this document demonstrates that NSH and SR can work jointly
    and complement each other leaving the network operator with the flexibility to
    use whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas of their network
    infrastructure, and still maintain an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</p>"
