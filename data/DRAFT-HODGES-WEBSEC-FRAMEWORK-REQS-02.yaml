abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Web-based malware and attacks are proliferating rapidly on
    the\n   Internet.  New web security mechanisms are also rapidly growing in\n   number,
    although in an incoherent fashion.  This document provides a\n   brief overview
    of the present situation and the various seemingly\n   piece-wise approaches being
    taken to mitigate the threats.  It then\n   provides an overview of requirements
    as presently being expressed by\n   the community in various online and face-to-face
    discussions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
