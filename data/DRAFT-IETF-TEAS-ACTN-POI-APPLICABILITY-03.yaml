abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and
    Control\n   of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration\n
    \  (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and Optical internetworking. It\n   identifies
    the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support\n   this deployment
    architecture and specific scenarios relevant for\n   Service Providers.\n\n   Existing
    IETF protocols and data models are identified for each\n   multi-layer (packet
    over optical) scenario with a specific focus on\n   the MPI (Multi-Domain Service
    Coordinator to Provisioning Network\n   Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
