abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution for point to multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
    Engineering (TE). The objective is to optimize packet replication and minimize
    state and intelligence in the core of the network, while performing P2MP TE. The
    solution relies on RSVP-TE in the core of the network. It is based on setting
    up a P2MP LSP by merging P2P LSPs in the network. The setup of P2P LSPs is source
    intiated. Simple enhancements are made to RSVP-TE to facilitate the set up of
    a P2MP TE LSP. There is no need to run a multicast routing protocol in the network
    core. There can be various applications for P2MP TE LSPs such as multicast. Specification
    of how such applications will use a P2MP LSP is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
