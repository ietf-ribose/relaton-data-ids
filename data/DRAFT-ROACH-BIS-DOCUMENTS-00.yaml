abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses mechanisms the IETF has historically
    used for\n   updating RFCs subsequent to their publication, and outlines an\n
    \  updated procedure for publishing newer versions (colloquially known\n   as
    \"bis versions\") that is appropriate in certain circumstances.\n   This procedure
    is expected to be easier for both authors and\n   consumers of RFCs.\n\n\t </p>\n
