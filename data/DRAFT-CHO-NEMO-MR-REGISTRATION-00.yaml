abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In multihomed mobile networks, multiple Mobile Routers can
    be \n   deployed to provide fault recovery or load sharing. Also, each Mobile
    \n   Router (MR) can have a bi-directional tunnel with its own Home Agent \n   (HA).
    In this multihomed mobile network scenario, the neighbor root \n   MR can replace
    or share the operation of another MR. Therefore, MRs \n   should cooperate with
    each other to provide session continuity or \n   load sharing. We present an authentication
    and registration mechanism \n   without introducing extra signaling messages.
    Using the Return\n   Routability procedure of Mobile IPv6 and the Binding Update
    message  \n   with the neighbor MR registration option, the MR can authenticate
    and \n   register the neighbor MR to its own HA. And the HA can use this \n   registered
    neighbor MR information to provide fault recovery or load \n   sharing. \n\t </p>\n
