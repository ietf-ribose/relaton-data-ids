abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector
    \n(ITU-T) has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify \ndirectory
    services architectures in support of multimedia \nconferencing protocols. The
    goal of the architecture is to \n'directory enable' multimedia conferencing so
    that these services \ncan leverage existing identity management and enterprise
    \ndirectories. A particular goal is to enable an enterprise or service \nprovider
    to maintain a canonical source of users and their \nmultimedia conferencing systems,
    so that multiple call servers from \nmultiple vendors, supporting multiple protocols,
    can all access the \nsame data store. \n   \nBecause SIP is an IETF standard,
    the contents of H.350 and H.350.4 \nare made available via this document to the
    IETF community. \n\t </p>\n      "
