abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an extension of the Quality of Service (QoS)architecture
    to support differentiated resilience requirements of IPservices.Several architectures
    offering Quality of Service in IP-basednetworks are defined by the IETF community.
    The two most importantof them are the Integrated Services (IntServ) model with
    theResource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) as the recommended signalingprotocol and
    the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model. Recently,Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) emerged introducing extendedtraffic engineering methods into IP and therefore
    also may supportQoS.Due to the growing commercial importance of the Internet and
    thetransport of mission-critical services, survivability became a mainservice
    requirement in addition to the traditional QoS.</p>"
