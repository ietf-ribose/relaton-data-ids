abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP). This Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to control the authority
    delegation of one of its resources to another Endpoint. All the phases of the
    authority delegation process (setup, renewal, cancellation) are controlled by
    a simple RESTful protocol. This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking
    relation type, to be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly advertise the resources
    that it can serve from its cache, or by forwarding the Client request upstream
    (either to the origin, or to another Proxy).</p>"
