abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the ongoing challenges in dealing with the massive number
    of\n   streams that RTCWEB implementations may wish to instantiate and\n   manipulate
    is the ability to add and remove streams in a way that\n   avoids the condition
    known as \"glare.\"  This document describes a\n   non-normative set of behaviors
    that RTCWEB implementations can\n   implement to completely avoid inducing a glare
    condition.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
