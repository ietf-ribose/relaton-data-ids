abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working
    Group\n   was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use\n
    \  by that working group.  RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers\n   that
    were assigned in that arc.  A small number of object identifiers\n   that were
    assigned in RFC 4212 are not included in RFC 7299, and this\n   document corrects
    that oversight.  This document updates RFC 7299.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
