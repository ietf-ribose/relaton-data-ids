abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP conferencing framework defines a model for tightly-coupled
    conferencing signaled via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), in which a Conference
    Policy Control Protocol is used to manipulate policies relevant to a specific
    conference, such as conference membership policy, authorization policy, and media
    layout. This document describes a logical model, which can apply to any session
    setup protocol, to describe media processing in a tightly-coupled conference.
    It also defines specific protocol semantics and a specific syntax to manipulate
    that model.</p>"
