abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a mobile device (referred to as Station (STA)) tries to
    connect\n   to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), it needs to first perform\n
    \  mutual authentication with the EAP server of the network.  As a\n   result
    of successful authentication, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will\n   be generated,
    and distributed to the STA and the Authenticator of the\n   network by the EAP
    server respectively.  The PMK is used for securing\n   the subsequent communications
    between the STA and the Wireless\n   Termination Point (WTP) it attaches to.  In
    practice, the\n   authenticator may not be deployed on the WTP.  In this case,
    an\n   approach is required to help the WTP to obtain the PMK.  This work\n   tries
    to discuss the issues related with this topic and proposes a\n   RADIUS extension
    to address the problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
