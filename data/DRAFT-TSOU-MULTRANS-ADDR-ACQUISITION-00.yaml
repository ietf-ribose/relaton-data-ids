abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a typical IP television (IPTV) system, the receiver acquires\n
    \  information about available program content, the subscriber selects a\n   program
    to watch, and the receiver signals to the network to begin\n   receiving the program
    in the form of multicast content.  The program\n   content information is typically
    XML-encoded, can be transmitted in\n   multiple segments, possibly over multiple
    channels, but includes\n   media stream descriptions for the individual program
    descriptions\n   that may also be XML-encoded or may use the Session Description\n
    \  Protocol (SDP, RFC 4566).  The media stream descriptions provide\n   multicast
    group and unicast source addresses that are used in the\n   subsequent signalling
    to the network.\n\n   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur
    where\n   the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported\n
    \  by the source.  This memo examines and evaluates alternative\n   strategies
    for allowing the receiver to acquire addresses in such\n   scenarios in the version
    it supports.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
