abstract:
- content: <p>Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto]
    requires configuration of a "VP-range list" in ASBRs connected to transit and
    peer ISPs. These ASBRs simply tag some routes whose prefix falls within the VP-Range
    with a "can- suppress" tag to indicate whether these routes should be FIB installed.
    This draft specified an extended auto-configuration mechanism in Virtual Aggregation
    to support the configuration of both "VP-List" and "popular prefixes". Specifically,
    based on this mechanism, the ratio of lost packets when VP routes fail could be
    minimized.</p>
