abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As e-mail use is becoming more prevalent and the applications
    of  its\n   use  more  diverse  it is increasingly becoming a burden to users
    and\n   system administration staff to maintain message stores and 'weed-out'\n
    \  obsolete  messages.   The  problem  also manifests itself as a direct\n   cost
    to organisations trying to maintain storage space  for  user  e-\n   mail  messages
    where a considerable proportion of messages are simply\n   forgotten and lay dormant.\n
    \n   RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying  details\n   about
    \ US-ASCII  message  headers.   As an extension to this protocol\n   this memo
    proposes the introduction of an additional header to enable\n   e-mail messages
    to 'self-destruct' after a specified period depending\n   on a number of  conditions
    \ that  may  have  been  specified  by  the\n   originator  or  can  subsequently
    be (re-)specified by the recipient.\n   This memo also proposes possible client
    \ and  server  implementations\n   with  a  view  of  soliciting  feedback  and
    \ further refining of the\n   extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
