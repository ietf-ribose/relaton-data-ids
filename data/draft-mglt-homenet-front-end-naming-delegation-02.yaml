abstract:
- content: "<p>CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks. Most
    CPEs assigns IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which makes it a good
    candidate for hosting the naming service. With IPv6, the naming service makes
    nodes reachable from the home network as well as from the Internet. However, CPEs
    have not been designed to host such a naming service. More specifically, CPE have
    been designed neither to host a service exposed on the Internet, nor to support
    heavy operations like zone signing. Both MAY expose the CPEs to resource exhaustion
    which would make the home network unreachable, and most probably would also affect
    the home network inner communications. In addition, DNSSEC management and configuration
    may not be well understood or mastered by regular end users. Misconfiguration
    MAY also results in naming service disruption, thus these end users MAY prefer
    to rely on third party naming providers. This document describes a homenet naming
    architecture where the CPEs manage the DNS zone associates to its home network,
    and outsource both DNSSEC management and naming service on the Internet to a third
    party designated as the Public Authoritative Servers.</p>"
