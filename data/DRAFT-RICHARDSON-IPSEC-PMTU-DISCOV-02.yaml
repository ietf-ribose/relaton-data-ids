abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the problem of getting accurate Path MTU
    infor-\nmation in the presence of untrusted routers. Typical Path MTU discovery\nis
    done by sending packets with the don't fragment bit set, and listen-\ning for
    ICMP messages from routers that want to fragment the packets.\nUnfortunately,
    these messages could be forged, and IPsec based security\nsystem(s) can not pass
    make direct use of these messages. An alternate,\nbackwards compatible algorithm
    is suggested.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
