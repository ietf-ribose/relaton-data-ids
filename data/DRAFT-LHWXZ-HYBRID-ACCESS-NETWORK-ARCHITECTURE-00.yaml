abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In practice, people have realized that it may be difficult
    to update\n   or rebuild existing copper networks when they are deployed in certain\n
    \  areas.  At the same time, the requirements of customers on bandwidth\n   are
    continually increased.  This document tries to discuss the\n   general network
    architectures which could be used to address this\n   problem by bundling multiple
    hybrid access networks together\n   according to the certain management policies.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
