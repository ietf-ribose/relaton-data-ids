abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes several potential scalability issues
    when\n   implementing in-situ OAM based on the current in-situ OAM documents\n
    \  and proposes the corresponding solutions and modifications to the\n   current
    in-situ OAM specification.  Specifically, we extend in-situ\n   OAM to support
    more standard tracing data than is currently defined\n   and add new features
    to avoid limitations on MTU, bandwidth,\n   forwarding path length, and node processing
    capability.  We provide\n   use cases to motivate our proposal and base the changes
    on the\n   current in-situ OAM header format specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
