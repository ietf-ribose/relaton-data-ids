abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses cause
    traceability issues due to their decentralized nature. To minimize the issues
    due to lack of traceability, these self-generated addresses can be registered
    with the network for allowing centralized address administration. This document
    defines a generic address registration solution using DHCPv6, using a new ND option
    and a new DHCPv6 option in order to communicate the use of self-generated addresses.
    A new Addr-registration-request message type is defined for initiate the address
    registration request, among with two new Status codes to indicate registration
    errors on the server side.</p>"
