abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a transfer protocol\n
    \  that was designed to meet the special requirements of constrained\n   environments.\n\n
    \  This document introduces a common framework for conveying\n   authorization
    information between the actors in the ACE architecture\n   by defining classes
    of message types.  It thus specifys a common\n   authorization extension for CoAP.\n\n\t
