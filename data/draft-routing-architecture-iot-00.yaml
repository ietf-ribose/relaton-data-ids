abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified a routing protocol designed
    for the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) also referred to as IP smart objects
    networks or the "Internet of things". Still, the debate of where routing functions
    should occur within the network stack tend to get revived on a regular basis.
    A mesh-under approach places routing functions in the link layer to emulate a
    single broadcast domain where all devices appear as immediate neighbors to the
    network layer. In contrast, a route-over approach places all routing functions
    at the network layer, following the IP architecture. For LLNs, a mesh-under approach
    may seem simple and attractive because it seeks to hide characteristics of multi-hop
    communication through the LLN from the network layer. However, resource constraints
    and dynamic link characteristics limit to what extent link-layer routing can hide
    those characteristics. This document presents architectural issues of using a
    mesh-under approach in LLNs and how a route-over approach does not suffer from
    these issues.</p>
