abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified a routing protocol designedfor
    the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) also referred to as IPsmart objects networks
    or the \"Internet of things\". Still, thedebate of where routing functions should
    occur within the networkstack tend to get revived on a regular basis. A mesh-under
    approachplaces routing functions in the link layer to emulate a singlebroadcast
    domain where all devices appear as immediate neighbors tothe network layer. In
    contrast, a route-over approach places allrouting functions at the network layer,
    following the IParchitecture.For LLNs, a mesh-under approach may seem simple and
    attractivebecause it seeks to hide characteristics of multi-hop communicationthrough
    the LLN from the network layer. However, resourceconstraints and dynamic link
    characteristics limit to what extentlink-layer routing can hide those characteristics.
    This documentpresents architectural issues of using a mesh-under approach in LLNsand
    how a route-over approach does not suffer from these issues.</p>"
