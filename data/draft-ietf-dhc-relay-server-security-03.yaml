abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no guidance
    for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents. The Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used
    to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents, but does not require
    encryption. And, with recent concerns about pervasive monitoring and other attacks,
    it is appropriate to require securing relay to relay and relay to server communication
    for DHCPv6 and relay to server communication for DHCPv4.</p>"
