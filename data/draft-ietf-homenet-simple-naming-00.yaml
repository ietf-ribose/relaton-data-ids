abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a simple name resolution and service discovery
    architecture for homenets, using the 'home.arpa' domain name hierarchy. This architecture
    covers local publication of names, as well as name resolution service for local
    and global names for devices connected to the homenet. This document does not
    cover discovery of homenet services by devices not connected to the homenet, nor
    DNSSEC, nor acquisition and configuration of a global name as an alternative to
    'home.arpa'. These topics will be addressed in a separate document.</p>"
