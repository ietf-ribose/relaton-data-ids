abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths\n
    \  consisting of one or more segment lists with necessary path\n   attributes.
    \ For each SR path, it may also have its own path\n   attributes, and Path Segment
    is one of them.  A Path Segment is\n   defined to identify an SR path, which can
    be used for performance\n   measurement, path correlation, and end-2-end path
    protection.  Path\n   Segment can be also used to correlate two unidirctional
    SR paths into\n   a bidirectional SR path which is required in some scenarios,
    for\n   example, mobile backhaul transport network.\n\n   This document defines
    extensions to BGP to distribute SR policies\n   carrying Path Segment and bidirectional
    path information.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
