abstract:
  content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systemswithin
    the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border GatewayProtocol [BGP], which
    is used to provide routing information betweenautonomous systems. This document
    proposes a system where the originof any advertisement within BGP can be verified
    and authenticated,preventing the advertisement of prefix blocks by unauthorizednetworks,
    and verifying that the final destination in the path isactually within the autonomous
    system to which the packets are beingrouted.</p>"
