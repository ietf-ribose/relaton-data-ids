abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the main questions posed during recent discussions on\n
    \  distributed mobility architectures is if the distributed architecture\n   can
    have advantages in terms of costs with respect to a centralized\n   one.\n\n   This
    draft describes a general method to calculate the costs of the\n   centralized
    and distributed scenarios.  Even if a simplified model\n   has been used, some
    information can be earned.  Each operator can use\n   this model and his own costs
    to discover the optimal architecture\n   based on traffic observed in the network.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
