abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As systems increasingly are able to run video at 60 frames
    per\n   second, there is a need to signal desired frame rate to optimise\n   resolution
    choices and to avoid unnecessary resource or energy usage.\n   This document updates
    RFC6184 and defines a new optional parameter\n   addressing recent extensions
    currently supported in H.323 systems:\n   The signalling of the maximum frames
    per second that can be\n   efficiently received or that can be sent.\n\n\t </p>\n
