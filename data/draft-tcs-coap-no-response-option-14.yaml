abstract:
- content: <p>There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against requests
    from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no response path
    from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource consumption
    in constrained systems while updating a bulk of resources simultaneously, or updating
    a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP already provides a non-confirmable
    (NON) mode of message exchange where the server end-point does not respond with
    ACK. However, obeying the request/response semantics, the server end-point responds
    back with a status code indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and
    satisfy the request". This document introduces a header option for CoAP called
    'No- Response'. Using this option the client can explicitly tell the server to
    suppress all responses against the particular request. This option also provides
    granular control to enable suppression of a particular class of response or a
    combination of response-classes. This option may be effective for both unicast
    and multicast requests. This document also discusses a few exemplary applications
    which benefit from this option.</p>
