abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide a reference framework
    for\n   datacenter operators planning for a migration of their\n   infrastructures
    to IPv6.  It aims to offer a scheme for evaluating\n   different products and
    architectures, and therefore it is also\n   addressed to manufacturers and solution
    providers, so they can use it\n   to gauge their solutions.  We believe this will
    translate in a\n   smoother and faster transition of these infrastuctures into
    IPv6\n\n   The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation,\n
    \  and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does\n   not
    consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services\n   provided by
    applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6\n   beyond the specific aspects
    related to how their deployment on the DC\n   infrastructure.\n\n   Apart from
    facilitating the migration procedure itself, the\n   mechanisms outlined here
    are intended to make this migration as\n   transparent as possible (if not completely
    transparent) to\n   applications and services running on the DC infrastructure,
    as well\n   as to take advantage of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations,\n
    \  internally and across the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
