abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number
    of\n   different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity\n   implies
    that different security mechanisms are needed to provide\n   services such as
    confidentiality, integrity and source authentication\n   of RTP/RTCP packets suitable
    for the various environments.  The range\n   of solutions makes it difficult for
    RTP-based application developers\n   to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This
    document provides an\n   overview of a number of security solutions for RTP, and
    gives\n   guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security\n
    \  mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
