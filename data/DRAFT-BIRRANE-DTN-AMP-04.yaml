abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a concise binary encoding of components
    of\n   the Asynchronous Management Model (AMM) and a binary protocol for the\n
    \  exchange of these items over a nertwork.  The intent of this protocol\n   is
    to provide an efficient exchange of management encoding that\n   conserves computing
    resources for embedded devices and energy\n   necessary for transmission of protocol
    data units.  AMP is designed\n   to reduce the number of transmitted bytes, operates
    without sessions\n   or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autnomously
    when there\n   is no timely contact with a network operator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
