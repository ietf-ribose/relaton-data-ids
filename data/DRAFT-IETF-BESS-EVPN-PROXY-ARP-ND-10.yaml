abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the EVPN Proxy-ARP/ND function, augmented
    by\n   the capability of the ARP/ND Extended Community.  Together, these\n   help
    operators of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), Data Centers\n   (DCs), and other
    networks deal with IPv4 and IPv6 address resolution\n   issues associated with
    large Broadcast Domains (DBs) by reducing and\n   even suppressing the flooding
    produced by address resolution in the\n   EVPN network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
