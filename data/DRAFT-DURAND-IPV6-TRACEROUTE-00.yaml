abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The traceroute program has proven very useful and has been\n
    \   extensively used in the Internet for measurement and debugging\n    purposes.
    However, it only shows the originator to target path\n    and gives no indication
    on the reverse path. Source routing may\n    sometimes be used to find it, but
    it's very often disable by\n    intermediary routers.\n    Another problem occurs
    when packets do not follow the same routes:\n    traceroute outputs are very difficult
    to read.\n \n    Other solutions has been proposed to record the route taken by\n
    \   an IPv4 packet. Originally, IPv4 contains an option in which every\n    intermediary
    router can add its address [RFC791]. Unfortunately,\n    the limitation in size
    imposed by the options design of IPv4 limits\n    its use to 9 routers.\n \n    In
    [RFC1393] another strategy was proposed. An new IPv4 option was\n    created.
    When a router receives a packet containing this option,\n    it generates a ICMP
    Echo message to the source. This technique\n    couldn't be widely deployed in
    IPv4 because it needed a change\n    in every single router to be efficient.\n
    \n    These two methods create less traffic on the network and are more\n    accurate,
    since they give the real route taken by packets and are\n    less sensitive to
    fluttering. The IPv6 deployment could be the\n    opportunity to widely deploy
    a new traceroute mechanism based on\n    those two methods.\n \n    We propose
    to combine the two previous methods by defining a new\n    hop-by-hop option and
    a new ICMP message type to record the direct\n    path from the originator to
    the target and the reverse path from\n    the target to the originator.\n\n\t
