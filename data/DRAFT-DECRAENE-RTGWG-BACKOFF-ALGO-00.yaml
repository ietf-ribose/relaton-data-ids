abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard algorithm to back-off link-state
    IGP\n   SPF computations.\n\n   This improves interoperability by reducing the
    probability and/or\n   duration of transient forwarding loops during the IGP convergence
    in\n   the area/level when the network reacts to multiple consecutive\n   events.\n\n\n\t
