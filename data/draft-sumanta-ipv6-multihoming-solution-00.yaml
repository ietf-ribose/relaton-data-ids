abstract:
- content: "<p>Ipv6 Multihoming for Host could be implemented using Ipv6-to-Ipv6 Network
    prefix translation (NPTv6), however NPTv6 not ideal as this solution not achieve
    End-to-End transparency of connectivity. Basic issues with End host Multihoming
    architecture without NPTv6 are: 1. Source address selection, 2. Next hop selection
    and 3. DNS resolution. One other approach to solve above mention all three issues
    with End-to-End transparent connectivity would be using policy at End host to
    enforce source address and next hop selection. In this document,a solution being
    propose to solve all above mention three problem enhancing policy based enforcement
    on host directed by router using its router advertisement.This document not obsolete
    any of the previous work,only propose how policy on End-host can be enforce from
    router by mapping destination prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.</p>"
