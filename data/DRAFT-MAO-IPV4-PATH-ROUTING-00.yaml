abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to the IPv4 address shortage
    \n   problem. The solution is to be implemented within the IPv4\n   framework,
    rather than inside a \"next generation\" IP protocol.\n\n   By organizing local
    networks as an \"intranet hierarchy\" attached\n   to the Internet, nodes inside
    the hierarchy can be uniquely addressed\n   with path descriptions. Two IPv4 options,
    Source-Side Path-info and\n   Destination-Side Path-info, are added into the IPv4
    protocol, so that\n   up to 2 path descriptions can be carried in the IPv4 header.
    Further,\n   a currently unused flag bit in the IPv4 header is used to extend
    the\n   logical IPv4 header, so that options can also be carried \"out-band\".\n
    \  \n   Core routers in the Internet will ignore the unrecognized new options\n
    \  and the extension, and thus need not be replaced or updated.\n\t </p>\n      "
