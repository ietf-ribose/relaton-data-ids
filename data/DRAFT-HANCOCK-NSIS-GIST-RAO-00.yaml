abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends
    on\npacket interception to identify the nodes that should participate in\nsignalling
    sessions.  The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis of\nthe packet header as
    the interception algorithm.  This document\ndescribes an experimental extension
    to GIST to use the Router Alert\nOption (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency.
    \ It describes the\ntradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on
    legacy\nequipment and protocol deployability, and also the considerations to\nbe
    taken into account in selecting values for the RAO value field.\n\t </p>\n      "
