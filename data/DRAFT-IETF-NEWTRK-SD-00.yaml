abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"ISD\" model for specifying the definition, status, and
    content of\n   Internet Standards does not appear to be satisfactory for the\n
    \  documents that describe IETF procedures, structure, or relationships\n   with
    other bodies.  Those documents have traditionally be published\n   as BCPs and
    described as \"process\" BCPs.  This document proposes an\n   special document
    series for those process documents, paralleling the\n   ISDs.\n\t </p>\n      "
