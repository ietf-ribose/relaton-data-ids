abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3552 provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text on
    Security\n   Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old. With the\n
    \  threat landscape and security ecosystem significantly changed since\n   the
    RFC was published, RFC3552 is a candidate for update. This draft\n   proposes
    that, prior to drafting an update to RFC3552, an examination\n   of recent, published
    Security Considerations sections be carried out\n   as a baseline for how to improve
    RFC3552. It suggests a methodology\n   for examining Security Considerations sections
    in published RFCs and\n   the extraction of both quantitative and qualitative
    information that\n   could inform a revision of the older guidance.\n\n\t </p>\n
