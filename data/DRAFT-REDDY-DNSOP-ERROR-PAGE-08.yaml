abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a DNS server filters a query, the response to such query
    conveys\n   no detailed explanation that elaborates why that query was blocked,\n
    \  leading thus to end-user confusion.  A solution to this problem is\n   needed
    in order to enhance the user experience.\n\n   This document defines a method
    to return an URI that explains the\n   reason why a DNS query was filtered by
    a DNS server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
