abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft we discuss the attributes and characteristics of
    an\nInternet architecture based on assigning unique identifiers to all\nphysical
    devices, users, services, and agents.  A supporting\nlocation-finding mechanism
    is also defined.  The advantages of such\nas architecture are presented.  Please
    note: this discussion is still\nin the preliminary stages and should be considered
    as such.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
