abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The deployment of carrier-side stateless solution requires
    some\n   particular considerations in mobile network contexts.  The widely\n   existed
    legacy network restricts the development of IP address\n   provisioning based
    on DHCP-PD.  The memo provided several potential\n   approaches to facilitate
    the issues and provide the possibilities\n   leveraging 3GPP mechanism.  The stateless
    algorithm is required to be\n   updated depending to the preferred solution accordingly.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
