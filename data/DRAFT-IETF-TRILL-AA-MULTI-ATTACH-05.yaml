abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) active-active\n
    \  service provides end stations with flow level load balance and\n   resilience
    against link failures at the edge of TRILL campuses as\n   described in RFC 7379.\n\n
    \  This draft specifies a method by which member RBridges in an active-\n   active
    edge RBridge group use their own nicknames as ingress RBridge\n   nicknames to
    encapsulate frames from attached end systems. Thus,\n   remote edge RBridges (who
    are not in the group) will see one host MAC\n   address being associated with
    the multiple RBridges in the group.\n   Such remote edge RBridges are required
    to maintain all those\n   associations (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not flip-flop
    among them\n   which would be the behavior prior to this specification. Design
    goals\n   of this specification are discussed in the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
