abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are times when a user has a pair of protected resources
    that\n   would like to request access to each other.  While OAuth flows\n   typically
    enable the user to grant a client access to a protected\n   resource, granting
    the inverse access requires an additional flow.\n   Reciprical OAuth enables a
    more seemless experience for the user to\n   grant access to a pair of protected
    resources.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
