abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPFIX[RFC3917] mandates the IPFIX device should be reliable.To
    be\nreliable the individual components like the Metering process or the\nExporting
    process should not fail to meter &amp; export the flow\ninformation to the collector,
    else indicate its incapability\nexplicitly.\n\nCurrently, IPFIX transmits failure
    by sending count of packets,flows\nit failed to process along with the duration
    of the failure.\n\nThis document outlines some of the limitations an IPFIX device
    may\nhave and suggests solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
