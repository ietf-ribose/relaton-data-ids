abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat
    Signaling (DOTS) signal channel, a protocol for signaling the need for protection
    against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to a server capable of enabling
    network traffic mitigation on behalf of the requesting client. A companion document
    defines the DOTS data channel, a separate reliable communication layer for DOTS
    management and configuration purposes.</p>"
