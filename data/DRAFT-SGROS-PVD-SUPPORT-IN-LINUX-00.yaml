abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations
    which\n   implemented parts of PvD architecture document.  One implementation\n
    \  was done from scratch (PvD-manager) while another is a part of an\n   existing
    component (NetworkManager).  The implementation of server\n   component was also
    done but only in IPv6 router.  DHCP was ignored\n   due to IPR claims.\n\n\t </p>\n
