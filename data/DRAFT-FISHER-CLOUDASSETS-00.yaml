abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There is no standardized method to describe assets used in
    a cloud\n   such that they can be moved from one cloud to the next independent\n
    \  of the underlying architecture. This document defines Cloud Assets\n   as a
    lightweight description of cloud resources and proposes a\n   standardization
    of Cloud Assets into three major categories:\n   Resource Assets, Component Assets,
    and Composite Assets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
