abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption
    that\nnetworking devices will impartially drop network traffic at their\nperformance
    limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however,\nwill attempt to throttle
    prioritized traffic from network endpoints\nbefore those limits are reached in
    order to minimize the probability\nof frame loss for high value traffic.  Hence,
    existing methodologies\nbased around indiscriminate frame loss are inappropriate
    for DCB\ndevices.  This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based on\nloss
    and extends them to support \"lossless\" Ethernet devices.\n\t </p>\n      "
