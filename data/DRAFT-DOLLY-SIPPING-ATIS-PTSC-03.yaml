abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the 67th San Diego IETF Meeting it is anticipated that the
    Real-time\n   Applications and Infrastructure Area will meet and its ongoing work
    program will be an item for discussion.\n\n   This Internet Draft has been prepared
    to share the relevant portions\n   of the PTSC current work program with the IETF.
    \ It is hoped that\n   awareness of the Packet Technologies Systems Committee
    (PTSC) work\n   program will allow for more informed discussion.\n\n\t </p>\n
