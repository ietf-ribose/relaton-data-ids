abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Per FEC Framework, FEC source packet carries source FEC payload
    ID for \nFEC protection of arbitrary packet flow. Source FEC payload ID will \ncontain
    information identifying the source block and the position within \nthe source
    block. However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, \nthis document
    enables the receiver to get this information without \nappending source FEC payload
    ID. This information is obtained using the \ncombination of information provided
    in the FEC payload header and source \nFEC payload mapping information unit (MIU).
    Therefore, both non-FEC-\ncapable and FEC-capable receivers can work together
    in a multicast \nsession. Two ways to signal the source block structure are defined,
    one \nfor general procedure and anther for systematic procedure that the order
    \nof the packets in the source block is deterministic.\n\t </p>\n      "
