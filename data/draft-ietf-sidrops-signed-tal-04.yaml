abstract:
- content: "<p>Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) [I-D.ietf-sidrops-https-tal] are used
    by Relying Parties in the RPKI to locate and validate Trust Anchor certificates
    used in RPKI validation. This document defines an RPKI signed object for Trust
    Anchor Keys (TAK), that can be used by Trust Anchors to signal their set of current
    keys and the location(s) of the accompanying CA certiifcates to Relying Parties,
    as well as changes to this set in the form of revoked keys and new keys, in order
    to support both planned and unplanned key rolls without impacting RPKI validation.</p>"
