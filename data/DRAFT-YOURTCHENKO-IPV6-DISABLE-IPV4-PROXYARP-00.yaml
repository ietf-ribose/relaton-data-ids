abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   rfc3927 defines the behavior \"Proxy ARP for Everything\" in
    case the\n   only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local.  However, it\n
    \  does not specify anything about the presence or absence of IPv6\n   global
    addressing.  This results in the hosts assuming it has both\n   IPv4 and IPv6
    connectivity in the scenario where the host itself is\n   dualstack-enabled, but
    the network supplies only IPv6 configuration\n   information.  Some implementations
    in this case may decide to use\n   IPv4, which results in long connection delays.
    \ This document\n   proposes to avoid the \"Proxy ARP for Everything\" behavior
    if the host\n   has been assigned an IPv6 address.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
