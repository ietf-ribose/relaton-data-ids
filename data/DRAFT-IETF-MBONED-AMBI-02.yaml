abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines Asymmetric Manifest-Based Integrity (AMBI).\n
    \  AMBI allows each receiver or forwarder of a stream of multicast\n   packets
    to check the integrity of the contents of each packet in the\n   data stream.
    \ AMBI operates by passing cryptographically verifiable\n   hashes of the data
    packets inside manifest messages, and sending the\n   manifests over authenticated
    out-of-band communication channels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
