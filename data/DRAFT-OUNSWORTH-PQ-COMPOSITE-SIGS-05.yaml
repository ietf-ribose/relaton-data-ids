abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will
    come\n   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum
    algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to
    be performed in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the
    component algorithms individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for
    holding composite signature\n   data.\n\n   This document defines the structures
    CompositeSignatureValue, and\n   CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective
    structure for\n   each component algorithm.  This document also defines processes
    for\n   generating and verifying composite signatures.  This document makes\n
    \  no assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided that\n   their
    algorithm identifiers and signature generation and verification\n   processes
    are defined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
