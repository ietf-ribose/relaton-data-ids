abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, Service Function Chaining (SFC) that span domains
    with\n   different technology, administration or ownership are being defined\n
    \  by the SFC WG.  This document focuses on how the Application Layer\n   Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol can be used to advertise and\n   discover abstract
    topology, resource and service information from\n   different domains, and then
    compute inter-domain service function\n   paths.  Another important concern of
    this draft is to initiate a\n   discussion (ALTO, SFC as well as other WGs) regarding
    if, how, and\n   under what conditions ALTO can be useful to improve the multi-domain\n
    \  SFC process.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
