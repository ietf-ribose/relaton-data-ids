abstract:
- content: <p>ACP 142 defines P_MUL, which is a protocol for reliable multicast suitable
    for bandwidth constrained and delayed acknowledgement (Emissions Control or "EMCON")
    environments running over UDP. This document is a specification of the basic protocol
    for electronic mail transfer over ACP 142 to enable MTA to MTA transfer. It explains
    how MULE can be used in conjunction with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC 5321),
    including some common SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA to MTA transfer
    mechanism.</p>
