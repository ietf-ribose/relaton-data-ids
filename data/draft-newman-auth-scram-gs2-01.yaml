abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
    Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over
    a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of
    a challenge response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately,
    the challenge response mechanisms presently on the standards track all fail to
    meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment, and have had success only
    in limited use. This specification describes an authentication mechanism called
    the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses
    the security concerns and meets the deployability requirements. When used in combination
    with TLS or an equivalent security layer, SCRAM could improve the status-quo for
    application protocol authentication and provide a suitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement
    mechanism for future application protocol standards. The purpose of this document
    is to describe the general SCRAM protocol, and how it is used in the GSS-API environment.
    Through GS2, this makes the protocol available in the SASL environment as well.</p>"
