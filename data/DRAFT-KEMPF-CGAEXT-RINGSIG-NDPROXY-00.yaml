abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        RFC 3971 and 3972 (SEND) define a protocol for securing
    \n        resolution of a statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 address to a \n        link
    address as defined by IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. SEND does \n        this by requiring
    the autoconfigured addresses to be \n        cryptographically generated by the
    host from an RSA public \n        key. However, one drawback of SEND is that such
    addresses \n        cannot be securely proxied. Proxy Neighbor Discovery is \n
    \       important for Mobile IPv6 and in certain other cases. In this \n        document,
    we describe an extension of SEND to addresses that \n        are cryptographically
    generated using multiple public keys, \n        called multi-key CGAs. Neighbor
    Discovery messages for multi-\n        key CGAs are signed with an RSA ring signature,
    a type of \n        signature that can be generated using the private key of any
    \n        node from a group of nodes but which requires the public keys \n        of
    all group members to verify. Multi-key CGAs can be securely \n        proxied
    by all nodes that contribute keys to the address. The \n        advantage of multi-key
    CGAs over other techniques of secure \n        address proxying, such as trusting
    the router or using an \n        attribute certificate, is that it preserves location
    privacy. \n        A receiver cannot determine from the IPv6 address, ring \n
    \       signature, or cryptographic parameters whether the node or the \n        proxy
    is defending the address, and hence whether the node is \n        on or off the
    link.  \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
