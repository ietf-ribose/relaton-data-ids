abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       Dual-Stack Lite, combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier
    Grade NAT\n       technologies, provides an approach that offers IPv4 service
    via IPv6\n       network by sharing IPv4 addresses among customers during IPv6\n
    \      transition period. Dual-stack lite, however, requires CGN to maintain\n
    \      active NAT sessions, which means processing performance, memory size\n
    \      and log abilities for NAT sessions should scale with number of\n       sessions
    of subscribers; Hence increasing in CAPEX for operators\n       would be resulted
    in when traffic increase.\n\n       This document propose the NAT offload extensions
    to DS-Lite, which\n       allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized
    network\n       side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering\n
    \      a trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less performance requirements on AFTR\n
    \      device) and OPEX (e.g., easy and fast deployment of Dual-Stack Lite)\n
    \      for operators. The ability of easily co-deploying with basic Dual-\n       Stack
    Lite is essential to NAT offload extension to DS-Lite.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
