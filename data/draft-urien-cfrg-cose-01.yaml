abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an architecture named "Cloud of Secure Elements
    (CoSE)" whose goal is to strengthen the Internet trust. A Secure element (SE)
    provides secure services thanks to various means such as tamper resistant technologies
    or software virtualization techniques. Secure elements are hosted in dedicated
    servers (i.e. Trusted Secure Elements Servers, TSES); they provide secure storage
    facilities or compute cryptographic procedures. Secure elements resources are
    identified by dedicated URIs and should also support HTTP interface. Users are
    equipped with "Access Credential" and thanks to the Secure Transport Protocol
    (STP-TSES) remotely access to Secure Element embedded resources. The RACS (Remote
    APDU Call Secure) and its associated framework protocol is an early proof of concept
    of the CoSE concept.</p>
