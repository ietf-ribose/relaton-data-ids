abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not
    render\nthe same picture and the associated audio at the same moment.  The\nvariation
    in end-to-end delay that resulted in such asynchronous\nplayback between users
    is referred to as inter-user playback delay.\nUnicast based rapid acquisition
    of multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) as\nspecified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp]
    is an important\ntechnique in achieving fast channel switching in IPTV as well
    as\nother multicast applications.  In addition, RAMS also significantly\nrelaxes
    the requirement of relatively short random access point\nperiod in encoding of
    video streams in multicast applications, thus\nallowing significantly improved
    compression efficiency.  However, on\nthe other hand, the use of RAMS increases
    inter-user playback delay,\nwhich makes users receiving the same multicast session
    playback the\nsame content asynchronously.  This document specifies a mechanism
    to\nhelp reduce inter-user playback delay caused by the use of RAMS.\n\t </p>\n
