abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer
    mode\n    capability.  Therefore it is quite natural that there appears\n    following
    demands.  (1)Transmit specific IP flow through a certain\n    isochronous channel
    of IEEE1394 bus.  (2)Transmit specific AV flow\n    (such as MPEG2-TS with CIP
    header[61883]) through a certain\n    isochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus (and
    control these flows by IP\n    applications).  To realize these, this draft proposes
    the protocol\n    with following features.  (1)Notify the relation between channel
    ID\n    and IP flow.  (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronous\n    channel.
    (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted through\n    the channel.  (4)Notify
    the attribute of the flow. This protocol is\n    defined as the extension of MCAP
    (Multicast Channel Allocation\n    Protocol).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
