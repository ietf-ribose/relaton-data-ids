abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan European in- vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special
    form of emergency calls placed by vehicles. eCall deployment is required in the
    very near future in European Union member states, and eCall (and eCall- compatible
    systems) are also being deployed in other regions. eCall provides an integrated
    voice path and a standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and
    location data. An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized form of emergency
    call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP) capable of processing the vehicle data and trained in handling emergency
    calls from vehicles. Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular
    telephony; work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet- switched
    eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this document assists in that work by
    describing how to support eCall within the IP-based emergency services infrastructure.
    This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional
    Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.</p>
