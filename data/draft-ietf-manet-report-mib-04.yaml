abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring autonomous report generation on any device
    that supports MIBs containing objects that resolve to type Integer32 (i.e., Integer32,
    Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks). to be used for performance monitoring. This allows
    a management station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be collected
    either through notifications to the management station or queried asynchronously
    by the management station. Hence, this capability allows network operators to
    reduce the SNMP polling traffic burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant
    Networks which is problematic of SNMP performance management applications.</p>"
