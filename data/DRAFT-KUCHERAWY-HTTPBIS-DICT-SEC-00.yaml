abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data compression algorithms benefit from blocks of tuning data
    called\n   \"dictionaries\".  These can greatly improve data compression speed\n
    \  and/or ratios, but their use and application has numerous potential\n   security
    issues of concern to the communities using them.  This\n   document enumerates
    security issues known about compression\n   dictionaries at the time of publication
    so that future proposals for\n   use of dictionaries can benefit from this collected
    material.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
