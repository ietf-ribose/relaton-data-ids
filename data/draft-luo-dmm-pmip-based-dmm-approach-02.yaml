abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
    management for mobile nodes (MN). For supporting Distributed Mobility Management
    based on current PMIP standard, enhanced Proxy Mobile IPv6 (ePMIP) with two new
    logic functions is introduced. (1) Location Management Function (LMF), (2) Distributed
    Anchoring Function (DAF), including Distributed Routing sub-Function (DRF) and
    Distributed Mobility sub-Function (DMF). Basic signalling procedures and considerations
    are also described in this document.</p>"
