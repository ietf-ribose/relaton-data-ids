abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile
    (CPP)\n   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements\n
    \  to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or\n   IP
    TV).  The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be\n   supported by
    the underlying transport network together with a\n   reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity
    needs.  Appropriate\n   performance metrics such as one-way delay or one-way delay
    variation\n   are used to characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and\n
    \  restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.\n\n   Such a generic
    CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation\n   of the service negotiation
    and activation procedures, thus\n   accelerating service provisioning, (2) set
    (traffic) objectives of\n   Traffic Engineering functions and service management
    functions and\n   (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision-\n
    \  making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
