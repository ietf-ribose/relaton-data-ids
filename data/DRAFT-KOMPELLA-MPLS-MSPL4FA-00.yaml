abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Slice Selector is packet metadata that dictates the packet's\n
    \  forwarding handling in order to conform to its slice requirements.\n   There
    are multiple proposals for carrying slice selectors in MPLS\n   networks.  One
    of the more practical proposals is the \"Global\n   Identifier for Slice Selector\"
    (GISS).  Global uniqueness requires\n   the GISS label be identified as such,
    via a special purpose label\n   (ideally a base special purpose label (bSPL)).
    \ However, bSPLs are a\n   precious commodity, and there are many requests for
    them.  This\n   document serves two purposes: to define a bSPL for carrying a
    GISS,\n   and to show how this bSPL can consolidate many current requests for\n
    \  special purpose labels while carrying associated data compactly and\n   efficiently.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
