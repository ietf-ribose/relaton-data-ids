abstract:
- content: "<p>Flex Ethernet (FlexE) technology, which is defined by Optical Internetworking
    Forum (OIF), is a new kind of data plane technology and can be used to provides
    a generic mechanism for supporting a variety of Ethernet MAC rates that may or
    may not correspond to any existing Ethernet PHY rate. This includes MAC rates
    that are greater than (through bonding) and less than (through sub-rate and channelization)
    the standard Ethernet PHY rates. Based on the applications/use cases given in
    the Flex Ethernet Implementation Agreement [FlexE-IA], this document defines a
    framework and control plane requirements for the application of existing GMPLS
    architecture and control plane protocols to the control of flexible Ethernet network.
    The actual extensions to the GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.</p>"
