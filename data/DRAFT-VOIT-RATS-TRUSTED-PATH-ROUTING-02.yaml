abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like
    IPSec\n   alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly\n
    \  sensitive traffic flows.  These end-users want their flows to\n   traverse
    devices which have been freshly appraised and verified.\n   This specification
    describes Trusted Path Routing.  Trusted Path\n   Routing protects sensitive flows
    as they transit a network by\n   forwarding traffic to/from sensitive subnets
    across network devices\n   recently appraised as trustworthy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
