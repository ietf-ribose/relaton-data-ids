abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Bundled session applications such as FTP, H.323, SIP and RTSP,
    which \nuse a signaling/control connection to establish a data/media flow, \nare
    usually broken, en-route, by Middleboxes such as NAT. Midcom \nproposes to solve
    this problem by allowing the Middlebox to be \ncontrolled through a generalized
    control interface by an \napplication-aware entity called Midcom Agent. Since
    ubiquitous \ndeployment of Midcom is still a few years away, an interim solution
    \nis needed to allow applications traverse NAT and Firewalls \nseamlessly without
    the help of embedded Application Layer Gateways \n(ALG). In this draft, a pre-Midcom
    solution framework is developed. \nA solution for the problem of NAT/FW traversal
    is needed both for \nthe signaling and media/data paths. Two key components of
    the \nproposed solution are: (1) a Signaling Proxy server on the signaling \npath,
    and (2) a Media Proxy server on the media path. The Signaling \nserver interacts
    with the Media server through a control interface. \nAlthough the primary applicability
    of this framework is shown for \nreal-time RTP/UDP-based SIP multimedia sessions,
    these concepts \nshould be generally applicable to other types of data sessions
    \nestablished through a control connection.\n\t </p>\n      "
