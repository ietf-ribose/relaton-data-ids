abstract:
  content: <p>This document introduces a new way to provide returned location information
    in LoST responses that is either of a completed or similar form to the original
    input civic location, based on whether valid or invalid civic address elements
    are returned within the &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; message. This document defines
    a new extension to the &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; message within the LoST protocol
    [RFC5222] that enables the LoST protocol to return in a response a completed civic
    address element set for a valid location response, and one or more suggested sets
    of similar location information for an invalid location. These two types of civic
    addresses are referred to as either "complete location" or "similar location",
    and are included as a compilation of CAtype xml elements within the existing LoST
    &lt;findServiceResponse&gt; message structure.</p>
