abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to detect whether end-to-end data
    flows share a common bottleneck. It relies on summary statistics that are calculated
    by a data receiver based on continuous measurements and regularly fed to a grouping
    algorithm that runs wherever the knowledge is needed. This mechanism complements
    the coupled congestion control mechanism in draft-welzl-rmcat-coupled-cc.</p>"
