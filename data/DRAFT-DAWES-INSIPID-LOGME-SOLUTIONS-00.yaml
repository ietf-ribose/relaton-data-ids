abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user\n
    \  reported problem and for regression testing if network or user agent\n   software
    is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP
    signalling will take between user agents,\n   and therefore impractical to monitor
    SIP signalling end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes potential solutions to meet
    requirements for\n   adding an indicator to the SIP protocol which can be used
    to mark\n   signalling as of interest to logging.  Such marking will typically
    be\n   applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator\n
    \  and not used in regular user agent signalling.  However, such marking\n   can
    be carried end-to-end including the SIP user agents, even if a\n   session originates
    and terminates in different networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
