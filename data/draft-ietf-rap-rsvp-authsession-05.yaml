abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the representation of a session authorization
    policy element for supporting policy-based per-session authorization and admission
    control. The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information
    between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service
    and to co-ordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes. This document
    describes how a process on a system authorizes the reservation of resources by
    a host and then provides that host with a session authorization policy element
    which can be inserted into a resource reservation protocol (e.g., the Resource
    ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) PATH message) to facilitate proper and secure reservation
    of those resources within the network. We describe the encoding of session authorization
    information as a policy element conforming to the format of a Policy Data object
    (RFC 2750) and provide details relating to operations, processing rules and error
    scenarios. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
