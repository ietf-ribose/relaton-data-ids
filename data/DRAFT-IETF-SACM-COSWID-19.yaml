abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 Software Identification (SWID) tags provide
    an\n   extensible XML-based structure to identify and describe individual\n   software
    components, patches, and installation bundles.  SWID tag\n   representations can
    be too large for devices with network and storage\n   constraints.  This document
    defines a concise representation of SWID\n   tags: Concise SWID (CoSWID) tags.
    \ CoSWID supports a similar set of\n   semantics and features as SWID tags, as
    well as new semantics that\n   allow CoSWIDs to describe additional types of information,
    all in a\n   more memory efficient format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
