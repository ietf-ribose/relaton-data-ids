abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document deprecates some previously specified Key Exchange\n
    \  Method algorithm names as well as defining a few added Modular\n   Exponential
    (MODP) Groups for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  It\n   also updates [RFC4253],
    [RFC4419], [RFC4462], and [RFC5656] by\n   specifying the set key exchange algorithms
    that currently exist and\n   which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented.
    \ New key\n   exchange methods use the SHA-2 family of hashes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
