abstract:
- content: "<p>In nested mobile networks (NEMO), packets that are routed from/to any
    nodes inside the nested NEMO have additional overheads (i.e., bi- directional
    tunnels) and delays. These additional overheads and delays increase respectively
    to the depth of the current location of the node in nested NEMO since the packets
    have to go through all the HAs of the MRs along the path to an endpoint. This
    draft provides a solution to this problem, providing optimizations to the nested
    NEMO concept thereby making it worthwhile to implement the nested NEMO concept.</p>"
