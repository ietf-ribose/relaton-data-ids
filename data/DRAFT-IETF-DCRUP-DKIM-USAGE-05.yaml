abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included
    when\n   DKIM was designed in the last decade are functionally obsolete and in\n
    \  need of immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements\n   to
    those minimaly suitable for operation with currently specified\n   algorithms.\n\n\t
