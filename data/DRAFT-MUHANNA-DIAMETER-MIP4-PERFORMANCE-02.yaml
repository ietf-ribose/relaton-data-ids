abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current Mobile IPv4 deployments use RADIUS based MIPv4 user\nauthentication
    and authorization.  Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application\n[RFC4004] offers another
    method for MIPv4 authentication,\nauthorization, and dynamic mobility security
    association allocation,\ne.g.  MN-HA SA allocation.  Some SDOs are considering
    the use of\nDiameter Mobile IPv4 Application to replace RADIUS based mechanism.\nHowever,
    these SDos use a link layer access authentication mechanism,\ne.g., using an EAP
    application, to derive the related MIP4 shared\nkeys and security association.
    \ This document an overview of these\nrespected architectures and their handling
    to MIP4 security\nassociation and keys derivation and distribution.  It presents
    an\nanalysis of the performance and impact of Diameter MIPv4 Application\nand
    RADIUS based solutions on the time the mobile node uses during\nthe initial session
    setup.  Some common MIPv4 scenarios which require\nthe mobile node to retransmit
    its initial RRQ message have been\nidentified and used.  The set of assumptions
    and requirements used\nfor this study has been clearly documented under section
    5.\n\t </p>\n      "
