abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI) using vendor installed X.509 certificate, in combination
    with a vendor's authorizing service, both online and offline. Bootstrapping a
    new device can occur using a routable address and a cloud service, or using only
    link-local connectivity, or on limited/disconnected networks. Support for lower
    security models, including devices with minimal identity, is described for legacy
    reasons but not encouraged. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity
    of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device but the established
    secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device
    as well.</p>"
