abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,
    delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic engineering
    (TE). This data provides operators the characteristics of their networks for performance
    evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Performance
    measurement mechanisms can be employed to measure these metrics for TE LSPs in
    real-time. This document describes PCEP extensions for reporting such performance
    measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.</p>"
