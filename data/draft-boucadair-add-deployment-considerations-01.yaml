abstract:
- content: "<p>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various
    options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS,
    or DNS-over-QUIC). Particularly, this document is meant to exemplify how Discovery
    of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR)
    can be used in typical deployment contexts. Also, the document includes considerations
    related to hosting a DNS forwarder in local networks.</p>"
