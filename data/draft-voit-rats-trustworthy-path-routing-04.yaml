abstract:
- content: "<p>There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like IPSec
    alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly sensitive
    traffic flows. These end-users want their flows to traverse devices which have
    been freshly appraised and verified for trustworthiness. This specification describes
    Trusted Path Routing. Trusted Path Routing protects sensitive flows as they transit
    a network by forwarding traffic to/from sensitive subnets across network devices
    recently appraised as trustworthy.</p>"
