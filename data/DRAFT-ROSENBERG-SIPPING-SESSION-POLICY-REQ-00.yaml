abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The proxy server plays a central role as an intermediary in the\nestablishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\nIn that role, they can
    define and impact policies on call routing,\nrendezvous, and other call features.
    \ However, there is no standard\nmeans by which proxies can have any influence
    on session policies,\nsuch as the codecs that are to be used.  As such, ad-hoc
    and\nnon-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for such policy\nmechanisms.
    \ There is a need for a standards-based and complete\nmechanism for session policies.
    \ This document defines a set of\nrequirements for such a mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n
