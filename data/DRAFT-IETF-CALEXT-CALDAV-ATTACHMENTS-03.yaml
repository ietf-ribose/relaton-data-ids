abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines an extension to the calendar access\n
    \  protocol (CalDAV) to allow attachments associated with iCalendar data\n   to
    be stored and managed on the server.\n\n   This specification documents existing
    code deployed by multiple\n   vendors.  It is published as an Informational specification
    rather\n   than Standards-Track due to its non-standard method of updating an\n
    \  existing resource via HTTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
