abstract:
- content: "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet user behavior, particularly
    during the introduction of the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.
    These behavior changes drove changes in Internet traffic. The Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss network impacts of the pandemic on November
    9-13, 2020. The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network operators,
    network management experts, and Internet technologists to share their experiences.
    The meeting was held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions
    at that time.</p>"
