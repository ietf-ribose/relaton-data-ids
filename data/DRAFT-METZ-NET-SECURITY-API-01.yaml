abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This  API  is  a  means for sockets applications to request
    network\n   security services from an operating system. It is  designed  to  move\n
    \  most  of the work and intelligence of security policy processing into\n   the
    operating system so that the burden  on  application  authors  is\n   light enough
    to encourage the use of network security.\n \n     It  is  documented  here  for
    \ the benefit of others who might also\n   adopt and use  the  API,  thus  providing
    \ increased  portability  of\n   applications  that  use  network  security  services
    \ (e.g.,  the  IP\n   Security ESP and AH protocols).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
