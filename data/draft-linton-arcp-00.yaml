abstract:
  content: "<p>Automatic Router Configuration Protocol is a method by which Routersmay
    be automatically configured according to a predefined or defaultscheme of behavior
    and address allocation. It is routing protocolindependent and is based on on a
    Client-Server model, working inconjunction with DHCP [2] and using a system of
    IP messages forcommunication between participating Router Clients and Servers.
    It iseasy to use as a labor-saving device in less secure environments andwill
    work even in conjunction with unmodified DHCP Serverimplementations. However,
    it also has inherent security features andis capable of highly secure implementation.</p>"
