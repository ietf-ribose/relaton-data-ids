abstract:
- content: "<p>Automatic Router Configuration Protocol is a method by which Routers
    may be automatically configured according to a predefined or default scheme of
    behavior and address allocation. It is routing protocol independent and is based
    on on a Client-Server model, working in conjunction with DHCP [2] and using a
    system of IP messages for communication between participating Router Clients and
    Servers. It is easy to use as a labor-saving device in less secure environments
    and will work even in conjunction with unmodified DHCP Server implementations.
    However, it also has inherent security features and is capable of highly secure
    implementation.</p>"
