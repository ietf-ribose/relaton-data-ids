abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n
    \  virtual network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated\n   by
    the application of network abstraction. These abstractions shall\n   create a
    virtual network operation environment supporting mobile\n   operators in viewing,
    managing and operating multi-domains of many\n   dimensions (e.g., radio access,
    backhaul transport, mobile DC edge,\n   mobile DC core, packet/optical transport
    for DC interconnect, etc.)\n   as a single virtualized network.\n\n   This use-case
    considers the application of these abstractions and\n   the need for the associated
    operational mechanisms within the\n   network of a single operator.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
