abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) is to deliver\n
    \  content to end users in an efficient manner from the perspective of\n   the
    network providers and with consistently good performance from\n   the perspective
    of the end user. Due to footprint limitations of a\n   single network provider,
    it may be necessary to interconnect CDNs\n   between different providers. The
    Content Distribution Network\n   Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been
    chartered to develop\n   an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.\n\n
    \  The requirements for CDN interconnection are being discussed and\n   developed
    in various industry forums. One example is the Alliance\n   for Telecommunications
    Industry Solutions (ATIS) Cloud Services\n   Forum (CSF) which is looking at CDN
    interconnection requirements\n   from the perspective of telecom providers. This
    document introduces\n   some additional requirements to be included in the CDNI
    working\n   group based on conclusions reached by ATIS CSF. The goal is for\n
    \  specifications developed by CDNI to successfully support some of the\n   needs
    expressed by ATIS CSF as interpreted by the authors of this\n   document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
