abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes IAX, the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, an
    application-layer control and media protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating
    multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IAX was developed by
    the open source community for the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is
    targeted primarily at Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it
    can be used with streaming video or any other type of multimedia. IAX is an "all
    in one" protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks. It combines both control
    and media services in the same protocol. In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data
    stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT)
    gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT,
    and simplifying network and firewall management. IAX employs a compact encoding
    that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service.
    In addition, its open nature permits new payload type additions needed to support
    additional services. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>
