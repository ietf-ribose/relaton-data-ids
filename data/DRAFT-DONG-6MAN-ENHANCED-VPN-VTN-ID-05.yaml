abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which
    has a\n   customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network\n
    \  resources allocated from the physical network.  A VTN can be used as\n   the
    underlay for one or a group of overlay VPNs to provide enhanced\n   VPN (VPN+)
    services.  In packet forwarding, some fields in the data\n   packet needs to be
    used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so\n   that the VTN-specific processing
    can be performed on each node the\n   packet traverses.\n\n   This document proposes
    a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension\n   header to carry the VTN Resource
    ID, which is used to identify the\n   set of network resources allocated to a
    VTN for packet processing.\n   The procedure for processing the VTN option is
    also specified.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
