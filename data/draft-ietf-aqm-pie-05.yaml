abstract:
- content: "<p>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network cause
    high latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications (e.g. voice
    over IP, real time video streaming and financial transactions) run in the Internet,
    high latency and jitter degrade application performance. There is a pressing need
    to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and jitter;
    and hence provide desirable quality of service to users. This document presents
    a lightweight active queue management design, called PIE (Proportional Integral
    controller Enhanced), that can effectively control the average queueing latency
    to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis and Linux testbed
    results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization
    under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamp,
    so it incurs very small overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware
    and software.</p>"
