abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts on a
    server using JMAP. Open Issues o Should we introduce an "isIncluded" or "isInUse"
    filter/sort condition for the /query method to locate scripts which are included
    by others? o Do we need any (rate) limits for /test? o Should ":fcc" and associated
    arguments (e.g., ":flags", ":create":, etc) reported in the /test response be
    in their own "fcc" sub-object rather than listed inline with the rest of the arguments
    for the action?</p>
