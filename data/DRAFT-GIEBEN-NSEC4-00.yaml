abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced
    the\n   NSEC resource record for authenticated denial of existence, and the\n
    \  NSEC3 resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.\n   This
    document introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which\n   similarly
    provides authenticated denial of existence.  It permits\n   gradual expansion
    of delegation-centric zones, just like NSEC3 does.\n   With NSEC4 it is possible,
    but not required, to provide measures\n   against zone enumeration.\n\n   NSEC4
    reduces the size of the denial of existence response and adds\n   Opt-Out to unhashed
    names.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
