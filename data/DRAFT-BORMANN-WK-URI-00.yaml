abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, \"/.well-known/\", that can
    be used by\n   well-known URIs, specifically for the \"http\" and \"https\" URI
    schemes,\n   which has since been adopted by other URI schemes.  The present memo\n
    \  formally updates RFC 7595, which defines the URI schemes regustry, to\n   record
    the availability of these well-known URIs to the URI schemes\n   registered there.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
