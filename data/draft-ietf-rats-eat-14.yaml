abstract:
- content: "<p>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides an attested claims set that
    describes state and characteristics of an entity, a device like a phone, IoT device,
    network equipment or such. This claims set is used by a relying party, server
    or service to determine how much it wishes to trust the entity. An EAT is either
    a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented claims.
    To a large degree, all this document does is extend CWT and JWT.</p>"
