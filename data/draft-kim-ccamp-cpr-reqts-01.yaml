abstract:
- content: "<p>The resilience of control plane refers to the ability of control plane
    to continue its operation even under failure conditions of control components
    such as control entities, control nodes, and control channels. This document describes
    requirements for providing the resilience capability of control plane (in other
    words, control network) in non-(G)MPLS and (G)MPLS. This contribution, as a document
    that proposes a framework to provide the resilience capability of control plane,
    include terminologies, basic concepts of control networks, possible configurations,
    necessities and requirements, additional considerations including the relationship
    with other protocol such as LMP for the resilience of control plane.</p>"
