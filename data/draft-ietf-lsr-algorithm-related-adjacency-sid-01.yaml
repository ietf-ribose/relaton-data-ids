abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing algorithms,
    i.e, different constraint-based shortest-path calculations can be supported. There
    are two standard algorithms: SPF and Strict-SPF, defined in Segment Routing architecture.
    There are also other user defined algorithms according to Flex-algo applicaiton.
    However, an algorithm identifier is often included as part of a Prefix-SID advertisement,
    that maybe not satisfy some scenarios where multiple algorithm share the same
    link resource. This document complement that the algorithm identifier can be also
    included as part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement</p>"
