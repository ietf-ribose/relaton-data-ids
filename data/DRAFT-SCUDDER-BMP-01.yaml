abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be used
    to\nmonitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a more convenient\ninterface
    for obtaining route views for research purpose than the\nscreen-scraping approach
    in common use today.  The design goals are\nto keep BMP simple, useful, easily
    implemented, and minimally\nservice-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as
    a routing\nprotocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
