abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies how Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can beutilized
    in Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP)networks. Peers in a P2PSIP
    network need to have long-livedconnections to other peers in the network, and
    HIP can be utilized tosetup and maintain those connections. HIP is a good choice
    forconnection maintenance, because it provides functionalities likeNetwork Address
    Translation (NAT) traversal, mobility, multi-homing,and enhanced security properties.</p>"
