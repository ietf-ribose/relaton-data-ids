abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5512 defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the \"Tunnel\n
    \  Encapsulation Attribute\".  This attribute allows one to specify a set\n   of
    tunnels.  For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide\n   additional information
    used to create a tunnel and the corresponding\n   encapsulation header, and can
    also provide information that aids in\n   choosing whether a particular packet
    is to be sent through a\n   particular tunnel.  RFC 5512 states that the attribute
    is only\n   carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the \"Encapsulation Subsequent\n
    \  Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)\".  This document updates RFC 5512\n   by
    deprecating the Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used),and\n   by specifying
    semantics for the attribute when it is carried in\n   UPDATEs of certain other
    SAFIs.  This document also extends the\n   attribute by enabling it to carry additional
    information needed to\n   create the encapsulation headers additional tunnel types
    not\n   mentioned in RFC 5512.  Finally, this document also extends the\n   attribute
    by allowing it to specify a remote tunnel endpoint address\n   for each tunnel.\n\n\t
