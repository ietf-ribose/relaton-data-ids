abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Both WebDAV servers and clients frequently map URI-escaped
    characters\n   inside a path segment to non-ASCII characters.  These mappings
    can\n   only be interoperable if there is a consensus about the appropriate\n
    \  character encoding.  This document specifies a default encoding that\n   is
    compatible with both the recommendations for URIs in HTML content\n   and the
    \"Internationalized Resource Identifiers\" (IRI) specification.\n\n   Furthermore,
    servers that implement a mapping to locally constrained\n   names frequently do
    not support specific names, or silently map\n   \"similar\" names to the same
    resource (for instance when content is\n   stored in a filesystem that is case-preserving,
    but not case-\n   sensitive).  For these cases, discovery and error signalling
    features\n   are defined.\n\t </p>\n      "
