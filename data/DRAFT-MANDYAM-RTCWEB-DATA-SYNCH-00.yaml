abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RTCWeb working group in the IETF is tasked with developing
    \nstandards that will ensure interoperability between web browsers \nestablishing
    rich communications sessions. This working group is \ntasked with delivering the
    specifications necessary to establish \nreal-time transport sessions between browsers
    (e.g. those based on \nreal-time protocol, i.e. RTP). Moreover, the group is also
    tasked \nwith providing a means for application data streaming between \nbrowsers
    (i.e. opaque data streaming). Much like RTP \nsynchronization sources (SSRC's)
    can be temporally synchronized, \nthere are use cases that require opaque data
    stream synchronization \nwith the real-time communications stream between browsers
    in an \nRTCWeb session. This document provides some options for temporally \nassociating
    an opaque data stream with a voice/video stream as part \nof RTCWeb communications.
