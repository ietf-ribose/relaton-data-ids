abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to
    deliver a\n   Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.  These services include\n
    \  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN service\n   (VPLS).
    \ This model is intended to be instantiated at management\n   system to deliver
    the L2VPN service, and is not a configuration model\n   to be used directly on
    network elements.\n\n   This model provides an abstracted view of the Layer 2
    VPN service\n   configuration components.  It will be up to a management\n   system(orchestrator)
    to take this as an input and use specific\n   configurations models to configure
    the different network elements to\n   deliver the service.  It is called as north
    bound L2VPN Service YANG\n   data model.  How configuration of network elements
    is out of scope of\n   the document, and is defined in document[I-D.shah-bess-l2vpn-yang].\n\n\t
