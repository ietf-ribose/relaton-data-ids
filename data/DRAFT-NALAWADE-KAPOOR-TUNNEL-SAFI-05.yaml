abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is a growing requirement for network operators to support\nmulti-address
    familiy routing and forwarding services across their\nbackbone networks. In general
    this is accomplished by constructing a\nmesh of tunnels between the backbbone
    provider edge routers and then\nadvertising reachability to prefixes through specific
    tunnels. This\ndocument defines a new subsequence address family identifier\nassociated
    with a tunnel end-point information. This enables a single\negress provider edge
    router to use the border gateway protocol as a\nscalable and efficient means to
    distribute its tunnel end-point\ninformation to many ingress provider edge routers.
    The result is that\nthe mesh of tunnels is in place and packets can be forwarded
    through\nthese tunnels based on advertised reachability.\n\t </p>\n      "
