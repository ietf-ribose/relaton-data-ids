abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension to DNS Over HTTPS (DoH)
    that\n   allows hiding client IP addresses via proxying encrypted DNS\n   transactions.
    \ This improves privacy of DNS operations by not\n   allowing any one server entity
    to be aware of both the client IP\n   address and the content of DNS queries and
    answers.\n\n   This experimental extension is developed outside the IETF and is\n
    \  published here to guide implementation, ensure interoperability among\n   implementations,
    and enable wide-scale experimentation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
