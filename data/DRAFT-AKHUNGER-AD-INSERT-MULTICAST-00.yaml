abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Providing a Standard method for Addition of regional Advertisements\n
    \  in the IP Multicast Video Streaming is very important , because the\n   equipment
    deployed would most likely be from different vendors across\n   a multicast network.\n\n
    \  The idea is to introduce a special kind of Enhanced IGMP Ad-Insert\n   control
    packet, which is passed from the multicast source to\n   intermediate routers
    and which indicates that the source is going to\n   stop sending multicast traffic
    for a particular group for specified\n   time and the Regional center can utilize
    this time to insert its\n   regional advertisement.\n\t </p>\n      "
