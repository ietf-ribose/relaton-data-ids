abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines YANG modules to add support for classifying\n
    \  traffic received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to\n   sub-interfaces
    based on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN\n   frame headers.  These modules
    allow IETF forwarding protocols (such\n   as IPv6 and VPLS) to interoperate with
    VLAN tagged traffic orginated\n   from an IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridge.  Primarily
    the classification\n   is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but
    the model\n   also has support for matching on some other layer 2 frame header\n
    \  fields and is designed to be extensible to match on other arbitrary\n   header
    fields.\n\n   The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the\n
    \  configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being\n   based
    on membership of an 802.1Q VLAN bridge.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
