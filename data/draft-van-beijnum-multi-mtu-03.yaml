abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the early days of the internet, many different link types withmany
    different maximum packet sizes were in use. For point-to-pointor point-to-multipoint
    links, there are still some other link types(PPP, ATM, Packet over SONET), but
    multipoint subnets are now almostexclusively implemented as ethernets. Even though
    the relevantstandards mandate a 1500 byte maximum packet size for ethernet, moreand
    more ethernet equipment is capable of handling packets biggerthan 1500 bytes.
    However, since this capability isn't standardized,it is seldom used today, despite
    the potential performance benefitsof using larger packets. This document specifies
    mechanisms tonegotiate per-neighbor maximum packet sizes so that nodes on amultipoint
    subnet may use the maximum mutually supported packet sizebetween them without
    being limited by nodes with smaller maximumsizes on the same subnet.</p>"
