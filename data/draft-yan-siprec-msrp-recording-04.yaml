abstract:
- content: "<p>SIPREC is capable of recording interactive text media that is transmitted
    via RTP. However that format is not commonly used for message or chat scenarios.
    There is also a need for recording text media carried via MSRP. One case of note
    is exchange of text between hearing-impaired users and emergence service bureaus.
    Also, recording support is needed for MSRP used in chat conferences and multimedia
    conferences. This document describes how to achieve MSRP channel recording within
    the mechanism of SIP Recording (SIPREC).</p>"
