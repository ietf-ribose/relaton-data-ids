abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based
    on\n   multi-dimensional criteria.  Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO,\n
    \  may be used by a downstream CDN to expose content routing information\n   and
    interconnection preferences to an upstream CDN.  The selection of\n   such a protocol
    is premature as the WG, and especially the Footprint/\n   Capabilities Design
    Team, is currently working on this topic.  So\n   this draft does not promote
    the usage of the ALTO protocol for CDN\n   interconnection.  It presents the limitations
    of the current ALTO\n   protocol in the case it would be selected for CDN interconnection.\n
    \  It specifies the mechanism for controlling the session initialization\n   and
    for limiting the information exchanged.  Then it discusses the\n   need of incremental
    update and proposes to study the usage of\n   Netconf/Yang to provide ALTO server
    with notifications.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
