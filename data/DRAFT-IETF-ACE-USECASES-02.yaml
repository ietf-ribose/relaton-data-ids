abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained devices are nodes with limited processing power,
    storage\n   space and transmission capacities.  These devices in many cases do\n
    \  not provide user interfaces and are often intended to interact\n   without
    human intervention.\n\n   This document comprises a collection of representative
    use cases for\n   the application of authentication and authorization in constrained\n
    \  environments.  These use cases aim at identifying authorization\n   problems
    that arise during the lifecylce of a constrained device and\n   are intended to
    provide a guideline for developing a comprehensive\n   authentication and access
    control solution for this class of\n   scenarios.\n\n   Where specific details
    are relevant, it is assumed that the devices\n   use the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) as communication\n   protocol, however most conclusions apply
    generally.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
