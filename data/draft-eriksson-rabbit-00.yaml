abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document identifies and categorizes the components of routing,switching,
    forwarding, and addressing that may be used in routingarchitectures. The intention
    is to support the development of a newrouting architecture for the Internet.The
    addressing architecture, address allocation and assignmentprinciples, and possibilities
    for renumbering are important aspectswhen designing a routing architecture. How
    routing information islearned and methods for distributing it are other issues
    discussed inthis document. A number of methods for data traffic forwarding arealso
    described and evaluated</p>"
