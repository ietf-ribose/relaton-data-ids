abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports and discusses issues in DNS root services, based
    on experiences from the experiments in the Yeti DNS project. These issues include
    IPv6-only operation, the root DNS server naming scheme, DNSSEC KSK rollover, root
    server renumbering, multiple root zone signer, and so on. This project was founded
    in May 2015 and has since built a live root DNS server system testbed with volunteer
    root server and resolver operations.</p>"
