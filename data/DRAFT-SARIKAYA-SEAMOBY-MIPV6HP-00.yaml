abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical
    Paging\n(HMIPv6HP), an IP host alerting protocol which is an extension to\nHierarchical
    Mobile IPv6. The extension allows a mobile node to enter\na power saving dormant
    mode during which its location is known with\ncoarse accuracy defined by a paging
    area. In the visited domain only\nthe paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is responsible
    for keeping\nthe binding cache entries for dormant mobile nodes and, it re-\nestablishes
    the downlink routes on demand by means of paging. Paging\nis initiated by the
    paging agent (PA) and the access routers in\npaging areas and does not involve
    periodic layer 3 messages to be\nsent except for time-slot based paging which
    is optional and is to be\nused on links with no support for layer 2 paging. The
    protocol works\nwith layer 2 paging areas if they are supported.\n\t </p>\n      "
