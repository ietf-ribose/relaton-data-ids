abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a general purpose message framing named
    WiSH\n   which supports bi-directional message-based communication over byte-\n
    \  stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics).\n   The
    WiSH framing is designed to be compatible with WebSocket.  You\n   may want to
    think about WiSH as a binary and bi-directional\n   alternative to the framing
    defined for the server-sent events [SSE].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
