abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IESG returned the MIP v6 draft to the working group due to\nconcerns
    about the security and scalability of binding updates and\nthe associated IPSEC
    processing that is specified in the draft.\nSince that time discussions have continued
    to attempt to define what\nis really needed to make binding updates secure.  In
    the course of\ndiscussing the requirements it became apparent that a threat model
    is\nneeded in order to adequately specify the security requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n
