abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers
    and\n   user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to\n
    \  a particular mailing list.  With the advent of list header fields, it\n   has
    become even more important to provide a unique identifier for a\n   mailing list
    regardless of the particular host that runs the mailing\n   list manager at any
    given time.\n\n   The List-Id header field provides a standard location for such
    an\n   identifier.  In addition, a namespace for mailing list identifiers\n   based
    on fully qualified domain names is described.  This namespace\n   is intended
    to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require it,\n   while allowing for
    a less rigorous namespace for experimental and\n   personal use.\n\n   By including
    the List-Id field, mailing list managers can make it\n   easier for mail user
    agents to provide automated tools for users to\n   perform mailing list functions.
    \ The mailing list identifier can\n   serve as a key for automated processing
    tasks\n\n\t </p>\n      "
