abstract:
- content: "<p>Collecting large amounts of data from network infrastructure devices
    has never been very easy. Existing methods generate CPU and memory loads that
    may be unacceptable, the output varies across implementations and can be difficult
    to parse, and these methods are often difficult to scale. I2RS programmatic interfacing
    with the routing system may exacerbate this problem: state needs to be collected
    from nodes and fed to consumers participating in the control plane that may not
    be physically close to the nodes. This state includes not only control plane information,
    but elements of the data plane that have a direct impact on control plane behavior,
    like traffic engineering. This document outlines a set of use cases requiring
    a flexible framework to collect routing system data, and the features and functionality
    needed to make such a framework useful for these use cases.</p>"
