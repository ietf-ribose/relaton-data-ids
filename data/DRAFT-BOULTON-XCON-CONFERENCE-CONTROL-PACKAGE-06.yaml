abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Centralized Conferencing framework defines a model whereby
    client\n   initiated interactions are required for creation, deletion,\n   manipulation
    and querying the state of a of conference.  This\n   document defines a Media
    Control Channel Package for XCON client\n   initiated Conference Control.  The
    Package is based on the Media\n   Control Channel Framework, which is also used
    for media server\n   control, thus optimizing the implementation for some entities\n
    \  participating in an XCON system.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
