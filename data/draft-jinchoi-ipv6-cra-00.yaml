abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the Router Advertisement issues for Movement Detection/
    Detection of Network Attachment. Based on [RFC-2461], the information contained
    in RA is inadequate for efficient Movement Detection due to inconsistency and
    incompleteness. This draft describes the problems concerning Movement Detection
    and investigates the possible solutions.</p>"
