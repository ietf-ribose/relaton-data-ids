abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Registration Protocol for DNS-Based Service Discovery uses
    the standard DNS Update mechanism to enable DNS-Based Service Discovery using
    only unicast packets. This makes it possible to deploy DNS Service Discovery without
    multicast, which greatly improves scalability and improves performance on networks
    where multicast service is not an optimal choice, particularly 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
    and 802.15.4 (IoT) networks. DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and
    SIG(0) to allow services to defend their registrations against attack.</p>"
