abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Secure DHCPv6 includes mechanisms for encryption and authentication,\n
    \  where encryption is currently mandated due to concerns for pervasive\n   monitoring
    in the Internet.  The Secure DHCPv6 specification states\n   that the mechanisms
    are applicable in any environment where physical\n   security on the link is not
    assured and attacks on DHCPv6 are a\n   concern.  However, this document presents
    a reference use case where\n   physical and/or link-layer security are already
    assured.  This\n   document therefore proposes an authentication-only application
    of\n   Secure DHCPv6 when there is already sufficent protection against\n   pervasive
    monitoirng.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
