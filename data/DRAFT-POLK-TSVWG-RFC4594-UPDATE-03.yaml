abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ
    and\n   identifies how they are used and how to construct them using \n   Differentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, \n   Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs),
    and Active Queue Management (AQM) \n   mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement
    that particular \n   DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a
    certain \n   service class, but for consistent behavior under the same network
    \n   conditions, configuring networks as described here is appropriate. \n\n\n\t
