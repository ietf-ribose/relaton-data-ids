abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys
    (PSKs) in TLS. It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain
    assumptions and demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks.
    This document also discusses PSK use cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack
    implementation support in the context of these assumptions. It provides advice
    for applications in various use cases to help meet these assumptions.</p>"
