abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims at analyzing the various design options
    and\n   providing a set of recommendations for the design of Service Function\n
    \  Chaining solution(s).  Note:\n\n   o  The analysis does not claim to be exhaustive.
    \ The list includes a\n      preliminary set of potential solutions; other proposals
    can be\n      added to the analysis if required.\n\n   o  The analysis is still
    ongoing.  The analysis text will be updated\n      to integrate received comments
    and inputs.\n\n   o  Sketched recommendations are not frozen.  These recommendations\n
    \     are provided as proposals to kick-off the discussion and to\n      challenge
    them.\n\n   o  The analysis does not cover any application-specific solution\n
    \     (e.g., HTTP header) because of the potential issues inherent to\n      (TLS)
    encrypted traffic.\n\n   o  The analysis will be updated to take into account
    the full set of\n      SFC requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
