abstract:
  content: <p>In the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection (or interworking),several
    solutions have been proposed within IETF. Some of thesesolutions require the definition
    of a new IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresswhich is used to represent an IPv4-only host
    in an IPv6 realms andthe definition of a new mechanism called DNS64 for synthesizing
    aAAAA record, representing an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address in the DNSsystem, from
    the A record representing the IPv4 address of the IPv4-only host . This IPv4-Embedded
    IPv6 address, when managed by atranslator, is to be considered as "fake" address
    in a DNS systemsince it is not necessarily assigned to any host's interfacequalified
    by the associated name.This document defines a new DNS record type and query type
    toidentify IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address from native IPv6 ones. The newrecord type
    and query type aim at helping the requesting party toenforce its policies and
    avoid crossing NAT64 boxes when possible.Native addresses are to be preferred.</p>
