abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-\n
    \  level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information\n   systems.
    \ This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests,\n   including metadata
    header fields for indicating state changes,\n   request header fields for making
    preconditions on such state, and\n   rules for constructing the responses to a
    conditional request when\n   one or more preconditions evaluate to false.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 7232.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
