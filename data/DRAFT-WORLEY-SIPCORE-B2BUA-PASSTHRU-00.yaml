abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Some SIP architectures use \"application servers\", B2BUAs that
    are\ninserted between two user agents during a conversation, to provide\nadditional
    processing.  Since B2BUAs do not follow the rules for SIP\nproxies, they do not
    by default interoperate with SIP call control\noperations.  Augmenting application
    servers with suitable behaviors\nfor handling SIP call control operations mitigates
    these problems,\nand in many cases, allows standard user agents to use SIP call\ncontrol
    features without modification.\n\t </p>\n      "
