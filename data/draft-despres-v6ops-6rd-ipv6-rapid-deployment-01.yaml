abstract:
  content: <p>IPv6 rapid deployment (6rd) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 (RFC3056)to
    enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast serviceto its existing
    IPv4 sites. Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 inIPv4 encapsulation in order
    to transit IPv4-only networkinfrastructure. Unlike 6to4, 6rd requires a service
    provider to useone of its own IP prefixes rather than the fixed 6to4 prefix. Aservice
    provider has used this mechanism for its own "rapiddeployment" of IPv6 (five weeks
    from first exposure to "opt-in"deployment for 1,500,000 residential sites).</p>
