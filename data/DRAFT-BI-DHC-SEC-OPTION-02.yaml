abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP
    servers\n   to provision with DHCP clients specific security configuration\n   information.
    It has been known that DHCP protocol typically works at\n   the very beginning
    stage of the access to networks, thus lack of\n   security protection. However,
    although it is difficult to set up some\n   security mechanism for DHCP protocol
    solely, it is able to play a key\n   role for DHCP server to provide configuration
    information to help\n   building security mechanism within those pre-configured
    DHCP clients\n   and devices. This new option defines a simple extension to current\n
    \  standard format and benefits to those who need to activate security\n   mechanism
    in an early stage and interoperate within devices from\n   multiple vendors.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
