abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for
    the\n   Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange.\n   This
    document has three goals.  First, increase the security of\n   Kerberos pre-authentication
    exchanges by making offline brute-force\n   attacks infeasible.  Second, enable
    the use of secure second factor\n   authentication without relying on FAST.  This
    is achived using the\n   existing trust relationship established by the shared
    first factor.\n   Third, make Kerberos pre-authentication more resilient against
    time\n   synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted\n
    \  timestamp from the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
