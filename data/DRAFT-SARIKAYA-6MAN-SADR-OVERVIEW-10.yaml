abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents the source address dependent routing
    (SADR)\n   problem space from the host perspective.  Both multihomed hosts and\n
    \  hosts with multiple interfaces are considered.  Several network\n   architectures
    are presented to illustrate why source address\n   selection and next hop resolution
    in view of source address dependent\n   routing is needed.\n\n   The document
    is scoped on identifying a set of scenarios for source\n   address dependent routing
    from the host perspective and analyze a set\n   of solutions to mitigate encountered
    issues.  The document does not\n   make any solution recommendations.\n\n\t </p>\n
