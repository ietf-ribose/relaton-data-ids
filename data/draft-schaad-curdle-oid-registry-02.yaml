abstract:
- content: "<p>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object
    identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for the purpose of registering
    the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature algorithms. This donated
    set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than would be possible using the existing
    S/MIME or PKIX arcs. This document describes the range of identifiers that were
    assigned in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes
    IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.</p>"
