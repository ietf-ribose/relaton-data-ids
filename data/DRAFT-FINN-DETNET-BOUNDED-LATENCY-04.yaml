abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a timing model for Deterministic Networking\n
    \  (DetNet), so that existing and future standards can achieve the\n   DetNet
    quality of service features of bounded latency and zero\n   congestion loss.  It
    defines requirements for resource reservation\n   protocols or servers.  It calls
    out queuing mechanisms, defined in\n   other documents, that can provide the DetNet
    quality of service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
