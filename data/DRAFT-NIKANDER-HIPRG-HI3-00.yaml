abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Secure Internet Indirection Infrastructure (Secure-i3)
    is a\n   proposal for a flexible and secure overlay network that, if\n   universally
    deployed, would effectively block a number of\n   denial-of-service problems in
    the Internet.  The Host Identity\n   Protocol (HIP), on the other hand, is a proposal
    for deploying\n   opportunistic, IPsec based end-to-end security, allowing any
    hosts to\n   communicate in a secure way through the Internet.  In this paper,
    we\n   explore various possibilities for combining ideas from Secure-i3 and\n
    \  HIP, thereby producing an architecture that is more efficient and\n   secure
    than Secure-i3 and more flexible and denial-of-service\n   resistant than HIP.\n\t
