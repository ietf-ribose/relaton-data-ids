abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification introduces a symmetric cryptography mechanism
    forprotecting signaling messages between the Mobile Node and previousAccess Router
    for Fast Mobile IPv6. The method defined here utilizesthe Master Session Key(MSK)
    generated from EAP authentication toderive a fast handover key between the Mobile
    Node and the AccessRouter in order to avoid certain attacks. This mechanism also
    adoptsthe Mobile Node Identifier option and the mobility messageauthentication
    option to the FMIPv6 signaling messages.</p>"
