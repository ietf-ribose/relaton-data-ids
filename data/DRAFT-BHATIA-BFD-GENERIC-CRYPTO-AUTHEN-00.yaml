abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding\n
    \  Detection (BFD) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication\n   algorithm
    in addition to the already-documented authentication\n   schemes described in
    the base specification.  This document adds the\n   basic infrastructure thats
    required for supporting algorithm and key\n   agility for BFD.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
