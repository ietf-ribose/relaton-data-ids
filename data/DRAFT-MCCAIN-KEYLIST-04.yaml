abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client
    may\n   subscribe to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore\n   up-to-date
    with correct keys, even in cases where the keys correspond\n   to multiple (potentially
    uncontrolled) domains.  Ensuring that all\n   members or followers of an organization
    have their colleagues' most\n   recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining
    operational\n   security.  Without the most recent keys' fingerprints and a source
    of\n   trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users must\n   manually
    update and sign each others' keys -- a system that is\n   untenable in larger
    organizations.  This document proposes a\n   experimental format for the keylist
    file as well as requirements for\n   clients who wish to implement this experimental
    keylist subscription\n   functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
