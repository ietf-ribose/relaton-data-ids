abstract:
- content: "<p>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance monitoring in IP networks.
    Delay measurement is performed in these protocols by using timestamped test packets.
    Some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the
    accurate transmission timestamp into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet during
    transmission. Since these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP checksum field
    is then updated to reflect this modification. This document proposes to use the
    last 2 octets of every test packet as a Checksum Trailer, allowing timestamping
    engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather than
    in the UDP checksum field. The behavior defined in this document is completely
    interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.</p>"
