abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the Kerberos
    protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This document has three
    goals. First, increase the security of Kerberos pre-authentication exchanges by
    making offline brute-force attacks infeasible. Second, enable the use of secure
    second factor authentication without relying on FAST. This is achived using the
    existing trust relationship established by the shared first factor. Third, make
    Kerberos pre-authentication more resilient against time synchronization errors
    by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp from the client.</p>"
