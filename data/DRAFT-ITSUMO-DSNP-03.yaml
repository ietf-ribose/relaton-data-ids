abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents the specification of Dynamic Service Negotiation\n
    \  Protocol (DSNP).  DSNP is a  protocol to negotiate the SLS (Service\n   Level
    \ Specification) in  IP layer.   It  can be  used for  service\n   negotiation
    from host  to network, network to host,  and network to\n   network.   The  automated
    \ negotiation  makes  service  negotiation\n   efficient in terms of time, cost,
    and correctness, etc. The dynamic\n   negotiation not only allows users to adapt
    their needs dynamically,\n   but  also  let providers  better  utilize  the  network.
    \ The  DSNP\n   messages and packet formats are  detailed. DSNP can be used in
    both\n   wireline  and  wireless  networks.   It is,  however,  particularly\n
    \  useful  in mobile  environment.  To  demonstrate the  usefulness of\n   DSNP,
    \  a  reference  wireless   QoS  architecture   is  presented.\n   Exemplary applications
    are illustrated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
