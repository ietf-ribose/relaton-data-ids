abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise\nmultiple
    distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a\nnumber of potential
    benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster\nconvergence and better loadsharing.\n\nThis
    document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths\nso that network
    operators have the tools needed to address their\nspecific applications and to
    manage the scalability impact of Add-\nPaths. A router implementing Add-Paths
    may learn many paths for a\nprefix and must decide which of these to advertise
    to peers. This\ndocument analyses different algorithms for making this selection
    and\nprovides recommendations based on the target application.\n\t </p>\n      "
