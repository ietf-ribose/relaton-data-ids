abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels provide the ability to use a
    shared\n   MPLS forwarding plane at every hop of the Label Switched Path (LSP).\n
    \  The shared forwarding plane is realized with the use of 'Traffic\n   Engineering
    (TE) link labels' that get shared by LSPs traversing\n   these TE links.  This
    paradigm helps significantly reduce the\n   forwarding plane state required to
    support a large number of LSPs on\n   a Label Switching Router (LSR).  These tunnels
    require the ingress\n   Label Edge Router (LER) to impose a stack of labels.  If
    the ingress\n   LER cannot impose the full label stack, it can use the assistance
    of\n   one or more delegation hops along the path of the LSP to impose parts\n
    \  of the label stack.\n\n   The procedures for a Point of Local Repair (PLR)
    to provide local\n   protection against link failures using facility backup for
    Segment\n   Routed RSVP-TE tunnels are well defined and do not require specific\n
    \  protocol extensions.  This document defines the procedures for a PLR\n   to
    provide local protection against transit node failures using\n   facility backup
    for these tunnels.  The procedures defined in this\n   document include protection
    against delegation hop failures.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
