abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG). It conforms to the directions found in the NWCRG taxonomy
    (RFC 8406). The objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of Network Coding
    techniques in and above the network layer in satellite communication systems.
    This document also identifies open research issues related to the deployment of
    Network Coding in satellite communication systems.</p>"
