abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a real-time communication session, there may be a need or\n
    \  preference for receiving the same content in two or more simultaneous\n   modalities.
    \ This specification extends a mechanism for human\n   language negotiation with
    a mechanism for indication of preference\n   for, or the availability of, simultaneously
    provided transformations\n   of original contents.  This indication enables negotiation
    of\n   simultaneous modalities in real-time sessions.  Applications are for\n
    \  example provision of both spoken and written content in a real-time\n   call
    (captioning), or provision of both spoken language original and\n   sign language
    interpretation of the original language in a real-time\n   session.\n\n\t </p>\n
