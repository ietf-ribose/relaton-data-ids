abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification for how a client discovers its network's
    NAT64\n   prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this\n
    \  purpose, but declares it to be a non-special name in that\n   specification's
    Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.\n\n   Consequently, despite the
    well articulated special purpose of the\n   name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded
    in the Special-Use Domain\n   Names registry as a name with special properties.\n\n
    \  As a result of this omission, in cases where software needs to give\n   this
    name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there\n   was no clear
    mandate authorizing software authors to implement that\n   special treatment.
    \ Software implementers were left with the choice\n   between not implementing
    the special behavior necessary for the name\n   queries to work correctly, or
    implementing the special behavior and\n   being accused of being noncompliant
    with some RFC.\n\n   This document formally declares the actual special properties
    of the\n   name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse\n
    \  mapping names.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
