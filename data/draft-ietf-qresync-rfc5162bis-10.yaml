abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes
    to a common IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients working on behalf
    of the same user and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients
    need a mechanism to efficiently synchronize state changes for messages within
    the mailbox. Initially defined in RFC 4551, the Conditional Store facility provides
    a protected update mechanism for message state information and a mechanism for
    requesting only changes to the message state. This memo updates that mechanism
    and obsoletes RFC 4551, based on operational experience. This document additionally
    updates another IMAP extension, Quick Resynchronization, which builds on the Conditional
    STORE extension to provide an IMAP client the ability to fully resynchronize a
    mailbox as part of the SELECT/EXAMINE command, without the need for additional
    server-side state or client round trips. Hence, this memo obsoletes RFC 5162.
    Finally, this document also updates the line-length recommendation in Section
    3.2.1.5 of RFC 2683.</p>"
