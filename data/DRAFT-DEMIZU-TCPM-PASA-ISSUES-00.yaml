abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a method of protecting TCP connections
    against\n   off-path, third party spoofing attacks, by making use of the TCP\n
    \  Timestamps option specified in RFC1323.\n\n   The original basis of the idea
    was proposed by Kacheong Poon.  This\n   memo discusses its issues to add complementary
    ideas to his original\n   approach.  Viable ideas in this memo will be incorporated
    into his\n   upcoming draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
