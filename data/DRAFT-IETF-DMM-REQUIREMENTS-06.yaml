abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility\n
    \  Management (DMM) in IPv6 deployments.  The hierarchical structure in\n   traditional
    wireless networks has led to deployment models which are\n   in practice centralized.
    \ Mobility management with logically\n   centralized mobility anchoring in current
    mobile networks is prone to\n   suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues.
    \ Such centralized\n   functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably\n
    \  introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network\n   operations
    related to mobility management.  The objective is to\n   enhance mobility management
    in order to meet the primary goals in\n   network evolution, i.e., improve scalability,
    avoid single points of\n   failure, enable transparent mobility support to upper
    layers only\n   when needed, and so on.  Distributed mobility management must
    be\n   secure and may co-exist with existing network deployments and end\n   hosts.\n\n\n\t
