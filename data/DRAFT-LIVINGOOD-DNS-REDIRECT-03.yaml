  content: "\n\t <p>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called\nDNS
    Redirect services deployed today by Internet Service Providers\n(ISPs), DNS Application
    Service Providers (ASPs), and other\norganizations providing so-called DNS Redirect
    services via their\nrecursive DNS servers, as well as to describe the recommended\npractices
    regarding relating to DNS redirect.  This document\nspecifically and narrowly
    addresses those cases where DNS Redirect is\nbeing utilized to provide a web error
    redirect service to end users,\nand describes the critical implications for DNS
    Redirect when DNSSEC\nis deployed.\n\t </p>\n      "
