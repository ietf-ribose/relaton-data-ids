abstract:
  content: "<p>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in thempresents
    a number of bootstrapping problems. While those hardproblems are under discussion,
    this draft proposes a small set ofmechanisms which are intended to be generically
    useful forproviding pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks in web pages,email
    messages, and other textual media. While the mechanismsdescribed below each meet
    similar needs, they are not mutuallyexclusive; it is expected that each will find
    some usefuldeployment during the early days of peer-to-peer overlaydeployment.</p>"
