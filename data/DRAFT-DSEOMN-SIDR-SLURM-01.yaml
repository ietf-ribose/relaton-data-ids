abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global\n
    \  authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those\n   resources.  Internet
    Service Providers (ISPs) can use the RPKI to\n   validate BGP route origination
    assertions.  Some ISPs locally use BGP\n   with private address space or private
    AS numbers (see RFC6890).\n   These local BGP routes cannot be verified by the
    global RPKI, and\n   SHOULD be considered invalid based on the global RPKI (see
    RFC6491).\n   The mechanisms described below provide ISPs with a way to make local\n
    \  assertions about private (reserved) INRs while using the RPKI's\n   assertions
    about all other INRs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
