abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource
    attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs). Such SIDs are referred to as
    resource-aware SIDs in this document. The resource- aware SIDs retain their original
    forwarding semantics, but with the additional semantics to identify the set of
    network resources available for the packet processing action. The resource-aware
    SIDs can therefore be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources.
    In addition, the resource-aware SIDs can also be used to build SR based virtual
    networks, which provide the network topology and resource attributes required
    by customers or services. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment
    routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane
    (SRv6).</p>"
