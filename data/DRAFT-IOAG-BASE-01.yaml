abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Billing and Accounting System Exchange (BASE) protocol is
    \nintended for use for the data transfer between the subsystems of a \ndistributed
    billing and accounting system. It defines the \ncommunication between central
    billing engines (BEs) and one or more \nlocally or remotely installed billing
    agents (BAs). BAs are used to \nsupply the BEs with load data used for billing
    and accounting \npurposes. BEs are responsible for the process of billing and
    \naccounting as well as for the configuration of the BAs and their \nconnected
    source systems. This document defines and describes the \nBASE protocol. \n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
