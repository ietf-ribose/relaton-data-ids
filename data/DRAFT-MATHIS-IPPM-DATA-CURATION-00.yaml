abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the nomenclature, requirements and
    framework\n   for handling per-sample metadata for a live archive of Internet\n
    \  measurements.  By archive, we mean that once captured, the data MUST\n   NOT
    be altered or deleted.  By live, we mean that new data from\n   ongoing measurements
    are being continuously appended to the archive.\n\n   The purpose of the metadata
    is to support the use of the Scientific\n   Method in the study the archived data.
    \ Under the principle of full\n   disclosure, the Scientific Method requires that
    later researchers be\n   able to repeat earlier studies using the original data,
    but refined\n   by new insights (such as improved calibration) gained from other\n
    \  intervening studies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
