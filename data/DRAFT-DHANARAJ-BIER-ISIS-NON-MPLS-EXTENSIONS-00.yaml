abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture\n
    \  that provides multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow\n   state.  BIER can
    be supported in MPLS and non-MPLS networks.  The\n   common BIER header format
    and encapsulation for MPLS and non-MPLS\n   networks is specified in [RFC8296].\n\n
    \  BIER in Ethernet encapsulation is an example of BIER encapsulation in\n   non-MPLS
    networks.\n\n   [RFC8401] specifies the required extensions to the IS-IS [RFC1195]\n
    \  protocol for the distribution of BIER sub-domain information\n   including
    the Sub-sub-TLV required to support BIER in MPLS\n   encapsulation for MPLS networks.\n\n
    \  This document specifies the required extensions to the IS-IS\n   [RFC1195]
    protocol for supporting BIER in non-MPLS networks using\n   BIER in Ethernet encapsulation.\n\n\t
