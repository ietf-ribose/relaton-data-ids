abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The present invention Internet Protocol Version 16 (IPv16)\n
    \  service for allowing relates to the creation of an extended new\n   version
    of Internet Protocol version 16 and its supports to current\n   technologies and
    future technologies too without any interrupt.\n   I propose New Internet Protocol
    version for technology upgradation\n   and limitless end user connectivity and
    create new classes F and\n   Class H, and Class I for extended to present classes
    and its\n   performed Public, private, protected environment access with UWW\n
    \  for at the User Level, it is performed to operate both I and H\n   Classes
    for Unlimited and Infinity High Security with multicast and\n   Virtual IP address
    each block connectivity for an universal users\n   and interstellar and expand
    universe users allocations.\n\n   IP Address is run single IP address inherited
    desired\n   Sub-IP address and extended upto X power n with Virtual IP and\n   IP
    subsequences upto 2 power of x-n,proposed new series of\n   1024.1024.1024.1024
    and VirtualIP works similar current way,and\n   introduce Universal Wide Web (UWW)
    also Communicate Interstellar\n   objects and Galaxies using Radio Signals are
    integrated with the\n   proposed architecture, and Virtual IP - IPv16 to expand
    the internal\n   space communications very quickly with secured allocated channels.\n
    \  Secured allocated individualrecognized block channels are connected\n   with
    Internet and resolve tointerrupt signals and message transfer\n   delayed problem,
    transfer data with secure way along with working\n   mechanism the same existing
    technologies and IPv16 will adapt\n   identifiedand undefined problems of IPv6
    computer technology\n   and network transmission problems to resolve the gaps
    between\n   IPv6 to IPv16 and supports upcoming future technologies\n   and versions
    too.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
