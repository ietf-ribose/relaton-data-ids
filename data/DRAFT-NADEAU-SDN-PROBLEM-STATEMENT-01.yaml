abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Driven Networks (SDN) is an approach to networks that\n
    \  enables applications to converse with and manipulate the control\n   software
    of network devices and resources. SDNs are comprised of\n   applications, control
    software, and interfaces to services that\n   are hosted in an overlay or logical/virtual
    network as well as\n   those possibly same components that comprise the underlying\n
    \  physical network. Modern applications require the ability\n   to easily interact
    and manipulate these resources. Applications can\n   benefit from knowing the
    available resources and from requesting\n   that the network makes the resources
    available in specific ways.\n   To this end, there is a requirement to couple
    applications more\n   closely to the underlying resources on which they depend,
    consume\n   and interact with.\n\n   SDN infrastructure and components exist in
    most deployed networks\n   today. Some of these components are being standardized
    by various\n   organizations, as as well some being already standardized by the\n
    \  IETF. However, no standards or open specifications currently exist\n   to facilitate
    end-to-end operation of a software defined network,\n   specificlly one that provides
    open APIs for applications to control\n   the network services and functions offered
    by device control planes\n   or other \"controlling\" software. The goal of this
    document is to\n   outline the problem area of SDN for the IETF.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
