abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft requests development of detailed specifications for thetechnical
    and operational requirements for an Internet-basedInternational Emergency Preparedness
    Scheme (IEPS) asdefined by ITU-T Recommendation E.106. Publictelecommunications
    services have long had such ascheme, to ensure priority handling of telephonecommunications,
    such as during natural disasters. As awide range of communication services increasingly
    relyupon the family of specifications related to InternetProtocol (IP), IETF work
    needs to include considerationand provision for supporting IEPS. This work needs
    tobe addressed in two phases concurrently - 1) interfacefor transition from today's
    public switched telephonenetwork (PSTN) to IP-based network telephony services,and
    2) additional and enhanced capabilities, such asapplication-specific IEPS services.
    An Email list for discussionand a Web site for background and documents has been
    establishedto assist the work</p>"
