abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering
    Point\n   (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service\n
    \  provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through\n   which
    the call originated may have information about the call, the\n   caller or the
    location which the PSAP may be able to use.  This\n   document describes data
    structures and a mechanism to convey such\n   data to the PSAP.  The mechanism
    uses a Uniform Resource Identifier\n   (URI), which may point to either an external
    resource or an object in\n   the body of the SIP message.  The mechanism thus
    allows the data to\n   be passed by reference (when the URI points to an external
    resource)\n   or by value (when it points into the body of the message).  This\n
    \  follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization\n   work
    where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling\n   (i.e., in body
    of the SIP message) and also by reference.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
