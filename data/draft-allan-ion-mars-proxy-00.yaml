abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has been proposed as an accessvehicle
    for public ATM networks. Support for multicast in thisenvironment via either RAS
    replication, or a adding MARS client side byside with PPP is problematic on several
    fronts. This document describes how an ATM attached system can act as a MARSproxy
    on behalf of a PPP client. This solution circumvents many of theassociated problems
    with respect to VC frugality, scalability, andauthentication.</p>"
