abstract:
- content: "<p>In dense topologies (such as data center fabrics based on the Clos
    and butterfly, though not limited to these topologies), flooding mechanisms designed
    for sparse topologies can flood excessively, or carry too many copies of topology
    and reachability to fabric devices. This results in slower convergence times and
    higher resource utilization. The modifications to the flooding mechanism in the
    Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link state protocol described
    in this document reduce resource utilization to a minimum, while increasing convergence
    performance in dense topologies. Note that a Clos fabric is used as the primary
    example of a dense flooding topology throughout this document. However, the flooding
    optimizations described in this document apply to any dense topology.</p>"
