abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the concept of Beyond Edge Computing
    (BEC)\n   which brings edge computing capabilities down to the level of\n   customers'
    premises for industrial IoT use cases.  The purpose of the\n   document is to
    discuss the general problem statement of BEC including\n   capabilities, and use
    cases.  Potential technical gaps in IETF\n   problem scope that are related to
    BEC are also evaluated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
