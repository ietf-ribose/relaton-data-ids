abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations
    of pervasive attack on Internet communications. This document considers the implications
    of protocol designs which associate metadata with encrypted flows. In particular,
    it asserts that designs which do so by explicit actions of the end system are
    preferable to designs in which middleboxes insert them.</p>"
