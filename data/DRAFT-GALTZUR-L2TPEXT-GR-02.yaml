abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the
    \nnegative effects on L2TP traffic caused by L2TP Control Connection \nEndpoint
    (LCCE) control plane restart, specifically by the restart of \nits control protocol
    component, on LCCEs that are capable of \npreserving the L2TP forwarding component
    ( a.k.a. the L2TP data \nplane) across the restart. \nThe mechanism described
    in this document is applicable to all LCCEs, \nboth those with the ability to
    preserve Forwarding State during the \ncontrol plane (CP) restart and those without
    (although the latter \nneeds to implement only a subset of the mechanism described
    in this \ndocument).\n\t </p>\n      "
