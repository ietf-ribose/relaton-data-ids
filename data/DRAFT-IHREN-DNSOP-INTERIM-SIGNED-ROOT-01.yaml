abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of
    a\ntransition from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such that\nthe data
    in the root zone is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures to\nallow validation.\nThe
    underlying reason for signing the root is to be able to provide\na more secure
    DNS hierarchy, where it is possible to distinguish\nfalse answers from correct
    answers. \nFor the special case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme is\nproposed.
    This scheme is mostly aimed at securing the root zone\nitself for technical and
    operational reasons, and to give\noperational experience of DNSSEC.\n\t </p>\n
