abstract:
- content: "<p>With Segment Routing (SR) architecture [rfc8402], a unicast flow can
    be routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified in the packet,
    w/o the need for per-flow state in the network. As a result, the otherwise needed
    protocols to signal the per-flow unicast state can also be removed from the network.
    This document discusses options for multicast in an SR network.</p>"
