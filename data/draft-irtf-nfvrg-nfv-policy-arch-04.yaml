abstract:
- content: "<p>A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support NFV environments,
    where policies are used to enforce business rules and to specify resource constraints
    in a number of subsystems. This document approaches the policy framework and architecture
    from the perspective of overall orchestration requirements for services involving
    multiple subsystems. The framework extends beyond common orchestration constraints
    across compute, network, and storage subsystems to include energy conservation.
    This document also analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, static
    versus dynamic versus autonomic policies, policy actions and translations, policy
    conflict detection and resolution, interactions among policies engines, and a
    hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address the demanding and growing
    requirements of NFV environments. These findings may also be applicable to cloud
    infrastructures in general.</p>"
