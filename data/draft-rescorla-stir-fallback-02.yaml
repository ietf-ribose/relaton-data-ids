abstract:
- content: "<p>The PASSporT format defines a token that can be carried by signaling
    protocols, including SIP, to cryptographically attest the identify of callers.
    Not all telephone calls use Internet signaling protocols, however, and some calls
    use them for only part of their signaling path. This document describes use cases
    that require the delivery of PASSporT objects outside of the signaling path, and
    defines architectures and semantics to provide this functionality.</p>"
