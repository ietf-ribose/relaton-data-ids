abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enterprise and security focused OAuth providers typically want\n
    \  additional signals to confirm user presence when users return to\n   previously
    authorized apps.  Rather than requiring a full\n   reauthentication, or require
    enrollment in a mobile device management\n   solution, some authorization servers
    may be willing to accept device\n   posture signals from the app, like the fact
    that device has a lock\n   screen, as confirmation of user presence.  This document
    details how\n   OAuth native app clients can communicate device posture signals
    to\n   OAuth providers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
