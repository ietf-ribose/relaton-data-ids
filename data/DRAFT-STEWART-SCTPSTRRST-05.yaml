abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the
    ability\n   to \"reset\" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to
    start\n   the numbering sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with a\n   corresponding
    notification to the upper layer that this act as been\n   performed.  The applications
    that have requested this feature\n   normally desire it so that they can \"re-use\"
    streams for different\n   purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number
    for the\n   application to track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature,\n
    \  a new use on an old stream would result in message numbers larger\n   than
    expected without a protocol mechanism to \"start the streams back\n   at zero\".
    \ This documents presents also a method for resetting the\n   transport sequence
    numbers and all stream sequence numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
