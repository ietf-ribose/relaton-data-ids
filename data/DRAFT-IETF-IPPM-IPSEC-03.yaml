abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The O/TWAMP security mechanism requires that both the client
    and\n   server endpoints possess a shared secret.  Since the currently-\n   standardized
    O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a pre-shared\n   key mode, large scale
    deployment of O/TWAMP is hindered\n   significantly.  At the same time, recent
    trends point to wider IKEv2\n   deployment which, in turn, calls for mechanisms
    and methods that\n   enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure
    one-way and\n   two-way network performance in a standardized manner.  This document\n
    \  discusses the use of keys derived from an IKEv2 SA as the shared key\n   in
    O/TWAMP.  If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, O/\n   TWAMP can
    support certificate-based key exchange, which would allow\n   for more operational
    flexibility and efficiency.  The key derivation\n   presented in this document
    can also facilitate automatic key\n   management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
