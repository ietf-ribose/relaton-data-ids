abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Both address families
    and their related protocol suites support multicast of the single-source and any-source
    varieties. During IPv6 transition, there will be scenarios where a backbone network
    running one IP address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP),
    while the attached client networks running another IP address family (referred
    to as external IP or E-IP). The I-IP backbone should offer both unicast and multicast
    transit services to the client E-IP networks. Softwire Mesh is a solution providing
    E-IP unicast and multicast support across an I-IP backbone. This document describes
    the mechanism for supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and
    I-IP networks supporting softwire mesh. We focus on IPv4- over-IPv6 scenario in
    this document, due to lack of real-world use cases for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.</p>"
