abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Rules of an authorization policy prescribe under which conditions
    an\n   entity or subject has which permissions.  Existing policies support\n   identity-based
    authorization by matching the authenticated identity\n   of the entity requesting
    access to a resource with the available\n   policies.  This document is about
    formulating policy rules that\n   express conditions with respect to SAML assertions,
    thereby\n   supporting non-identity-based authorization and anonymity.\n\t </p>\n
