    and remote computing and storage resources, which wasinitially derived from the
    remote desktop administration but with newbusiness models and very different use
    cases. Most of existing VDIsystems are based on proprietary implementation, and
    positioningdifferent market with different features. Since virtual desktoptechnology
    is believed that it will become a mainstream applicationdelivery method similar
    to the http protocol with regard to webapplications, so it's important to make
    the virtual desktop accessprotocol open and standard. This draft summarizes the
    limitations ofexisting virtual desktop systems, and proposes the intentstandardization
