abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes security extensions that are applicable
    to\nP2PSIP overlays that follow the base protocol described in the WG\nleading
    drafts. The proposed extensions exploit symmetric/asymmetric\ncryptography and
    a key refresh mechanism to protect the signaling\nexchanged between the participating
    peers in order to enhance the\nrobustness of the system against several types
    of attacks that are\ncommon to peer-to-peer networks. The refresh mechanism is
    either\nsupervised by higher-level trusted peers or exclusively controlled by\nthe
    members of the overlay.\n\t </p>\n      "
