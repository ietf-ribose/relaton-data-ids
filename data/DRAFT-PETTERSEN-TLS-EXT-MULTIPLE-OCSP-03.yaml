abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a replacement of the TLS Certificate
    Status\n   Extension to allow clients to specify and support multiple\n   certificate
    status methods.  Also being introduced is a new OCSP-\n   based method that servers
    can use to provide status information not\n   just about the server's own certificate,
    but also the status of\n   intermediate certificates in the chain.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
