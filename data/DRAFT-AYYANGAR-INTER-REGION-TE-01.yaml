abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance
    of\nMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) that traverse\nmultiple
    regions, where a region could be an IGP Area or an Autonomous\nSystem or a GMPLS
    overlay network. This document also outlines different\nmechanisms that an operator
    could employ within his region to facilitate\nthe setup of these inter-region
    TE LSPs.\n\t </p>\n      "
