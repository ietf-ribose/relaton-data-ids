abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides recommendations on the use of the secure
    hash\n   functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 specified in FIPS 180. SHA-\n   512/224
    and SHA-512/256 are SHA-512-based and truncated to match the\n   output size of
    SHA-224 and SHA-256. On 64-bit platforms, the SHA-512-\n   truncated algorithms
    provide better performance than their comparably\n   sized SHA-224 and SHA-256
    variants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
