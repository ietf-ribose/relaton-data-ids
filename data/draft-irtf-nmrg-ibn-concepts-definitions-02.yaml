abstract:
- content: <p>Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry by
    storm. At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often inconsistently,
    in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "Policy". This
    document clarifies the concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of functionality
    that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared
    understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as foundation
    to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and
    their solutions.</p>
