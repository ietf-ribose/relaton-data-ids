abstract:
  content: "\t <t>DNS queries and responses are available over a variety of transports(UDP/TCP)
    and may be ported to use other transports in the future.Current use profiles show
    that most user generated DNS trafficprefers one transport over another. This historical
    usage patternhas or may lead to the presumption that any DNS traffic, regardlessof
    transport, should be considered on equal footing.</p>"
