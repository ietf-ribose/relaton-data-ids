abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>GMPLS [1] provides ideally a robust and flexible control plane
    \nprotocols set designed for application over generalized transport \nnetwork.
    A typical application of GMPLS is, among others, the control \nof transport networks
    based on SDH/SONET [2] technology. In this \nscenario, the introduction of GMPLS
    based control plane should ensure \nsupport of and/or compatibility with the most
    important and widely \nexploited SDH/SONET features, making possible a seamless
    interworking \nwith inherent data plane requirements. In this document we focus
    on \none of the most attractive SDH/SONET protection mechanism, \nimplemented
    through MS-SPRing (G.841 [3]), a widely deployed ITU \nstandard for ring-shared
    protection.  \n\t </p>\n      "
