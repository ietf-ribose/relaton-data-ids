abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complexgrowth
    of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs alongthe Core network,
    is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainlyderived from a \"Network-Oriented
    point of view\", and therefore ageneral perspective, not focused on specific services
    - with some morePerformance factors, so to include a \"Service-Oriented point
    of view\",more centred on the particular kind of service, with its owncharacteristics
    in terms of protocol, application, manageability, andso on.Almost nothing about
    this new approach has been standardized yet forthe core network.To achieve the
    above goal, and starting from the one-to-groupperformance metrics outlined in
    RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metricscomposition/aggregation framework is proposed
    in this memo, where themain focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video
    providers,online biding, online stock market, etc.).Finally this memo is tuned
    to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,framework concepts, and need to widen
    the current performance metricsdepending on the application, service etc.</p>"
