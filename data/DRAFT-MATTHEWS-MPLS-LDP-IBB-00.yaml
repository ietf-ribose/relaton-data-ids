abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This contribution proposes modifications to the LDP and CR-LDP
    \nprotocols that allow an LDP or CR-LDP session to be reestablished \nusing a
    new TCP connection if the old TCP connection goes down \nunexpectedly. It also
    proposes that, in certain situations, an LSR \ncontinue to use the label bindings
    associated with a session for a \nshort time after the session goes down, to allow
    forwarding to \ncontinue uninterrupted while the two peer LSRs attempt to \nreestablish
    the session. These modifications allow an LSR to easily \nimplement hitless software
    upgrades and hitless activity switches.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
