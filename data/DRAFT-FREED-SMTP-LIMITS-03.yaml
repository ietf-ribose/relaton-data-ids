abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a \"Limits\" extension for the Simple
    Mail\n   Transfer Protocol (SMTP), including submisssion, as well as the Local\n
    \  Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP).  It also defines an associated limit\n   registry.
    \ This extension provides the means for an SMTP, submission,\n   or LMTP server
    to inform the client of limits the server intends to\n   apply to the protocol
    during the current session.  The client is then\n   able to adapt its behavior
    in order to conform to those limits.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
