abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides some guidelines for email clients that
    support\n   Email Address Internationalization (EAI) as outlined in [RFC6530].
    \ A\n   number of interoperability cases between different versions of email\n
    \  components are reviewed.  Recommendations are made to improve\n   interoperability
    and usability and to minimize discrepancies between\n   the display of composed
    and received email in different language\n   environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
