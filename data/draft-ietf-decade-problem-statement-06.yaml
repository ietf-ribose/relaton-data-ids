abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks. In P2P applications,
    one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce
    storage capabilities within the network. Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web
    caches) provide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches need to
    explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do not allow users
    to manage resource usage policies for content in the cache. This document discusses
    the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications and shows the need
    for a standard protocol for accessing this storage. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
