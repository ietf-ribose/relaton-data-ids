abstract:
- content: "<p>The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability to
    simultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a given optical network.
    Optical multi-granularity and particularly waveband switching raises some issues
    for GMPLS. These have been partially addressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG]
    from the CCAMP Working Group. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networks
    demands the definition of a more complete set of requirements considering the
    management, control, routing and signaling issues and their impacts in the GMPLS
    protocols suite.</p>"
