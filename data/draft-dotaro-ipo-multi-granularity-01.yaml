abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability
    tosimultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a givenoptical
    network. Optical multi-granularity and particularly wavebandswitching raises some
    issues for GMPLS. These have been partiallyaddressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG]
    from the CCAMP WorkingGroup. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networksdemands
    the definition of a more complete set of requirementsconsidering the management,
    control, routing and signaling issuesand their impacts in the GMPLS protocols
    suite.</p>"
