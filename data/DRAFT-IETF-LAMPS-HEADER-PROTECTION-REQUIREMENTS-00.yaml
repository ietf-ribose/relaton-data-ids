abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Privacy and security issues with email header protection in
    S/MIME\n   have been identified for some time.  However, the desire to fix these\n
    \  issue has been expressed in the IETF LAMPS Working Group only\n   recently.
    \ The existing S/MIME specification is likely to be updated\n   regarding header
    protection.\n\n   Several LAMPS WG participants expressed the opinion that whatever\n
    \  mechanism will be chosen, it should not be limited to S/MIME, but\n   also
    applicable to PGP/MIME.\n\n   This document describes the problem statement, generic
    use cases, and\n   requirements.  Additionally it drafts possible solutions to
    address\n   the challenge.  Finally some best practices are collected.\n\n\t </p>\n
