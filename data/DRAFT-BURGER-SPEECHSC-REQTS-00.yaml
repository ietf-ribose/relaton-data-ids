abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol
    to \ncontrol distributed speech processing of audio streams.  By speech \nprocessing,
    this document specifically means automatic speech \nrecognition, speaker verification
    and text-to-speech.  Other IETF \nprotocols, such as SIP and RTSP, address rendezvous
    and control for \ngeneralized media streams.  However, speech processing presents
    \nadditional requirements that none of the extant IETF protocols \naddress. \nDiscussion
    of this and related documents is on the MRCP list.  To \nsubscribe, send the message
    'subscribe mrcp' to \nmajordomo@snowshore.com.  The public archive is at \nhttp://flyingfox.snowshore.com/mrcp_archive/maillist.html.
    \nNOTE: This mailing list will be superseded by an official working \ngroup mailing
    list, cats@ietf.org, once the WG is formally \nchartered. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
