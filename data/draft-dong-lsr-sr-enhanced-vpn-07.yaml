abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used to support
    one or a group of VPN+ services. This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with
    necessary extensions to advertise the associated topology and resource attributes
    for scalable Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs. Each VTN can have a customized topology
    and a set of network resources allocated from the physical network. Multiple VTNs
    may shared the same topology, and multiple VTNs may share the same set of network
    resources on some network segments. A group of resource-aware SIDs are allocated
    for each VTN. This allows flexible combination of the network topology and network
    resource attributes to build a relatively large number of VTNs with a small number
    of logical topologies. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both Segment Routing
    with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).
    This document also describes the mechanisms of using dedicated VTN-ID in the data
    plane instead of the per-VTN resource-aware SIDs to further reduce the control
    plane overhead.</p>"
