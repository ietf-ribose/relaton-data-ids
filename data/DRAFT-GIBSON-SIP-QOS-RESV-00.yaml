abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol
    to\nperform route reservation. These modifications are applied to two of\nthe
    existing SIP Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modifications\nallow the INVITE
    method to be used to find the best path across a\nparticular network based on
    QoS metrics. The route choice is able to\nbe restricted at the network edge. The
    proposed modifications also\nallow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of
    disseminating\ninformation necessary to determine these QoS metrics. This\ninformation
    can be used to route INVITEs away from known areas of\ncongestion.\n\t </p>\n
