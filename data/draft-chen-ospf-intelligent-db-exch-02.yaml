abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an intelligent database exchange mechanism for
    the database exchange procedure in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. This mechanism is backward
    compatible. It eliminates the unnecessary database exchanges through using the
    existing reachability information calculated from the link state database and
    the un-reachability information about routers recorded. It significantly speeds
    up the establishment of the full adjacency between two routers in some situations.</p>"
