abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism that can be used to increase the
    speed at which link state information is flooded across a network when multiple
    LSPDUs need to be flooded, such as in case of a node failure. It also reduces
    the likelihood of overloading the downstream flooding neighbors. This document
    defines a new TLV to be advertised in IS-IS Hello messages. This TLV carries two
    parameters indicating the performance capacity to receive LSPDUs: the minimum
    delay between two consecutive LSPDUs and the number of LSPDUs which can the received
    back to back.</p>"
