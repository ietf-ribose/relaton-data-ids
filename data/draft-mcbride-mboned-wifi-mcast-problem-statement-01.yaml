abstract:
- content: <p>There have been known issues with multicast, in an 802.11 environment,
    which have prevented the deployment of multicast in these wifi environments. IETF
    multicast experts have been meeting together to discuss these issues and provide
    IEEE updates. The mboned working group is chartered to receive regular reports
    on the current state of the deployment of multicast technology, create "practice
    and experience" documents that capture the experience of those who have deployed
    and are deploying various multicast technologies, and provide feedback to other
    relevant working groups. As such, this document will gather the problems of wifi
    multicast into one problem statement document so as to offer the community guidance
    on current limitations.</p>
