abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification presents an approach to increase the security of
    block cipher operation modes based on re-keying (with no additional keys needed)
    during each separate message processing. It provides an internal re-keying mechanism
    called ACPKM. This mechanism doesn't require additional secret parameters or complicated
    transforms - for key update only the base encryption function is used.</p>"
