abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a modified TCP Timestamps mechanism called
    \"TS2\".\n   It uses the existing \"TCP Timestamps option\" specified in RFC1323
    and\n   a new TCP option called \"the TCP Old Timestamps option\", which is\n
    \  specified in this memo.  As a fallback, an RFC1323-compatible mode\n   called
    \"TS1\" is also available.\n\n   The base mechanism of TS2 includes the definitions
    of those two TCP\n   Timestamps options, mode negotiation to enable TS1 or TS2,
    and a rule\n   for updating internal states.  The applied mechanisms of TS2 include\n
    \  an accurate RTT measurement mechanism that is correct even for\n   duplicate
    ACK segments (RTTM/TS2), a reordering-robust mechanism to\n   detect wrapped sequence
    numbers (PAWS/TS2), a lightweight mechanism\n   to detect spoofed segments (PASA/TS2),
    a loss inference mechanism\n   applicable to both original and retransmitted data
    segments\n   (DLI/TS2), and a spurious loss inference detection mechanism that\n
    \  operates without waiting for one RTT by sending arbitrary in-window\n   data
    (SLID/TS2).\n\t </p>\n      "
