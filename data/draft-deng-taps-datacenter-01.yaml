abstract:
- content: "<p>It is noticed that within a data center, unique traffic pattern and
    performance goals for the transport layer exist, as compared to things on the
    Internet. This draft discusses the usecases for applying transport APIs from the
    perspective of an application running in a data center environment, and proposes
    potential requirements for such API design.</p>"
