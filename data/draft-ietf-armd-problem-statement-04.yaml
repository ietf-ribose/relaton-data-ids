abstract:
  content: "<p>This document examines address resolution issues related to the scaling
    of data centers with a very large number of hosts. The scope of this document
    is relatively narrow, focusing on address resolution (the Address Resolution Protocol
    (ARP) in IPv4 and Neighbor Discovery (ND) in IPv6) within a data center. This
    document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>"
