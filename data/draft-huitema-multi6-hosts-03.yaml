abstract:
  content: "<p>A way to solve the issue of site multihoming is to have a separatesite
    prefix for each connection of the site, and to derive as manyaddresses for each
    hosts. This approach to multi-homing, which wecall Host-Centric IPv6 Multihoming,
    has the advantage of minimalimpact on the inter-domain routing fabric, since each
    site prefix canbe aggregated within the larger prefix of a specific provider;however,
    it opens a number of issues, which we will discuss in thismemo, including the
    problem created by the interaction betweeningress filtering and multihoming, which
    we analyze in detail. Wethen propose a set of specific solutions that enable host
    centricmultihoming, and we review how these solutions meet the requirementsof
    IPv6 site multihoming.</p>"
