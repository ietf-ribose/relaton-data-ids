abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved\n
    \       in the design of a new transport protocol for multiplexed\n        voice
    within a single packet. The intended application is\n        the interconnection
    of devices which provide trunking or\n        long distance telephone service
    over the Internet. Such\n        devices have many voice connections simultaneously
    between\n        them. Multiplexing them into the same connection improves\n        on
    the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice\n        codecs, and improves
    scalability. Options and issues con-\n        cerning timestamping, payload type
    identification, length\n        indication, and channel identification are discussed.
    Sev-\n        eral possible header formats are identified, and their\n        efficiencies
    are compared.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
