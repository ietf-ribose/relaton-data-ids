abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step,file
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a fileonto a remote host.This
    document describes the TFTP multicast option. This optionallows multiple clients
    to receive the same file concurrentlythrough the use of Multicast packets. The
    TFTP Option Extensionmechanism is described in [2].Often when similar computers
    are booting remotely they will eachdownload the same image file. By adding multicast
    into the TFTPoption set, two or more computers can download a fileconcurrently,
    thus increasing network efficiency.This document assumes that the reader is familiar
    with theterminology and notation of both [1] and [2].</p>"
