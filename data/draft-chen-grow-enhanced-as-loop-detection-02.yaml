abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to enhance AS-Loop Detection for BGP Inbound/
    Outbound Route Processing. It is an enhancement to the current BGP's Inbound/Outbound
    processing and can be implemented directly on the device. This could empower networks
    to quickly and accurately figure out they're being victimized.</p>"
