abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFCs 6513, 6514, and other RFCs describe procedures by which
    a\n   Service Provider may offer Multicast VPN service to its customers.\n   These
    procedures create point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to-\n   multipoint
    trees across the Service Provider's backbone.  One type of\n   P2MP tree that
    may be used is known as an \"Ingress Replication (IR)\n   tunnel\".  In an IR
    tunnel, a parent node need not be \"directly\n   connected\" to its child nodes.
    \ When a parent node has to send a\n   multicast data packet to its child nodes,
    it does not use layer 2\n   multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.
    \ Rather, it\n   makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy, through
    an IP\n   or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.  While the prior\n
    \  MVPN specifications allow the use of IR tunnels, those specifications\n   are
    not always very clear or explicit about how the MVPN protocol\n   elements and
    procedures are applied to IR tunnels.  This document\n   updates RFCs 6513 and
    6514 by adding additional details that are\n   specific to the use of IR tunnels.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
