abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes issues and approaches related to aggregation\n
    \  of QoS requests, when RSVP [BZB+97] is the protocol used to convey\n   such
    requests.  Aggregation is an important component to provide\n   scalable QoS solutions,
    especially in the core of the backbone\n   where the sheer number of flows mandates
    some form of aggregation.\n   However, aggregation needs to be provided without
    impacting the\n   ability to provide end-to-end QoS guarantees to individual flows.\n
    \  In this document, we review some of the main goals of aggregation\n   and describe
    possible solutions, that do not preclude support for\n   end-to-end QoS guarantees.
    \ Those solutions are targeted at unicast\n   flows as we expect them to represent
    a large fraction of the flows\n   requesting reservation, and hence to be the
    main contributors to\n   potential scalability problems with RSVP.\n\t </p>\n
