abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document describes procedure for sending and processing probe query and response
    messages for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure
    uses the messages defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
    Light) for Delay Measurement, and uses the messages defined in this document for
    Loss Measurement. The procedure described is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data
    planes and is used for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies.</p>"
