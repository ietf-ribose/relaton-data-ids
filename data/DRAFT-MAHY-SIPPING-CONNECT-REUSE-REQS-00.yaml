abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a\nrequest,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral\nport.  The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure that\nresponses to a request, and new requests
    sent in original direction\nreuse an existing connection.  However, new requests
    sent in the\nopposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing connection.\nThis
    frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one connection\nfor requests sent
    in each direction, and can result in potential\nscaling and performance problems.
    \ This document presents\nrequirements for addressing this shortcoming, and separately
    proposes\nan example mechanism which addresses this deficiency.\n\t </p>\n      "
