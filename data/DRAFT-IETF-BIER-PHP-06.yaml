abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider
    tunnel\n   for Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN).  Global Table Multicast\n
    \  [RFC7716] or Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN).  It is possible\n   that
    not all routers in the provider network support BIER and there\n   are various
    methods to handle BIER-incapable transit routers.\n   However those methods assume
    the MVPN/EVPN Provider Edges (PEs) are\n   BIER-capable.  This document specifies
    a method to allow BIER-\n   incapable routers to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER
    as the transport,\n   by having the upstream BIER Forwarding Router (BFR) that
    is connected\n   directly or indirectly via a tunnel to a BIER-incapable PE remove
    the\n   BIER header and send the payload to the PE.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
