abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using\n
    \  adjacency-sids, node-sids, and binding-sids.  It is important to\n   provide
    fast reroute (FRR) mechanisms to respond to failures of links\n   and nodes in
    the Segment-Routed Traffic-Engineered(SR-TE) path.  A\n   point of local repair
    (PLR) can provide FRR protection against the\n   failure of a link in an SR-TE
    path by examining only the first (top)\n   label in the SR label stack.  In order
    to protect against the failure\n   of a node, a PLR may need to examine the second
    label in the stack as\n   well, in order to determine SR-TE path beyond the failed
    node.  This\n   document specifies how a PLR can use the first and second label
    in\n   the label stack describing an SR-TE path to provide protection\n   against
    node failures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
