abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes extensions to existing NFSv4 operations
    to\n   allow file extended attributes (here forth also referred to as\n   xattrs)
    to be manipulated in the protocol. An xattr is a file system\n   feature that
    allows opaque metadata, not interpreted by the file\n   system, to be associated
    with files and directories and are supported\n   by many modern file systems.
    New file attributes are proposed to\n   allow clients to query the server for
    xattr support, and new\n   operations to get and set xattrs on file system objects.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
