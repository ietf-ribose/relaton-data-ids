abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides some exemplary use cases for service function
    chaining in mobile service provider networks. The objective of this draft is not
    to cover all conceivable service chains in detail. Rather, the intention is to
    localize and explain the application domain of service chaining within mobile
    networks as far as it is required to complement the problem statement and framework
    statements of the working group. Service function chains typically reside in a
    LAN segment which links the mobile access network to the actual application platforms
    located in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere else in the Internet. Service
    function chains ensure a fair distribution of network resources according to agreed
    service policies, enhance the performance of service delivery, take care of security
    and privacy or support application and business support platforms. General considerations
    and specific use cases are presented in this document to demonstrate the different
    technical requirements of these goals for service function chaining in mobile
    service provider networks.</p>"
