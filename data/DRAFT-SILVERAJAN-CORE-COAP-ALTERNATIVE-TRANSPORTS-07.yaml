abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and\n   transmitted
    using UDP or DTLS as transports.  These transports are\n   optimal solutions for
    CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments\n   and nodes.  However compelling
    motivation exists for understanding\n   how CoAP can operate with other transports,
    such as the need for M2M\n   communication using non-IP networks, improved transport
    level end-to-\n   end reliability and security, NAT and firewall traversal issues,
    and\n   mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/HTTP\n   translation
    gateways.  This draft examines the requirements for\n   conveying CoAP messages
    to end points over such alternative\n   transports.  It also provides a new URI
    format for representing CoAP\n   resources over alternative transports.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
