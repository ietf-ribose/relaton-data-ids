abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting video,
    there is a need for receivers of the video to setup appropriate expectations on
    their receive capacity for handling various video image resolutions. Setting up
    the maximum supported image resolution that could be handled by an Endpoint is
    important to successfully decode and render the received video streams. This document
    proposes SDP format specific parameters for specifying the maximum image width
    and height resolutions along with their behavior under the [RFC3264] Offer/Answer
    SDP usage.</p>"
