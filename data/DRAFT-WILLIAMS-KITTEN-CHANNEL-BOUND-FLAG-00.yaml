abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a \"channel bound\"
    return\n   flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()\n
    \  functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior,\n   and
    a behavior that is only safe when the application specifically\n   tells the Generic
    Security Services Application Programming Interface\n   (GSS-API) that it (the
    applicaiton) supports the new behavior.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
