abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Global IPv6 deployment is expected. Many solutions have been \n
    \  specified in order to provide IPv6 connectivity service. In order to \n   provide
    IPv6 connectivity service to all kinds of host/client devices, \n   ISP networks
    may need to support as many as possible IPv6 \n   connectivity solutions. This
    document proposes a hybrid ISP framework \n   that supports the coexistence of
    various IPv6 connectivity solutions \n   and analyses the configuration requirements
    raised by this framework. \n   Additionally, the applicability of different configuration
    mechanisms \n   for performing this configuration is discussed.\n\t </p>\n      "
