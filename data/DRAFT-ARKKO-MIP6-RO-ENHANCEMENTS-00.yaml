abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mobile IPv6 mobility-management protocol enables minimum
    routing\n   paths between a mobile node and a correspondent node, which may\n
    \  itself be mobile. This feature is called route optimization. Route\n   optimization
    requires authorization of initially unacquainted and\n   untrusted parties. A
    so-called return-routability procedure was\n   integrated into the Mobile IPv6
    in order to do this securely. The\n   return-routability procedure equips the
    mobile node with\n   cryptographic tokens that authenticate the mobile node and
    prove the\n   mobile node's presence at a claimed new location after movement.\n
    \  Recently, a number of improvements or optional alternatives have been\n   suggested
    to the standard procedure. The primary driver between these\n   improvements is
    oftentimes further reduction of signaling messages\n   and latency, but other
    improvements such as better security have also\n   been suggested. This document
    discusses the potential goals for\n   future enhancements of route optimization,
    the security threats that\n   such enhancements must consider, and the various
    enhancement\n   proposals and their key ideas. An evaluation of some recent proposals\n
    \  is included, as well as a discussion of how significant the Mobile\n   IPv6
    related optimizations are related to other ongoing optimization\n   efforts. Finally,
    needs for future research are outlined.\n\t </p>\n      "
