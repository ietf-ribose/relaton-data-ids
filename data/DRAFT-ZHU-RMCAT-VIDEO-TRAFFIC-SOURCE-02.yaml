abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two reference video traffic source
    models for\n   evaluating RMCAT candidate algorithms.  The first model statistically\n
    \  characterizes the behavior of a live video encoder in response to\n   changing
    requests on target video rate.  The second model is trace-\n   driven, and emulates
    the encoder output by scaling the pre-encoded\n   video frame sizes from a widely
    used video test sequence.  Both\n   models are designed to strike a balance between
    simplicity,\n   repeatability, and authenticity in modeling the interactions between\n
    \  a video traffic source and the congestion control module.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
