abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the functionalities and design considerations
    for a Name Resolution Service (NRS) in Information-Centric Networking (ICN). The
    purpose of an NRS in ICN is to translate an object name into some other information
    such as a locator, another name, etc. in order to forward the object request.
    This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group
    (ICNRG).</p>"
