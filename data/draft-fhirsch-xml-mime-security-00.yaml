abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft defines how XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption
    maybe used with Multipart MIME security to provide MIME integrity andconfidentiality.
    It extends RFC 1847 by definingapplication/signature+xml and application/encryption+xml
    protocolsfor the Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted MIME types.Although
    non-XML content may be signed or encrypted based on XMLsigning and encryption,
    additional capabilities are available for XMLMIME content. This draft defines
    a signature transform parameter forpartial signing or manipulation of XML MIME
    content as well asprocessing rules in addition to the XML Digital Signature and
    XMLEncryption processing rules.</p>"
