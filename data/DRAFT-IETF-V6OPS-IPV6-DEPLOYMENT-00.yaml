abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Looking globally, IPv6 is growing faster than IPv4 and this
    means\n   that the collective wisdom of the networking industry has selected\n
    \  IPv6 for the future.  This document provides an overview of IPv6\n   transition
    deployment status and a view on how the transition to IPv6\n   is progressing
    among network operators and enterprises that are\n   introducing IPv6 or have
    already adopted an IPv6-only solution.  It\n   also aims to analyze the transition
    challenges and therefore\n   encourage actions and more investigations on some
    areas that are\n   still under discussion.  The overall IPv6 incentives are also\n
    \  examined.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
