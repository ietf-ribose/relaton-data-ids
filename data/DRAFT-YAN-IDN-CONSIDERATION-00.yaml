abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to pinpoint the work scope of Intelligence
    Driven\n   Network (IDN) and mine the potential standardization work.  Firstly,\n
    \  the problems and new requirements for the existing methods are\n   analyzed.
    \ Numbers of high value use-cases are proposed as examples\n   to instantiate
    them.  A benchmark framework design is proposed, which\n   is important during
    the machine learning and inference process.\n   Finally, a reference model of
    IDN is proposed, based on which the\n   potential standardization work is analyzed.\n\n\n\t
