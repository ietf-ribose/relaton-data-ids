abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors. On route
    reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the best route
    from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the standpoint of the route
    reflectors themselves. Depending on the scaling and precision requirements, route
    selection can be specific for one client, common for a set of clients, or common
    for all clients of a route reflector. This solution is particularly applicable
    in deployments using centralized route reflectors, where choosing the best route
    based on the route reflector's IGP location is suboptimal. This facilitates, for
    example, a "best exit point" policy ("hot potato routing"). The solution relies
    upon all route reflectors learning all paths that are eligible for consideration.
    BGP route selection is performed in the route reflectors based on the IGP cost
    from configured locations in the link-state IGP.</p>
