abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates the experimental Proportional Rate Reduction\n
    \  (PRR) algorithm, described RFC 6937, to standards track.  PRR\n   potentially
    replaces the Fast Recovery and Rate-Halving algorithms.\n   All of these algorithms
    regulate the amount of data sent by TCP or\n   other transport protocol during
    loss recovery.  PRR accurately\n   regulates the actual flight size through recovery
    such that at the\n   end of recovery it will be as close as possible to the ssthresh,
    as\n   determined by the congestion control algorithm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
