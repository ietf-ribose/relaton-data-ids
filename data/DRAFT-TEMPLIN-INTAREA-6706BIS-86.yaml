abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over Overlay Multilink\n
    \  Network (OMNI) interfaces using the Asymmetric Extended Route\n   Optimization
    (AERO) internetworking and mobility management service.\n   AERO/OMNI use an IPv6
    link-local address format that supports\n   operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND) protocol and links ND\n   to IP forwarding.  Prefix delegation/registration
    services are\n   employed for network admission and to manage the routing system.\n
    \  Multilink operation, mobility management, quality of service (QoS)\n   signaling
    and route optimization are naturally supported through\n   dynamic neighbor cache
    updates.  Standard IP multicasting services\n   are also supported.  AERO is a
    widely-applicable mobile\n   internetworking service especially well-suited to
    aviation services,\n   intelligent transportation systems, mobile Virtual Private
    Networks\n   (VPNs) and many other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
