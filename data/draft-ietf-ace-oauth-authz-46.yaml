abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a framework for authentication and authorization
    in Internet of Things (IoT) environments called ACE- OAuth. The framework is based
    on a set of building blocks including OAuth 2.0 and the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), thus transforming a well-known and widely used authorization
    solution into a form suitable for IoT devices. Existing specifications are used
    where possible, but extensions are added and profiles are defined to better serve
    the IoT use cases.</p>"
