  content: "\n\t <p>The Bluetooth technology is intended for a wide range of different\nuser
    devices and will be employed in various devices such as mobile\nphones, PDAs and
    notebooks. To enable communication between these\ndevices and the existing IP
    world, the transmission of IPv4 and IPv6\npackets over Bluetooth has already been
    addressed in the Bluetooth\nLAN access profile and the Bluetooth PAN profile.\n\n\t
