abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The metadata of an RFC can include a tag called \"Updates\"
    which can\n   be used to link a new RFC to an existing RFC.  On publication of
    such\n   an RFC, the existing RFC will include an additional metadata tag\n   called
    \"Updated by\" which provides a link to the new RFC.  However,\n   this tag pair
    is not well-defined and therefore it is currently used\n   for multiple different
    purposes, which leads to confusion about the\n   actual meaning of this tag and
    inconsistency in its use.\n\n   This document recommends the discontinuation of
    the use of the\n   updates/updated by tag pair, and instead proposes three new
    tag pairs\n   that have well-defined meanings and use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
