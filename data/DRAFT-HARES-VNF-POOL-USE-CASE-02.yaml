abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes use cases the author has observed in\n
    \  demonstrations or deployments for virtualized network functions\n   (VNFs)
    supported by VNF Pools.  Several of these demonstrations\n   combined VNF Pools
    into VNFsets.  The use cases were: cloud bursting,\n   parental controls, load
    balancer for multipath (L1-L7), WAN\n   optimization that runs either between
    access nodes and Data Centers,\n   WAN optimization between mobile phones and
    Data Centers (through\n   access nodes), application placement optimization, and
    optimized\n   placement of web applications utilizing minimal data transfer.\n\n\t
