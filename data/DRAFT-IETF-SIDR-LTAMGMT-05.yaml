abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a facility to enable a relying party
    (RP) to\n   manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key\n
    \  Infrastructure (RPKI). It is common to allow an RP to import TA\n   material
    in the form of self-signed certificates. The facility\n   described in this document
    allows an RP to impose constraints on such\n   TAs. Because this mechanism is
    designed to operate in the RPKI\n   context, the relevant constraints are the
    RFC 3779 extensions that\n   bind address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS)
    numbers to\n   entities. The primary motivation for this facility is to enable
    an RP\n   to ensure that resource allocation information that it has acquired\n
    \  via some trusted channel is not overridden by the information\n   acquired
    from the RPKI repository system or by the putative TAs that\n   the RP imports.
    Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to specify a\n   set of bindings between
    public key identifiers and RFC 3779 extension\n   data and will override any conflicting
    bindings expressed via the\n   putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from
    the RPKI repository\n   system. Although this mechanism is designed for local
    use by an RP,\n   an entity that is accorded administrative control over a set
    of RPs\n   may use this mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to a set of RPs\n
    \  within its jurisdiction. The means by which this latter use case is\n   effected
    is outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
