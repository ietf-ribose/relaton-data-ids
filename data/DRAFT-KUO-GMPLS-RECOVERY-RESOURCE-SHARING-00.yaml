abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many protection and restoration (P&amp;R) techniques are proposed
    to \n   protect LSP in GMPLS networks. Provisioning better P&amp;R capability
    \n   requires that more recovery resources be allocated on protection\n   LSP,
    which may lead to resource waste in GMPLS networks.\n   \n   This draft presents
    a scheme of recovery resource sharing with   \n   traffic balancing for GMPLS
    LSP P&amp;R. Its focus is on the \n   discussions of working and protection LSPs
    selection and shared \n   resource allocation and release.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
