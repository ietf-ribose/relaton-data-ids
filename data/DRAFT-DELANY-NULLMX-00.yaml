abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A common strategy of SMTP servers when deciding whether to accept
    an\nemail or not, is to ensure that the 2821.MailFrom contains a domain\nwilling
    to accept non-delivery email (aka bounces).\n\nWhen the 2821.MailFrom domain has
    a DNS MX Resource Record (RR), it is\nmaking an explicit statement that it is
    willing to accept\nemail. However, when the domain has just a DNS A (or AAAA)
    RR, there\nis no such clarity as most hosts on the Internet advertise an A RR\nregardless
    of whether they want to accept email or not.\n\nThe NULL MX RR formalizes the
    existing mechanism by which a domain\ncommunicates that it will never accept email.\n\t
