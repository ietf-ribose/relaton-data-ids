abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current mobility solutions generally introduce an anchor point
    in the\nnetwork, e.g., HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP.  The anchor\npoint
    is used to maintain the mapping between the stable IP address\n(e.g., Home address
    in MIPv6) and the current routable IP address\n(e.g., CoA in MIPv6).  However,
    one of the trend in mobile network\nevolution is to \"flatten\" mobility architecture
    by confining mobility\nsupport in the access network, e.g. at the access routers
    level,\nkeeping the rest of the network unaware of the mobility events and\ntheir
    support.  This document discusses the deployment of current IP\nmobility mechanisms
    in such a flat architecture.\n\t </p>\n      "
