abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7368 'IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles' section
    3.7\n   describes architecture principles related to naming and service\n   discovery
    in residential home networks.\n\n   Customer Edge Routers and other Customer Premises
    Equipment (CPEs)\n   are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks.
    \ Most CPEs\n   assign IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which makes
    them\n   good candidates for hosting the naming service.  IPv6 provides global\n
    \  connectivity, and nodes from the home network will be reachable from\n   the
    global Internet.  As a result, the naming service is expected to\n   be exposed
    on the Internet.\n\n   However, CPEs have not been designed to host such a naming
    service\n   exposed on the Internet.  Running a naming service visible on the\n
    \  Internet may expose the CPEs to resource exhaustion and other\n   attacks,
    which could make the home network unreachable, and most\n   probably would also
    affect the internal communications of the home\n   network.\n\n   In addition,
    regular end users may not understand, or possess the\n   necessary skills to be
    able to perform, DNSSEC management and\n   configuration.  Misconfiguration may
    also result in naming service\n   disruption, thus these end users may prefer
    to rely on third party\n   name service providers.\n\n   This document describes
    a homenet naming architecture, where the CPEs\n   manage the DNS zones associated
    with its own home network, and\n   outsource elements of the naming service (possibly
    including DNSSEC\n   management) to a third party running on the Internet.\n\n\t
