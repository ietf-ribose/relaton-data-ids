abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes the definition of an Explicitly Authenticated\n
    \  Proxy as intermediary of normally unprotected \"http\" URI scheme\n   requests
    and responses of HTTP2 traffic.\n\n   An Explicitly Authenticated Proxy is a message
    forwarding agent that\n   is selected, with explicit user's consent, and configured
    by the user\n   agent to receive exclusively \"http\" URI scheme requests and
    attempt\n   to satisfy those requests on behalf of the user agent.  A client is\n
    \  connected to an Explicitly Authenticated Proxy through an\n   authenticated
    TLS secured connection.\n\n   This document describes a method for a user agent
    to automatically\n   discover and authenticate, and for an user to provide consent
    for an\n   Explicitly Authenticated Proxy.  This enables proxied communication\n
    \  to be encrypted and authenticated, explicitly acknowledged by the\n   user
    agent and visible to the server end point.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
