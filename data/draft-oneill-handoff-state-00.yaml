abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft aims to document an issue raised in the Mobile IP workinggroup
    related to fast handoff between Access Routers. The fasthandoff work aims to rapidly
    enable IP service at the new accessrouter. In Mobile IP this implies that Binding
    Updates at thenetwork layer enable forwarding of packets to the new access router.However,
    it may also imply other network layer activities becausethe IP service given to
    the MN may depend on state which ispresently located in the old access router.
    This draft aims todocument the issue through examples so that the IETF can resolve
    howto approach this issue.</p>"
