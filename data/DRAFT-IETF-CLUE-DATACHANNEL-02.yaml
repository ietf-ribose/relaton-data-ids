abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism,\n
    \  together with the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) in order\n   to
    establish a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data Channel, for\n   transporting
    CLUE protocol messages between two CLUE entities.\n\n   The document defines the
    SCTP considerations specific to a CLUE Data\n   Channel, the SDP offer/answer
    procedures for negotiating the\n   establishment of, and the DCEP procedures for
    opening, a CLUE Data\n   Channel.\n\n   Details and procedures associated with
    the CLUE protocol are outside\n   the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
