abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile networks using LTE, 4G technologies are complex. Managing\n
    \  mobility and content delivery using IP transport is challenging and\n   not
    optimized for content delivery. IP unicast routing from server to\n   clients
    is used for delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment\n   (UE), where each
    user gets separate stream. From bandwidth and\n   routing perspective this approach
    is inefficient. Multicast and\n   broadcast technologies have emerged recently
    for mobile networks, but\n   their deployments are very limited or at an experimental
    stage due to\n   complex architecture and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly\n
    \  emerging technology with built in features for efficient multimedia\n   content
    delivery, however majority of the work is focused either on\n   fixed networks
    or unlicensed WiFi-based wireless networks. The main\n   focus of this document
    is on native deployment of ICN in cellular\n   mobile networks by embedding ICN
    into 3GPP protocol stack at IP\n   datagram or replacing IP for non-IP datagrams.
    ICN has an inherent\n   capability for anchorless mobility, security and it is
    optimized for\n   content delivery using local caching at the edge. We believe
    that ICN\n   native or dual stack (with IP) deployment will bring all inherent\n
    \  benefits and help in optimizing mobile networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
