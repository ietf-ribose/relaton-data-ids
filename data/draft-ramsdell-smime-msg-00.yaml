abstract:
  content: "<p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides aconsistent
    way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on thepopular Internet MIME standard,
    S/MIME provides the followingcryptographic security services for electronic messaging
    applications:authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (usingdigital
    signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption). S/MIME can be used
    by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to addcryptographic security services to
    mail that is sent, and to interpretcryptographic security services in mail that
    is received. However,S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any
    transportmechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As such, S/MIMEtakes
    advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows securemessages to be
    exchanged in mixed-transport systems. Further, S/MIME can be used in automated
    message transfer agents thatuse cryptographic security services that do not require
    any humanintervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents andthe
    encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.</p>"
