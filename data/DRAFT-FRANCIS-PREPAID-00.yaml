abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Prepaid voice services have proven to be extremely successful.
    \ \nThere is a desire to replicate this success for data services. \nPrepaid for
    data presents new technical challenges, primarily due to  \nthe wide range of
    billing that may be applied to data services---\nvolume or time billing, differential
    billing by type of application \n(gaming, steaming, browsing, voice), billing
    by destination, and \neven billing of specific content.  Furthermore, a single
    data \nprepaid service may need to accomodate simultaneous network access \nby
    multiple devices (phone, laptop, PDA). \nThis paper discusses design issues for
    a protocol between a prepaid \napplication and the data network element.  It defines
    an \narchitecture and terminology.  It describes basic characteristics of \ndata
    prepaid service, as well as some advanced features.  It \nanalyzes the main technical
    issues, especially performance issues.  \nFinally, this paper describes the semantics
    of an illustrative \nprepaid data service protocol.  This document does not, however,
    \nspecify such a protocol.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
