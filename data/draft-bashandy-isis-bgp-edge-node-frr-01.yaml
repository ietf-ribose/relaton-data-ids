abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled betweenedge
    routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn knowabout a prefix P/m
    via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm. Ifthe edge router PEi crashes or becomes
    totally disconnected from thecore, it desirable for a core router \"P\" that is
    carrying traffic tothe failed edge router PEi to immediately restore traffic by
    re-routing packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the prefixP/m to
    one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj,until BGP re-converges.
    If the packets originally flowing to thefailed edge router PEi are labeled, then
    the repairing core router Prouter may need to swap, push, or pop the label advertised
    by thefailed edge router PEi with another label before re-routing thepacket through
    an LSP terminating PEj so that PEj can correctlyforward the packet. The document
    proposes an extension to IS-ISprotocol to inform core routers about the repair
    edge router PEj and,for labeled packets, the label that needs to be pushed/swapped
    beforesending the packet into the tunnel terminating on PEj</p>"
