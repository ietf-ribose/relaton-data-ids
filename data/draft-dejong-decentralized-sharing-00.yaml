abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft describes the steps and challenges of sharing documentsbetween
    persons, using internet-connected servers. We investigate thesituation where a
    document exists on a server to which the sender hasaccess through some software
    application, but the recipient(s) don't.All recipient(s) do, however, have access
    to software applications thatrun on least one other server.We discuss existing
    and proposed methods for the sender to initiate thecommunication, for each recipient
    to become aware of the sender's intentto share a document, for each recipient
    to access the document directly,for the document contents to be transmitted to
    server(s) to which therecipient(s) have access, for the sender to make and announce
    changes inthe document after it was initially sent, and for the recipient(s) tocommunicate
    comments and proposed changes to the document back to thesender.We also discuss
    how semantics of the document may be communicated,and how versioning conflicts
    may then in some cases be resolvedprogrammatically. Given that users of personal
    servers don't all runthe same compatible software on their server, the sending
    applicationneeds to discover which application-level protocols are supported by
    thereceiving application(s).</p>"
