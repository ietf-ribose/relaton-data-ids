abstract:
  content: "<p>In the DNS architecture, two kinds of record types for maintaininghost's
    IP addresses are supported: one is A type which records IPv4and AAAA for IPv6
    addresses. This document defines a new TYPE, whichis mainly used in queries in
    order to get both IPv4 and IPv6addresses. The main advantage is to avoid sending
    several requestsin order to resolve the location of a given resource. A singlerequest
    may be sufficient. The proposed solution does not requirethe definition of any
    new record type.</p>"
