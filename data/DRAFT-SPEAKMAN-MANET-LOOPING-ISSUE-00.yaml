abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the routing loop and packet looping issues
    in\nmobile ad hoc network (MANET) running proactive routing protocols\nusing hop
    count metric.\n\nMechanisms of loop formation are identified and how the problem
    of\nloop formation is exacerbated by the use of Link Layer Notification\nis described.
    \ The effect of the looping packets on the network are\nshown by comparing against
    the case where the looping packets are\ndetected and discarded, showing the need
    for routing loops or looping\npackets to be dealt with in MANETs.\n\t </p>\n      "
