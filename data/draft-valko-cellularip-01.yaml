abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagramsto
    a mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobilityand handoff support.
    It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to providewide area mobility support. Four
    fundamental design principles ofthe protocol are: (1) location information is
    stored in distributeddata bases (2) location information referring to a mobile
    host iscreated and updated by regular IP datagrams originated by the saidmobile
    host (3) location information is stored as soft state (4) location management
    for idle mobile hosts is separated from location management of hosts that are
    actively transmitting or receiving data.</p>"
