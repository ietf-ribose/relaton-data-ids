abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture
    thatis applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks andspecifies protocols
    for implementing it. This tunneling architectureis designed to facilitate scalability
    and reliability. A prominentfeature of it is to provide VPN tunnels over a connectionlessnetwork.
    Since a connectionless network can provide full meshconnectivity without a connection
    establishment procedure, thearchitecture enables scalable operation of a VPN more
    efficientlythan connection-oriented tunneling technologies.</p>"
