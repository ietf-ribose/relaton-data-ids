abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Public Switched Telephone Network includes several mechanisms\nthat
    increase the probability of completion for telephone calls made\nby authorised
    disaster relief personnel during emergencies such as\nhurricanes or terrorist
    attacks. This memo describes the security\nrequirements of providing this functionality
    in private and public IP\nnetworks, and how these requirements can be met using
    existing\nprotocols. It also specifies which enhancements are necessary to\nthese
    protocols to allow enhanced functionality such as roaming\naccess.\n\t </p>\n
