abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Making the Internet faster is the goal of many product and
    service\n   companies.  Many strategies exist, from data caching to packet\n   switching,
    performance improvements in Internet browser clients and\n   server software,
    without forgetting the transport network scaling\n   from the fiber core to the
    access edges.\n\n   This report investigates two proposed protocol enhancements
    aimed at\n   making the web browsing user experience better by optimizing the\n
    \  transport of web objects and thereby reducing the page load time.\n   The two
    enhancements are SPDY, a replacement of the HyperText\n   Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    requiring client and server changes, and a\n   TCP tune-up, an increase in the
    TCP initial congestion window\n   accomplished by a setting change on the web
    servers.  Both show\n   promise, but there are some caveats, particularly with
    SPDY.  SPDY is\n   a candidate for standardization as HTTP/2.0.\n\n   In addition
    to a discussion of the two enhancements, this report\n   provides the results
    of laboratory testing on SPDY version 2 and the\n   proposed increase in the TCP
    initial congestion window in a variety\n   of simulated conditions, comparing
    the page load time when using the\n   proposed enhancement to the page load time
    for the default case of\n   HTTPS and current initial congestion window settings.\n\n
    \  The proposed enhancements generate mixed results: web page load times\n   were
    reduced in some scenarios but increased significantly in others.\n   The performance
    improvement (or degradation) varied depending on the\n   number of servers, configuration
    of the initial TCP congestion\n   window, and especially any network packet loss.
    \ The following\n   results were obtained across all scenarios comparing SPDY
    and\n   congestion window enhancements to standard HTTPS.\n\n   o  Average reduction
    in page load time was 29%\n\n   o  Best improvement was over 78% reduction in
    page load time\n   o  Worst cases showed a negative impact, resulting in a 3.3x
    increase\n      in page load time\n\n   These results lead us to the following
    conclusions:\n\n   o  The SPDY protocol is currently a moving target, and thus
    it would\n      be challenging to realize a return on investment for general-\n
    \     purpose usage in web servers.\n\n   o  Protocol improvements, standardization
    in the IETF and wider\n      adoption by the client/server software may warrant
    a second look\n      at SPDY.\n\n   o  Some applications in controlled environments
    may gain by\n      leveraging SPDY.  SPDY might be a valuable tool where the a
    single\n      entity provides the servers, the client software, and the web\n
    \     content.\n\n   o  If SPDY were adopted very widely it may have some secondary\n
    \     benefits for network operators through improved infrastructure\n      scalability
    due to a significant reduction in concurrent TCP\n      sessions, as well as a
    reduction in Packets Per Second.\n\n   o  The proposed increase in the TCP initial
    congestion window is\n      straightforward, requires no client modifications,
    and on its own\n      provides consistent (albeit modest) performance gains.\n\n
    \  This report is available in a somewhat more detailed form in\n   [SPDY-ANALYSIS].\n\n\t
