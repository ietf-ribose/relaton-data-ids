abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This ID will contain the full-length versions of all critiques
    which\nwere not included in full in the RRG Report.  It may also point to\ndiscussions
    I consider significant, and include any \"rebuttals\" or\n\"reflections\" which
    were not included in full in the Report.  This ID\nis to support and document
    the IRTF Routing Research Group\ndiscussions concerning scalable routing, in early
    2010.  It is not a\nformal product of the RRG.  To what extent its contents are
    supported\nby RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.\n\t </p>\n
