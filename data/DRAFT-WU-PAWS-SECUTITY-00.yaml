abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PAWS is an access protocol between the Master device and the
    White\n   Space(WS) Database.  Master Devices connect to the white space\n   database
    directly using WS interface,but only authorized devices can\n   get the service
    from database.If an attacker can have full access to\n   the network medium between
    the master device and the database, the\n   attacker may deploy varieties of attacks
    on the network if there is\n   lack of security mechanism.\n\n   The present document
    describes the security threats to the current\n   framework of PAWS, and meanwhile
    proposes the corresponding\n   countermeasures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
