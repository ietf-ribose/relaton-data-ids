abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies SWAN, a stateless network protocol which
    uses \ndistributed control algorithms to deliver service differentiation in \nMANETs.
    SWAN uses rate control for UDP and TCP best-effort traffic, \nand source-based
    admission control for UDP real-time traffic. SWAN \nalso uses explicit congestion
    control notification (ECN) to dynamically \nregulate admitted real-time traffic
    in the face of network dynamics \nbrought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions.
    SWAN is designed \nto support real-time services over best effort MACs without
    the need to \ninstall and maintain costly QOS state at MANET nodes. This makes
    the SWAN approach to MANET QOS simple, scalable, and robust. The ns-2 simulation
    code is available from the web http://comet.columbia.edu/swan/).\n\t </p>\n      "
