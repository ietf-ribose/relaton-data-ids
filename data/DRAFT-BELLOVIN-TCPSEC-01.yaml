abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TCP-MD5 option is commonly used to secure BGP sessions
    between\n   routers, although it is known to have many serious deficiencies.\n
    \  This memo presents requirements for a TCP segment authentication\n   mechanism
    that is intended to replace TCP-MD5.  While TCP-MD5 was\n   designed to protect
    TCP sessions whose payload is BGP, the\n   applicability of the mechanism described
    herein is broader.  This\n   mechanism can be applied to any TCP connection, regardless
    of\n   payload.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
