abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve
    better\n   response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving\n
    \  the computing services towards the edge of the network in scenarios\n   of
    5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing), virtualized central office,\n   and others.
    \ Providing services by sharing computing resources from\n   multiple edges is
    emerging and becoming more and more useful for\n   computationally intensive tasks.
    \ The service nodes attached to\n   multiple edges normally have two key features,
    service equivalency\n   and service dynamism.  Ideally they should serve the service
    in a\n   computational balanced way.  However lots of approaches dispatch the\n
    \  service in a static way, e.g., to the geographically closest edge,\n   and
    they may cause unbalanced usage of computing resources at edges\n   which further
    degrades user experience and system utilization.  This\n   draft provides an overview
    of scenarios and problems associated.\n\n   Networking taking account of computing
    resource metrics as one of its\n   top parameters is called Compute First Networking
    (CFN) in this\n   document.  The document identifies several key areas which require\n
    \  more investigations in architecture and protocol to achieve the\n   balanced
    computing and networking resource utilization among edges in\n   CFN.\n\n\t </p>\n
