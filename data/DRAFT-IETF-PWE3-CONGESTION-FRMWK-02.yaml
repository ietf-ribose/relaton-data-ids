abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pseudowires are sometimes used to carry non-TCP data flows.  In
    these\ncircumstances the service payload will not react to network\ncongestion
    by reducing its offered load.  Pseudowires should\ntherefore reduces their network
    bandwidth demands in the face of\nsignificant packet loss, including if necessary
    completely ceasing\ntransmission.  Since it is difficult to determine a priori
    the number\nof equivalent TCP flow that a pseudowire represents, a suitably\n\"fair\"
    rate of back-off cannot be pre-determined.  This document\ndescribes pseudowire
    congestion problem and provides guidance on the\ndevelopment suitable solutions.\n\t
