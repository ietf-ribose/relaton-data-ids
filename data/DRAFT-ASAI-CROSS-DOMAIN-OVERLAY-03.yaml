abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Application-layer or overlay routing has been applied to various\n
    \  distributed systems such as content delivery networks and live media\n   streaming
    systems.  The problems with these systems for the layer 3\n   network providers,
    such as Internet service providers, are that these\n   systems utilize higher-cost
    network resources (e.g., transit links)\n   from the viewpoint of the layer 3
    network providers but the operators\n   have difficulties in controlling and optimizing
    the traffic of these\n   systems because these systems construct their own networks
    over the\n   layer 3 network.  The ALTO Working Group has worked on application-\n
    \  layer traffic optimization to fill the gaps in routing policies\n   between
    the layer 3 network and applications by providing the\n   underlay network topology
    and cost information to these systems.\n   However, there are considerations on
    applying application-layer\n   traffic optimization techniques to cross-domain
    traffic because the\n   cost is assumed to be configured by each AS although ASes
    are\n   autonomously operated.  This document summarizes general problems\n   with
    overlay networks and considerations on the AS-level application-\n   layer traffic
    optimization from the viewpoint of inter-AS economics.\n   The main concerns on
    the AS-level application-layer traffic\n   optimization are unfair policy configuration
    between distinct\n   administrative domains and asymmetric economic policies on
    transit\n   links.  The underlying problem inducing these concerns is that the\n
    \  economic policies between interconnected ASes are non-disclosure due\n   to
    commercial contracts.  This document also discusses the\n   conceivable approaches
    to solve the problems and considerations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
