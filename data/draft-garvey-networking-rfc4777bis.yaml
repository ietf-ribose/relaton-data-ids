abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the interface to the Telnet server on IBM's
    i Power Systems line of business computers. This interface allows Telnet clients
    to request a Telnet terminal or printer session using specific session attributes
    related to device names, password hash, language support, auto-sign-on, response
    codes, session association, etc. These support functions are implemented primarily
    using the Telnet Environment option negotiation RFC 1572 to define USERVAR variables
    that will be recognized by IBM i Telnet server. This obsoletes RFC4777 with an
    enhanced automatic sign-on a password hash and update on how non-complient 5250
    negotiations are handled.</p>"
