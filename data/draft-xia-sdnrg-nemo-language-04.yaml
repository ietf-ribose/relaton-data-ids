- content: "<p>The North-Bound Interface (NBI), located between the control plane
    and the applications, is essential to enable the application innovations and nourish
    the eco-system of SDN. While most of the NBIs are provided in the form of API,
    this document proposes the NEtwork MOdeling (NEMO) language which is intent based
    interface with novel language fashion. Concept, model and syntax are introduced
    in the document.</p>"
