abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The concept of \"make-before-break (MBB)\" while rerouting
    MPLS RSVP-TE\n   tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209].  In the procedure that is\n
    \  outlined, the behavior of downstream label assignment for the new LSP\n   (new
    tunnel instance) is not well defined.  As a general practice, a\n   different
    label is assigned by each downstream router and advertised\n   to the upstream
    router in the RESV message for the new LSP; this\n   results in a separate end-to-end
    data-plane path for the new LSP\n   (with the exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP
    with explicit label on the\n   last hop).  This practice allows independent end
    to end LSP path\n   data-plane verification for each tunnel instance.  The consequence
    of\n   this practice is that the label entry gets added/deleted in the LFIB\n
    \  at every non-ingress router along the LSP path during MBB.  Also, the\n   ingress
    router would need to update all the applications using this\n   LSP when switching
    to the new tunnel instance, as the new tunnel\n   instance uses different outgoing
    label.  This in turn may also cause\n   other elements of the network which are
    dependent on the LSP to do\n   the update.\n\n   Such network churn can be avoided/minimized
    if the same label can be\n   re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither
    the routing\n   functionalities nor the data path verification of each instance.
    \ In\n   addition, whenever label is reused, the setup time for the new tunnel\n
    \  instance would be faster because there is no need for the transit\n   routers
    along the path of the new LSP to wait for the new LFIB entry\n   to be added.
    \ This document proposes a set of procedures to\n   facilitate label reuse when
    there is a total or partial path overlap\n   between the two tunnel instances
    during MBB.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
