abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines three SIP extension header fields and associated
    option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the requester's preference
    for user-interface handling of that request. The first header, "Answer-Mode",
    expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface waits for
    user input before accepting the request or instead accepts the request without
    waiting on user input. The second header, "Priv-Answer-Mode" is similar to the
    second, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent
    additional authentication and authorization requirements. The third header, "Alert-Mode",
    expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface alerts the
    user about the request. These behaviors have applicability to applications such
    as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics like loop-back. This document also defines
    use of the SIP extension header field "Answer-Mode" in a response to an INVITE
    request to inform the requester as to which answer mode was actually applied to
    this request. There are significant security considerations, especially when an
    answering mode option is used in conjunction with an alerting mode option.</p>
