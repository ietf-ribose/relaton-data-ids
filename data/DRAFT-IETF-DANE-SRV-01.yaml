abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DANE specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA
    resource\n   records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS\n
    \  certificate.  The association is secured with DNSSEC.  Some\n   application
    protocols can use SRV records [RFC2782] to indirectly\n   name the server hosts
    for a service domain.  (SMTP uses MX records\n   for the same purpose.)  This
    specification gives generic instructions\n   for how these application protocols
    locate and use TLSA records.\n   Separate documents give the details that are
    specific to particular\n   application protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
