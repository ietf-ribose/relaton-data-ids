abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as
    defined\n   in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-\n
    \  session replay attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,\n   the
    existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP\n   header.
    \ This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of\n   attacks.\n\n
    \  This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number\n   mechanism
    that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-\n   session replay
    attacks when its using manual keys for securing its\n   protocol packets.  Additionally,
    we also describe some changes in the\n   cryptographic hash computation so that
    we eliminate most attacks that\n   result because OSPFv2 does not protect the
    IP header.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
