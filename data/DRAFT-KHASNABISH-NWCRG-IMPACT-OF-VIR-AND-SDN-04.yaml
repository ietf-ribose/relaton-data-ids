abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Coding is a technique used to code packets and be able
    to\n   recover coded packets from loses.  It requires at least two\n   participating
    nodes in the path of the packet, one to encode and\n   another to decode.  This
    document discusses the impact of\n   virtualization and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) on the emerging\n   network coding.  This document also discusses the integration
    of\n   network coding in various layers of the network stack and the APIs\n   required
    from the network coding entity to program it from a\n   controller.\n\n\t </p>\n
