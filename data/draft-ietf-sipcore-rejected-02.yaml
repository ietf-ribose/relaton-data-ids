abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code. This response
    code enables calling parties to learn an intermediary rejected their call attempt.
    The call will not be answered. As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that future
    attempts to contact the same UAS will likely fail. The present use case driving
    the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine.
    In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process. This contrasts with
    the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code, which a human at the target UAS indicated
    the call was not wanted. In some jurisdictions this distinction is important.
    This document defines the use of the Call-Info header in 608 responses to enable
    rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error.</p>"
