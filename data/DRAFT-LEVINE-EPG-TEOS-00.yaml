abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Trusted Email Open Standard (TEOS) is a multi-level\n   identity
    system for SMTP e-mail.  It uses signatures to\n   authenticate the identity of
    the sender of a message, and\n   further permits the secure transmission of assertions
    about\n   each message including the type of message, third-party\n   certifications,
    and graphical trust marks.\n\t </p>\n      "
