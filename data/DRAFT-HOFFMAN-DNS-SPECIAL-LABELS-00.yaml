abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an new IANA registry for special labels
    in the\n   DNS.  The registry is useful because the labels cause special\n   handling
    in DNS entities such as stub resolvers, recursive resolvers,\n   and applications
    that use DNS, and developers of software for those\n   entities should be aware
    of the many types of special labels in use.\n\n   [[ A GitHub repo for this document
    is at\n   https://github.com/paulehoffman/dns-special-labels ]]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
