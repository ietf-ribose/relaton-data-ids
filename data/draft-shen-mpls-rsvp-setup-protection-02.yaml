abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for
    protecting established LSPs against link and node failures. This document extends
    the mechanism to provide so-called "setup protection" for LSPs during their initial
    Path message signaling time. In particular, it enables a router to reroute an
    LSP via an existing bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate downstream
    link or node along the desired path. Therefore, it can be used to reduce LSP setup
    time in such a situation, or allow LSPs with strict paths to be established successfully
    when alternative paths are unavailable in the network or unable to be computed
    by ingress.</p>
