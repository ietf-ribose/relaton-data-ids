abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote access over the internet and IP mobility are currently being
    addressed as two separate problems. The L2TP specification is defining a protocol,
    or rather a tunnel control mechanism to solve the remote access problem. On the
    other hand, the Mobile IP working group has been solving the mobility problem.
    Nevertheless, the same solution applies to both problems, namely, tunneling. This
    document defines a Tunnel Set-up Protocol (TSP) that solves both problems using
    a common approach. TSP is heavily based on the control messages defined by Mobile
    IP.</p>"
