abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for\n
    \  performances of provisioning Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in\n   Generalized
    MPLS or MPLS-TE networks.\n\n   When Generalized MPLS/MPLS-TE is used to provision
    LSPs, it is useful\n   to record the performance of the provisioning process,
    such as the\n   delay in creating and deleting the LSPs.  The managed information
    may\n   be retrieved by the Management System and visualized on the GUI, so\n
    \  that the performance of dynamic provisioning may be monitored in a\n   timely
    manner.\n\n   This work is a continuation of the work in [RFC5814] and\n   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dpm],
    where the provisioning performance values are\n   obtained through active measurements.\n\n\t
