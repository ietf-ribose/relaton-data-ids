abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an architectural framework for mobility
    \nmanagement (MM) in general with an emphasis on localized mobility \nmanagement
    (LMM). MM requires new architectural entities to be added \nto the Internet Protocol
    version 4 and version 6. Also the \navailability of mobility management must be
    advertised by these \nentities extending ICMPv4 and v6. The document identifies
    these \nentities as routing proxies (RP) and defines abstractly the behaviour
    \nof RPs and their interactions with the existing entities and the \nrouter/agent
    advertisements that RP needs to issue in order to let \nits presence known. Basic
    architecture can be optimized by either \ninforming the end nodes in order to
    achieve route optimization and/ \nor by localizing mobility management. LMM itself
    requires new \nentities identified as localized routing proxies or localized \nmobility
    agents (LMA) to be introduced to the basic architectures of \nmobility management.
    The behaviour of LMA is abstractly defined. The \ndocument also identifies a number
    of open issues whose resolution is \ncrucial to the standardization of LMM protocols.
