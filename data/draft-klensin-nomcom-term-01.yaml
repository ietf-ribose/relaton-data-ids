abstract:
  content: "<p>A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure inleadership
    roles is not in the best interests of the community.While, in theory, that advice
    could simply be given to the NomCom,there is reason to believe that a different
    model for considerationof renewal or replacement for members of the leadership
    would be moreefficient for the NomCom and would impose less hardship on incumbentsand
    the community. This document outlines that alternate method.</p>"
