abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents to send and receive candidates
    incrementally rather than exchanging complete lists. With such incremental provisioning,
    ICE agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still gathering candidates
    and considerably shorten the time necessary for ICE processing to complete. The
    above mechanism is also referred to as "trickle ICE".</p>
