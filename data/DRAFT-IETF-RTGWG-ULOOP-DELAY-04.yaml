abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing
    protocols\n   to prevent local transient forwarding loops in case of link failure.\n
    \  This mechanism proposes a two-steps convergence by introducing a\n   delay
    between the convergence of the node adjacent to the topology\n   change and the
    network wide convergence.\n\n   As this mechanism delays the IGP convergence it
    may only be used for\n   planned maintenance or when fast reroute protects the
    traffic between\n   the link failure time and the IGP convergence.\n\n   The proposed
    mechanism will be limited to the link down event in\n   order to keep simplicity.\n\n
    \  Simulations using real network topologies have been performed and\n   show
    that local loops are a significant portion (&gt;50%) of the total\n   forwarding
    loops.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
