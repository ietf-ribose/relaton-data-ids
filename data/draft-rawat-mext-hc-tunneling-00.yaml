abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IP tunneling mechanisms have important applications in networksolutions
    and are widely used in numerous contexts such as security(VPN), IPv4 to IPv6 transition,
    and mobility support (MobileIP andNEMO). However, these tunneling mechanisms induce
    a large overheadresulting from adding several protocol headers in each packet.
    Thisoverhead deteriorates performance on wireless links which are scarcein resources.Header
    compression methods are often used on connection orientedcommunication (e.g.,
    UMTS networks) to reduce the overhead on thewireless part. These header compression
    methods can be used ontunnel headers to reduce the protocol header overheads,
    independentof the payload type. Although, several header compression methodsexist,
    the header compression profiles defined by them are notadapted to the characteristics
    of IP tunneling. This documentspecifies a tunneling header compression protocol
    for IP tunnelingmechanisms.</p>"
