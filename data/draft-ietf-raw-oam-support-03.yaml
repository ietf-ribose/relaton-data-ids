abstract:
- content: "<p>Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure. However,
    wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth of several orders of magnitude lower than
    wired networks. Besides, wireless transmissions are lossy by nature; the probability
    that a packet cannot be decoded correctly by the receiver may be quite high. In
    these conditions, providing high reliability and a low delay is challenging. This
    document lists the requirements of the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) features are recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
    on top of a collection of wireless segments. This document describes the benefits,
    problems, and trade- offs for using OAM in wireless networks to achieve Service
    Level Objectives (SLO).</p>"
