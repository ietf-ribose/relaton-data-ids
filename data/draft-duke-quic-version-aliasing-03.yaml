abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its future extensibility
    partly by specifying its version number. There will be a relatively small number
    of published version numbers for the foreseeable future. This document provides
    a method for clients and servers to negotiate the use of other version numbers
    in subsequent connections and encrypts Initial Packets using secret keys instead
    of standard ones. If a sizeable subset of QUIC connections use this mechanism,
    this should prevent middlebox ossification around the current set of published
    version numbers and the contents of QUIC Initial packets, as well as improving
    the protocol's privacy properties.</p>"
