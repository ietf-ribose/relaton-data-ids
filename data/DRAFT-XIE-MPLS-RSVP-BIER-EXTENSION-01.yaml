abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture
    that\n   provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate\n
    \  routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific\n   BIER
    header.  This document describes extensions to Resource\n   Reservation Protocol
    - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the set up\n   of Traffic Engineered (TE)
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched\n   Paths (LSPs) with BIER infomation,
    which is called P2MP based BIER in\n   [I-D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].\n\n\n\t
