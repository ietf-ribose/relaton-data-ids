abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of
    the\n   Real-time Transport Protocol that can provide confidentiality,\n   message
    authentication, and replay protection to the RTP traffic and\n   to the control
    traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control\n   Protocol (RTCP).  This document
    describes a method of using DTLS key\n   management for SRTP by using a new extension
    that indicates that SRTP\n   is to be used for data protection, and which establishes
    SRTP keys.\n\t </p>\n      "
