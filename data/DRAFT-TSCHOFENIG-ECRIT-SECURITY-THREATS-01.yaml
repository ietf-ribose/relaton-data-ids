abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the increasing interest to replace parts of the public
    switched\n   telephone network (PSTN) with the IP-based network, the  core\n   functionality
    of PSTN such as emergency services, has to be offered\n   when using IP-based
    technologies.  Since the PSTN and the Internet\n   follow different design principles
    their architecture is quite\n   different.  This fact has to be considered and
    security threats for\n   an IP-based emergency environment have to be re-evaluated.
    \ This\n   document investigates the potential threats against the IP based\n
    \  emergency architecture.  It focuses on some analysis of threats for\n   both
    the end hosts and the infrastructure that aims to support\n   emergency services.\n\t
