abstract:
  content: "<p>As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to wireless
    endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned between wired and
    wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default. This document
    specifies a set of Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User
    Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the
    IETF and the IEEE so as to maintain consistent QoS treatment between wired and
    IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.</p>"
