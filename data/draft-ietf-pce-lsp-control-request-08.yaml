abstract:
  content: "<p>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about
    the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs). When a PCE has stateful control over LSPs it may send
    indications to LSP head-ends to modify the attributes (especially the paths) of
    the LSPs. A Path Computation Client (PCC) has set up LSPs under local configuration
    may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE. There are use-cases in which
    a stateful PCE may wish to obtain control of locally configured LSPs of which
    it is aware but that have not been delegated to the PCE. This document describes
    an extension to the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) to
    enable a PCE to make such requests.</p>"
