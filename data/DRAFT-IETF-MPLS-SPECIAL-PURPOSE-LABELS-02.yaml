abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.
    \ A block\n   of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly\n
    \  called \"reserved labels\".  They will be called \"special purpose\n   labels\"
    in this document.  As there are only 16 of these labels,\n   caution is needed
    in the allocation of new special purpose labels,\n   yet at the same time allow
    forward progress when one is called for.\n   This memo defines some procedures
    to follow in the allocation and\n   retirement of special purpose labels, as well
    as a method to extend\n   the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo
    renames the IANA\n   registry for these labels to \"Special Purpose MPLS Label
    Values\", and\n   creates a new one called the \"Extended Special Purpose MPLS
    Label\n   Values\" registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
