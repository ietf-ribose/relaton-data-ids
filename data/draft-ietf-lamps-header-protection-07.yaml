abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME version 3.1 has introduced a feasible standardized option to
    accomplish Header Protection. However, few implementations generate messages using
    this structure, and several legacy and non-legacy implementations have revealed
    rendering issues at the receiving side. Clearer specifications regarding message
    processing, particularly with respect to header sections, are needed in order
    to resolve these rendering issues. Some mail user agents are also sending and
    receiving cryptographically-protected message headers using a different structure.
    In order to help implementers to correctly compose and render email messages with
    Header Protection, this document updates S/MIME Header Protection specifications
    with additional guidance on MIME format, sender and receiver processing.</p>"
