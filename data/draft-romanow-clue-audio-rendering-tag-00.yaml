abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is for discussion in the CLUE working group.
    It proposes adding an audio rendering tag to the CLUE framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework],
    which makes it possible for the consumer to correctly render audio with respect
    to video in a multistream video conference. The solution proposed is in partial
    response to CLUE Task #10, Does Framework provide sufficient info for receiver?</p>"
