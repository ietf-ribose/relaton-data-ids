abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale
    and\n   complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage\n
    \  and configure the network. Deploying policy or configuration based on\n   an
    abstract view of the underlying network is much better than\n   manipulating each
    individual network element, however, in this case,\n   the policy and configuration
    cannot be recognized by the network\n   elements. This document describes guidelines
    for mapping\n   configuration and policy into device-level configuration and the
    way\n   in which such SUPA models will be processed by software to produce\n   configuration
    details for actual devices. The SUPA framework overview\n   and primary procedures
    of mapping are proposed. Moreover, an\n   exemplary mapping scenario is provided
    to illustrate the mechanism\n   involved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
