abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms\n
    \  which enable a proof-of-possession-based authentication scheme and\n   are
    meant to be used for quick re-authentication of a previous\n   session.  The Hashed
    Token SASL mechanism's authentication sequence\n   consists of only one round-trip.
    \ The usage of short-lived,\n   exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens is achieving
    the single round-\n   trip property.  The SASL mechanism specified herin further
    provides\n   hash agility, mutual authentication and is secured by channel\n   binding.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
