abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a methodology for measuring sustained TCP
    \nthroughput performance in an end-to-end managed network environment.  \nThis
    memo is intended to provide a practical approach to help users \nvalidate the
    TCP layer performance of a managed network, which should \nprovide a better indication
    of end-user application level experience.  \nIn the methodology, various TCP and
    network parameters are identified \nthat should be tested as part of the network
    verification at the TCP \nlayer.\n\t </p>\n      "
