abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between MVPN
    Source Active routes and customer MSDP Source Active routes, which is useful for
    MVPN provider networks offering services to customers with an existing MSDP infrastructure.
    Without the procedures described in this document, VPN-specific MSDP sessions
    are required among the PEs that are customer MSDP peers.</p>"
