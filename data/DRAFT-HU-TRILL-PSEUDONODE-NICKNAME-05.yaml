abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RBridges provide provide end-station services to their attached
    end\n   stations.  To avoid potential frame duplication and loops, the rule\n
    \  that only one edge RBridge is allowed to be the frame forwarder of a\n   VLAN
    on a shared LAN segment is employed by base TRILL protocol, even\n   though there
    are multiple RBridges attached to that segment.\n   However, in some application
    scenarios, for example an end station is\n   multi-homed to multiple RBridges,
    there is a need to improve the\n   resiliency and increase the available network
    bandwidth of the\n   connection.  This means all those RBriges attached to the
    end station\n   can act as the frame forwarders of a specific VLAN.  This kind
    of\n   active-active connection violates the above rule.  The violation may\n
    \  bring some additional problems, such as the flip-flopping of the\n   nickname-MAC
    correspondences for such end stations in remote\n   RBridges' forwarding tables,
    frame dropping because of failure of\n   Reverse Path Forwarding Check(RPF Check)
    on RBridges, etc.  The RPF\n   Check problem has been addressed in [CMT].  This
    document proposes\n   the concept of Virtual RBridge, along with the pseudo-nickname\n
    \  configuration for this Virtual RBridge, to address the above problems\n   in
    accompany with [CMT].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
