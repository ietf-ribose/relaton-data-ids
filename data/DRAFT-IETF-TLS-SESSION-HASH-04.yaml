abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) master secret is not\n   cryptographically
    bound to important session parameters such as the\n   server certificate.  Consequently,
    it is possible for an active\n   attacker to set up two sessions, one with a client
    and another with a\n   server, such that the master secrets on the two sessions
    are the\n   same.  Thereafter, any mechanism that relies on the master secret
    for\n   authentication, including session resumption, becomes vulnerable to a\n
    \  man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can simply forward\n   messages
    back and forth between the client and server.  This\n   specification defines
    a TLS extension that contextually binds the\n   master secret to a log of the
    full handshake that computes it, thus\n   preventing such attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n
