abstract:
- content: "<p>In the early days of the Arpanet, each specification contained its
    own definition of ABNF. This included the email specifications, RFC733 and then
    RFC822 which have come to be the common citations for defining ABNF. The current
    document separates out that definition, to permit selective reference. Predictably,
    it also provides some modifications and enhancements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
