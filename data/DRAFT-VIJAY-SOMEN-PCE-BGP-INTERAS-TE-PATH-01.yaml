abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ability to compute an optimal path for setting up Traffic
    \n   engineering Label Switched Paths spanning multiple autonomous \n   systems
    managed by different operators has been a key requirement in \n   MPLS and GMPLS
    networks. This document specifies a method of \n   computing inter-AS paths consisting
    of a list of ASes to be \n   traversed and a list of TE-Tunnels to be traversed
    in each AS. The \n   method described here uses BGP speakers in the PCEs of each
    AS to \n   distribute the inter-AS connectivity information and the TE-Tunnels
    \n   in each AS to its neighbors to facilitate the construction of an \n   inter-AS
    topology graph which can be used for computing inter-AS\n    paths. \n\n\t </p>\n
