abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TLS protocol provides authentication and data protection for \ncommunication
    between two entities. However, missing from the \nprotocol is a way to perform
    non-repudiation service.  \n\n \n \n This document defines extensions to the TLS
    protocol to allow it to \nperform non-repudiation service. It is based on [TLSSIGN]
    and it \nprovides the client and the server the ability to sign by TLS, \nhandshake
    and applications data using certificates such as X.509.\n\t </p>\n      "
