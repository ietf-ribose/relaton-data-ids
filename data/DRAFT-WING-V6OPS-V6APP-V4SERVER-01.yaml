abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When an application runs on a host or network that only supports
    IPv6\n(\"IPv6-only\"), it is sometimes necessary that the application\ncommunicate
    with IPv4 peers.  When that communication involves DNS,\nDNS64 and a 6/4 translator
    works well without any changes to most\napplications.  However, when that communication
    does not involve DNS,\nit can require additional features be configured on or
    programmed\ninto the IPv6 application.  This document explains why this\nfunctionality
    is important and describes mechanisms for applications\nto provide such functionality.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
