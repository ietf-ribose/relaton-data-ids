abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a TCP Option called EchoCookie.  It
    provides\n   a single field that a TCP server can use to store opaque cookie data\n
    \  'in flight' rather than in memory.  As new TCP options are defined,\n   they
    can require that implementations support the EchoCookie option.\n   Then if a
    server's SYN queue is under pressure from a SYN flooding\n   attack, it can ask
    clients to echo its connection state in their\n   acknowledgement.  This facility
    is similar to the classic SYN Cookie,\n   but it provides enough space for connection
    state associated with TCP\n   options.  In contrast, the classic location for
    a SYN Cookie only\n   provides enough space for a degraded encoding of the Maximum
    Segment\n   Size (MSS) TCP option and no others.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
