abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\nfunctions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\nSwitching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\nAn important application of MPLS and GMPLS
    networks is Virtual\nPrivate Networks (VPNs) that may be constructed using Label
    Switched\nPaths (LSPs) in the MPLS and GMPLS networks as VPN tunnels. PCE may\nbe
    applied as a tool to compute the paths of such tunnels in order to\nachieve better
    use of the network resources and to provide better\nlevels of service to the VPN
    customers.\n\nGeneric requirements for a communication protocol between Path\nComputation
    Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in \"Path\nComputation Element (PCE) Communication
    Protocol Generic\nRequirements\". This document complements the generic requirements
    and\npresents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol\nrequirements that
    are specific to the application of PCE to VPNs.\n\t </p>\n      "
