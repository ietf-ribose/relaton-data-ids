abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) describes
    complex\n    business forms for use over the Internet. The objective of the UFDL\n
    \   is to enable the creation of cross-platform Internet business forms\n    that
    (1) contain both the complex logic and precise layout that\n    administrators
    require, (2) are simple to maintain and distribute,\n    and (3) integrate easily
    with existing business systems. As more\n    and more business is done over the
    Internet, the need for a form\n    description language that incorporates these
    features grows. HTML\n    is designed for Internet pages, and is severely limited
    as a form\n    language. This document specifies the vocabulary, syntax, and\n
    \   meaning of the UFDL.\n\t </p>\n      "
