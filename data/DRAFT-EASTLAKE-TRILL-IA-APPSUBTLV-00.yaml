abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots\n   of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by
    a\n   TRILL switch sets of addresses such that all of the addresses in each\n
    \  set designate the same interface (port). For example, an EUI-48 MAC\n   (Extended
    Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control) address,\n   IPv4 address, and
    IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding\n   to the same interface. Such
    information could be used, for example,\n   to synthesize responses to or by-pass
    the need for the Address\n   Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    (ND) protocol,\n   of the flooding of unknown MAC addresses, in some cases.\n\n\n\n\t
