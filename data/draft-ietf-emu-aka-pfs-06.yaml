abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations associated
    with pervasive surveillance. Some of the reported attacks involved compromising
    smart cards, such as attacking SIM card manufacturers and operators in an effort
    to compromise shared secrets stored on these cards. Since the publication of those
    reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes have gained much scrutiny and
    have improved. However, the danger of resourceful attackers for these systems
    is still a concern. This specification is an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'
    authentication method which was defined in [RFC9048]. The extension, when negotiated,
    provides Forward Secrecy for the session key generated as a part of the authentication
    run in EAP-AKA'. This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term
    pre- shared secret in a SIM card from being able to decrypt any past communications.
    In addition, if the attacker stays merely a passive eavesdropper, the extension
    prevents attacks against future sessions. This forces attackers to use active
    attacks instead.</p>"
