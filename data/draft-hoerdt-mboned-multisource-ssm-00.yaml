abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Classical multicast multi-sources applications use the Deering's
    [1]ASM group communication model where anyone, including non-members,can send
    packets with one local operation to a group identifier Gwith best effort guarantees
    that its packet will be transmitted toall group members: the network duplicates
    packets and manages thedynamics of source and receivers. With the new Holbrook's
    [3] SSMmodel it is the responsibility of applications to tell the networkwho are
    their sources of interest. As a consequence, the SSM modelis well suited for TV-like
    (one to many) applications because thereis only one source to discover and it's
    supposed to be well known.But there is still missing an SSM session layer or middleware
    forapplications helping multi-sources applications to discover thepresence/leaving
    source in case of SSM model. We give here apossible implementation for this Source
    discovery session layeraccording to the protocol defined in [5].</p>"
