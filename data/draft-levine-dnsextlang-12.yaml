abstract:
- content: "<p>Adding new RRTYPEs to the DNS has required that DNS servers and provisioning
    software be upgraded to support each new RRTYPE in Master files. This document
    defines a DNS extension language intended to allow most new RRTYPEs to be supported
    by adding entries to configuration data read by the DNS software, with no software
    changes needed for each RRTYPE.</p>"
