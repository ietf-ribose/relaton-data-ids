abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps
    that\n   are incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as packet\n
    \  timestamps for short.  This document specifies guidelines for\n   defining
    packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various\n   layers.  It also
    presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The\n   target audience of this
    memo includes network protocol designers.  It\n   is expected that a new network
    protocol that requires a packet\n   timestamp will, in most cases, use one of
    the recommended timestamp\n   formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits
    the protocol\n   requirements, the new protocol specification should specify the\n
    \  format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this\n   document.\n\n
    \  The rationale behind defining a relatively small set of recommended\n   formats
    is that it enables significant reuse; network protocols can\n   typically reuse
    the timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol\n   (NTP) or the Precision Time
    Protocol (PTP), allowing a\n   straightforward integration with an NTP or a PTP-based
    timer.\n   Moreover, since accurate timestamping mechanisms are often\n   implemented
    in hardware, a new network protocol that reuses an\n   existing timestamp format
    can be quickly deployed using existing\n   hardware timestamping capabilities.\n\n\t
