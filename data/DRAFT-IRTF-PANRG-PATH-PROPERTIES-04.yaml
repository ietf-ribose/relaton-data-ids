abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path properties express information about paths across a network
    and\n   the services provided via such paths.  In a path-aware network, path\n
    \  properties may be fully or partially available to entities such as\n   hosts.
    \ This document defines and categorizes path properties.\n   Furthermore, the
    document specifies several path properties which\n   might be useful to hosts
    or other entities, e.g., for selecting\n   between paths or for invoking some
    of the provided services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
