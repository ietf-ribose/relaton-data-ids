abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a protocol for sending DNS messages over
    the\n   DTLS-Secured Constrained Application Protocol (CoAPS).  Using the\n   REST
    architecture specified in CoAP and the security features of\n   DTLS, DNS over
    CoAPS provides encrypted DNS messages for constrained\n   devices in the Internet
    of Things (IoT) based on common interfaces.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note
    is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document
    takes place on TODO\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found
