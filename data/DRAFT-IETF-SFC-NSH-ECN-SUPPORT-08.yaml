abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit congestion notification (ECN) allows a forwarding
    element to\n   notify downstream devices of the onset of congestion without having\n
    \  to drop packets. Coupled with a means to feed information about\n   congestion
    back to upstream nodes, this can improve network\n   efficiency through better
    congestion control, frequently without\n   packet drops. This document specifies
    ECN and congestion feedback\n   support within a Service Function Chaining (SFC)
    domain through use\n   of the Network Service Header (NSH, RFC 8300) and IP Flow
    Information\n   Export (IPFIX, RFC 7011).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
