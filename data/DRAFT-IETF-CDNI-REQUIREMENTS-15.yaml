abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content delivery is frequently provided by specifically architected\n
    \  and provisioned Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).  As a result of\n   significant
    growth in content delivered over IP networks, existing\n   CDN providers are scaling
    up their infrastructure.  Many Network\n   Service Providers and Enterprise Service
    Providers are also deploying\n   their own CDNs.  To deliver contents from the
    Content Service\n   Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across\n
    \  multiple CDNs.  This creates a need for interconnecting (previously)\n   standalone
    CDNs so that they can collectively act as a single\n   delivery platform from
    the CSP to the end users.\n\n   The goal of the present document is to outline
    the requirements for\n   the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI
    working\n   group.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
