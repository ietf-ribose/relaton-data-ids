abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices
    in 5G\n   mobile systems to transport slices in IP, Layer 2 and Layer 1\n   transport
    networks.  Slices in 5G systems are characterized by\n   latency bounds, reservation
    guarantees, jitter, data rates,\n   availability, mobility speed, usage density,
    criticality and\n   priority.  These characteristics should be mapped to the transport\n
    \  network slice characteristics that include bandwidth, latency and\n   criteria
    such as isolation, directionality and disjoint routes.\n   Mobile slice criteria
    need to be mapped to the appropriate transport\n   slice and capabilities offered
    in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul\n   connectivity segments between radio side
    network functions and user\n   plane function(gateway).\n\n   This document describes
    how mobile network functions map its slice\n   criteria to identifiers in IP and
    Layer 2 packets that transport\n   network segments use to grant transport layer
    services during UE\n   mobility scenarios.  Applicability of this framework and
    underlying\n   transport networks, which can enable different slice properties
    are\n   also discussed.  This is based on mapping between mobile and\n   transport
    underlays (L2, Segment Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
