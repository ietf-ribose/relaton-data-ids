abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses some issues surrounding ingress filtering by IPs,
    site multihoming, and source address selection. The problem is that in a site
    which has prefixes from multiple ISPs, the source address selected by a host might
    be inconsistent with the egress ISP for a particular destination address. If the
    ISP deploys source- address-based ingress filtering, the host will be unable to
    communicate with the destination. The draft proposes some possible approaches
    towards a solution.</p>"
