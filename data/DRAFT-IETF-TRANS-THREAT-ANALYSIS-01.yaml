abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an attack model for the Web PKI context
    in\n   which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site\n   certificates
    will be developed. The model provides an analysis of\n   detection and remediation
    mechanisms for both syntactic and semantic\n   mis-issuance. The model introduces
    an outline of attacks to organize\n   the discussion. The model also describes
    the roles played by the\n   elements of the Certificate Transparency (CT) system,
    to establish a\n   context for the model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
