abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    manipulate configuration datastores. However, client applications often need to
    be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that
    may impact management applications. Standard mechanisms are needed to support
    the monitoring of the base system events within the NETCONF server. This document
    defines a YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for
    some common system events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
