abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol,
    RFC-2543[3]. The extension adds the PROPOSE method to theSIP protocol. The intend
    of the PROPOSE method is to allow a MediaGateway or other types of server that
    is serving a SIP node in alive session to propose a revised session setting to
    the node due tochanges in network or other constraints of the current session.
    Anexample of revised session setting could be a suggestion to the nodeto lower
    its quality of service or choose a lower bandwidth codecdue to an increase in
    network traffic.</p>"
