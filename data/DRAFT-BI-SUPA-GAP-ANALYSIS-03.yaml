abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n
    \  applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing
    business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of
    new services. New automation paradigms are meant\n   to help reach these goals,
    including the optimization of network\n   functions through application control.
    This control could be signaled\n   directly by an application, through a proxy
    or orchestrated in a\n   centralized manner. The purpose of SUPA is to develop
    a methodology\n   by which network services can be managed using standardized
    policy\n   rules. SUPA will focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter traffic\n
    \  management as part of the distributed data center use case, including\n   the
    automated provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks\n   of various
    types.This memo analyses the current state of the art of\n   the industries in
    IETF and outside IETF.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
