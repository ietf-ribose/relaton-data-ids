abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP relies in communication peers to implement congestion control
    by\n   hosts voluntary limiting their own data rate. Nevertheless this\n   assumption
    introduces unsolved DoS attack opportunities.\n\n   A DoS attack can be easily
    performed by a host that acknowledges TCP\n   segments not yet received (maybe
    even not sent).\n\n   This document presents and briefly describes the problem,
    already\n   identified and pointed before, but also shows than it can be easily\n
    \  performed (with very interesting results) and proposes some\n   server-side
    modifications to TCP stack in order to make this attack\n   more dificult to perform.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
