abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture,
    which\nmakes the combination of P2P and SIP practical.  In this\narchitecture,
    heterogeneous overlays are inter-connected via a\ndecentralized manner provided
    by the hierarchical P2P-SIP\narchitecture.  The overhead of the session control
    process is reduced\nsince the P2P overlay is used by SIP as the underlying peer
    locating\napproach.  Some nodes in the overlay are proposed to be stateful to\nimprove
    the reliability of the overlay.  Finally, a session initial\nexample is presented
    to illustrate this architecture.This work is\nbeing discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu
    mailing list.\n\t </p>\n      "
