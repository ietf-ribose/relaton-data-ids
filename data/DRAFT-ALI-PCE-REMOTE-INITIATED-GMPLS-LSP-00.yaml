abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful
    PCE Model\n     draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies\n     procedures
    that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-\n     initiated LSPs under
    the active stateful PCE model. However, this\n     specification is focused on
    MPLS networks, and does not cover\n     remote instantiation of GMPLS paths.  This
    document complements\n     PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful
    PCE Model\n     draft by addressing the extensions required for GMPLS applications,\n
    \    for example for OTN and WSON networks.\n\n     When active stateful PCE is
    used for managing PCE-initiated LSP,\n     PCC may not be aware of the intended
    usage of the LSP (e.g., in a\n     multi-layer network). PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated
    LSP Setup\n     in a Stateful PCE Model draft does not address this requirement.\n
    \    This draft also addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC\n     should
    use the PCEP initiated LSPs.\n\n\n     \n\t </p>\n      "
