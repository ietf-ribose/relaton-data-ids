abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are many requirements of developing internationalized and
    \nhuman-readable Internet identifiers/names now, thereby there are many \nsystems
    based on DNS technology to meet such requirements. John C. \nKlensin has proposed
    a three-layer search-based access model for the DNS \n[DNSSEARCH]; this paper
    is only to explain some related problems \nmentioned in John C. Klensin's proposal.
    Especially it focuses on \nTraditional and Simplified Chinese problems and some
    other special \nChinese requirements. \n\nThe ultimate goal for any kinds of search-based
    access system is to help \nusers to access network resources in more natural ways,
    which have \ndifferent meaning for different user groups. On the premise of respecting
    Chinese user's language convention, it is very important for a valuable and human-friendly
    system to deal with traditional and simplified Chinese equivalence problems.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
