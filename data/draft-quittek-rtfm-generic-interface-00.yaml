abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo specifies a high-level application-oriented interface tothe
    Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) Architecture. Theabstract interface models
    the RTFM architecture while hiding many ofthe details not relevant to an application
    programmer who want tointegrate IP traffic measurements into an application. Particularlythe
    interaction between manager, reader, and meter is hidden by theinterface, and
    rule sets used for traffic measurement specificationare replaced by simpler data
    structures. Furthermore, the RTFMinterface supports complex actions like modifying
    a trafficmeasurement specification while it is already being applied. Theinterface
    is defined in an abstract way. It can be implemented by anapplication programming
    interface as well as by a network protocol.</p>"
