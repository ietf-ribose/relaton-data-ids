abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes those features of a service which processes\nsigned
    documents which must be present in order for that service to\nconstitute a 'technical
    non-repudiation' service.  A technical\nnon-repudiation service must permit an
    independent verifier to\ndetermine whether a given signature was applied to a
    given data\nobject by the private key associated with a given valid certificate,\nat
    a time later than the signature.  The features of a technical non-\nrepudiation
    service are expected to be necessary for a full non-\nrepudiation service, although
    they may not be sufficient.\nThis document is intended to clarify the definition
    of the\n'non-repudiation' service in RFC 2459.  It should thus serve as a\nguide
    to when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should\nbe set and to
    when a Certificate Authority is required to archive\nCRL's.\n\t </p>\n      "
