abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the limitations of TCP is that it has limited space
    for TCP\n   options, only 40 bytes.  Many mechanisms have been proposed for for\n
    \  extending the TCP option space, but the biggest challenge has been to\n   get
    additional option space in the initial SYN packet.\n\n   This memo presents a
    optional four-way TCP handshake to allow\n   extended option space to be used
    in SYN packets in both directions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
