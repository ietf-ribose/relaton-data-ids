abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec is specified as the means of securing signaling messages\n
    \  between the Mobile Node and Home agent for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6).\n   MIPv6 signalling
    messages that are secured include the Binding\n   Updates and Acknowledgement
    messages used for managing the bindings\n   between a Mobile Node and its Home
    Agent.  This document proposes an\n   alternate method for securing MIPv6 signaling
    messages between a\n   Mobile Nodes and Home Agents.  The alternate method defined
    here\n   conists of a MIPv6-specific authentication option that can be added\n
    \  to MIPv6 signalling messages\n\t </p>\n      "
