abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 link-local addresses are formed from the prefix fe80::/10 which
    is followed by 54 "zero" bits, then followed by a 64-bit Interface Identifier.
    There are multiple methods for generating link-local addresses, and multiple may
    be in use by nodes on the same link (and sometimes even the same interface) at
    the same time. This document defines an IPv6 link-local address "Type" field that
    identifies the type of link-local address being used.</p>
