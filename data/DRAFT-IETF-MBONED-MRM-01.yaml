abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MRM facilitates automated fault detection and fault isolation
    in a\nlarge multicast routing infrastructure. It is designed to alarm a\nnetwork
    administrator of multicast reachability problems in close\nto real-time.\nThere
    are two basic types of components in MRM, MRM manager and MRM\ntesters. This document
    specifies the protocol with which the two MRM\ncomponents communicate, the types
    of operations the testers perform,\nand information an MRM manager can obtain.\n\t
