abstract:
- content: <p>Redundancy Protection is a generalized protection mechanism to achieve
    the high reliability of service transmission in Segment Routing network. The mechanism
    inherits the "Live-Live" methodology, targeting to enhance the functionalities
    of Segment Routing over IPv6. Inspired by DetNet Packet Replication and Packet
    Elimination functions, two new Segments are introduced to provide replication
    and elimination functions on specific network nodes by leveraging SRv6 Segment
    programming capabilities.</p>
