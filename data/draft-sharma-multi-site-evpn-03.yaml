abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or more
    BGP based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) sites in a scalable fashion over an IP-only network.
    The motivation is to support extension of EVPN sites without having to rely on
    typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS for the interconnection.
    The requirements for such a deployment are very similar to the ones specified
    in RFC 7209 -- "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)".</p>
