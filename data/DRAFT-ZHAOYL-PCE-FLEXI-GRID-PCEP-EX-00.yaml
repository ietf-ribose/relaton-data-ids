abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flexi-grid networks overcomes the fixed grid channel of Wavelength\n
    \  Switched Optical Network(WSON) by flexible spectrum to allow non-\n   uniform
    and dynamic allocation of spectrum based on the demand of the\n   incoming services'
    LSP.  Flexi-grid networks is an effective solution\n   to solve the problem of
    efficient spectrum utilization.\n\n   Because the client LSP needs to be assigned
    contiguous spectrum in\n   flexi-grid networks, there will be two problems that
    would affect\n   spectrum utilization, i.e.  RSA and fragmentation.  We introduce
    two\n   kinds of methods which can improve the spectrum utilization further,\n
    \  and some related PCEP extensions are defined in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n
