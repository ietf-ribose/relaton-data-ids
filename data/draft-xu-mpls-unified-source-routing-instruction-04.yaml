abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS in short) is an MPLS data plane-based
    source routing paradigm in which a sender of a packet is allowed to partially
    or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network by imposing
    stacked MPLS labels to the packet. SR-MPLS could be leveraged to realize a unified
    source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS
    label stack as a unified source routing instruction set while preserving backward
    compatibility with SR-MPLS.</p>"
