abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide\n
    \  telemetry framework based on INT (In-band Network Telemetry), by\n   decoupling
    the network monitoring system into a routing mechanism and\n   a routing path
    generation policy.  INT-path embeds SR (Source\n   Routing) into INT probes to
    allow specifying the route that the probe\n   packet takes through the network.
    \ Above this probing path control\n   mechanism, an Euler trail-based path planning
    policy is developed to\n   generate non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire
    network with\n   a minimum path number, reducing the overall telemetry overhead.
    \ INT-\n   path is very suitable for deployment in data center networks thanks\n
    \  to their symmetric topologies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
