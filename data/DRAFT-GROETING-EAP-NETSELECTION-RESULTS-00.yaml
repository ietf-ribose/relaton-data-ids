abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to highlight implementation results on network\n
    \  discovery as well as some new ideas for its extension.  The\n   implementation
    is based on the draft on mediating network discovery,\n   a mechanism that enables
    a mobile node to discover roaming partners\n   of an access network via EAP.  The
    concept allows automatic network\n   selection of end hosts, based on additional
    parameters, hence\n   reducing interacting with the user.This document should
    also open a\n   discussion on the need on network capability mechanisms.\n\t </p>\n
