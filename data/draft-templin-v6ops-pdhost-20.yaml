abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which assign
    them to their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting node can
    provision the prefix according to whether it acts as a router on behalf of any
    downstream networks and/or as a host on behalf of its local applications. In the
    latter case, the requesting node can use portions of the delegated prefix for
    its own multi- addressing purposes. This document therefore considers prefix delegation
    models for both the classic routing and multi-addressing use cases.</p>"
