abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives\n
    \  attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by\n   eavesdropping
    on network connections.  The DNS Transaction Signature\n   (TSIG) mechanism is
    specified to restrict direct zone transfer to\n   authorized clients only, but
    it does not add confidentiality.  This\n   document specifies use of DNS-over-TLS
    to prevent zone contents\n   collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
