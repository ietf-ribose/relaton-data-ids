abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines Group Object Security for Constrained
    RESTful\n   Environments (Group OSCORE), providing end-to-end security of CoAP\n
    \  messages exchanged between members of a group, e.g., sent over IP\n   multicast.
    \ In particular, the described approach defines how OSCORE\n   is used in a group
    communication setting to provide source\n   authentication for CoAP group requests,
    sent by a client to multiple\n   servers, and for protection of the corresponding
    CoAP responses.\n   Group OSCORE also defines a pairwise mode where each member
    of the\n   group can efficiently derive a symmetric pairwise key with any other\n
    \  member of the group for pairwise OSCORE communication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
