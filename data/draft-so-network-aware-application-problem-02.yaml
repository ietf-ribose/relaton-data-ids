abstract:
  content: "<p>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such asvideo
    gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers usedto provide application
    services are distributed geographically arounda network, many decisions made in
    the control and management ofapplication services, such as where to instantiate
    another serviceinstance or to which server a new client is assigned, should be
    madewith the knowledge of the underlying network resources availabilityand the
    application resources conditions.Currently such decisions are made with very little
    or no informationconcerning the underlying network used to deliver those services.Hence
    such decisions are inherently sub-optimal. In addition the lackof network awareness
    may result in not meeting the end-userapplication service objectives.</p>"
