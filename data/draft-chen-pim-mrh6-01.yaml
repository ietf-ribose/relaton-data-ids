abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an efficient solution for multicast along an
    explicit P2MP Path/Tree using an IPv6 extension header called multicast routing
    header (MRH). The MRH with the path encoded in link numbers is added into a packet
    to be multicast at the ingress. The packet is delivered to the egresses along
    the path. There is no state stored in the core of the network.</p>"
