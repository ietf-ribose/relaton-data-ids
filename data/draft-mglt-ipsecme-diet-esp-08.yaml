abstract:
- content: "<p>With the use of encrypted ESP for secure IP communication, the compression
    of IP payload is only possible with complex frameworks, such as RObust Header
    Compression (ROHC). Such frameworks are too complex for numerous use cases and
    especially for IoT scenarios, which makes IPsec not being used here, although
    it offers architectural benefits. ESP Header Compression (EHC) defines a flexible
    framework to compress communications protected with IPsec/ESP. Compression and
    decompression is defined by EHC Rules orchestrated by EHC Strategies. The necessary
    state is hold within the IPsec Security Association and can be negotiated during
    key agreement, e.g. with IKEv2. The document specifies the necessary parameters
    of the EHC Context to allow compression of ESP and the most common included protocols,
    such as IPv4, IPv6, UDP and TCP and the corresponding EHC Rules. It also defines
    the Diet-ESP EHC Strategy which compresses up to 32 bytes per packet for traditional
    IPv6 VPN and up to 66 bytes for IPv6 VPN sent over a single TCP or UDP session.</p>"
