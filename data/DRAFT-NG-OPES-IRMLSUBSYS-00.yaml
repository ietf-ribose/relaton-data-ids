abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based
    \nlanguage that can be used to describe service-specific execution \nrules for
    network edge intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge \nServices (OPES) framework,
    as described in [3] and [4].  This memo \ndiscusses the need for OPES framework
    to have different sub-systems \nin different deployment scenario, and proposes
    additions to IRML for \na more flexible approach to supporting different sub-systems.
    \ \n\n\t </p>\n      "
