abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For access network operators, accounting information are crucial:\nthey
    provide information for billing and give an overview of the\ntraffic usage.  This
    document defines the requirements for accounting\ninformation needed on Softwires.1.
    \ Motivation\n\nThe Softwires WG is working on a solution to bring IPvX connectivity\nover
    an IPvY network [RFC4925].  This solution may be deployed and\nmanaged by access
    network operators to provide for example IPvX\ncontinuity of service.  Operators
    should then consider the Softwires\nsolution as an extension of their access network
    service.\n\nFor operators, AAA [RFC2865] is the key feature for access network\ndeployment:
    Authentication verifies user credentials, Authorization\nensures access network
    integrity and Accounting provides information\nfor billing and network management.
    \ Information from accounting\nusually includes measurements of in and out octets
    and packets\n[RFC2867].\n\nAs an alternative access network, the Softwires solution
    should\nprovide similar AAA features.  For instance accounting on the\nsoftwire
    should gives to the operator measurements of the traffic\ngenerated by the user
    using this access network.  In a dual stack\n(IPvX and IPvY) network, the operator
    may want to manage information\nabout the comparative usage of both protocols,
    for example for\nbilling purpose.  When the softwire is used to access IPvX over
    IPvY,\naccounting information will be specific to IPvX.  Operators should be\nable
    to differentiate for which version of IP such information are\nrelevant.  This
    differentiation may become important if such\noperators offer a softwire solution
    for both IPvX over IPvY and IPvY\nover IPvX access networks.2.  Study case\n\nIn
    this section is given an example of IPv6 access over IPv4 network\nwhich is similar
    to the Hub-and-Spokes problem stated in the\nSoftwires WG ([RFC4925]).  The Point6box
    architecture uses L2TP\n[RFC2661] and PPP for IPv6 tunneling over IPv4 (see Figure
    1).\nRadius manages AAA parameters for the access network created by the\ntunnel.
    \ On the server side, PPP sends to RADIUS accounting\ninformation measuring the
    traffic generated by the customer.\n\n\n\n/---------------------------\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

    \ Figure 1: Point6Box Service Architecture3.  Problem statement\n\nThe accounting
    information defined for tunnels [RFC2867] includes\nattributes Acct-{Input,Output}-Octets
    and Acct-{Input,Output}-Packets\nfor traffic measurements.  These attributes do
    not depend of the\nversion of IP used by the monitored traffic.  Operators may
    not be\nable to differenciate IPv4 from IPv6 traffic in their accounting\nstatistics.
    \ This non-differentiation even leads to mis-usages: In\nthe current PPP implementation
    from BSD, the values of these\nattributes are only based on IPv4 statistics collected
    from IPCP\nprotocol.  No statistics are collected for IPv6 from IPV6CP.\n\nThis
    proposal should decide which attributes may be candidate for IP-\nversion differentiation.
    \ In operating system MIBs, values for in/out\noctets on a network interface are
    independent of the IP version.\nHaving such values for each version may be usefull
    for monitoring and\nbilling purpose.  However the differentiation is done for
    in/out IPv4\nand IPv6 packets on a network interface.  Operators can extract from\nthese
    values some hints about the usage of each version of the IP\nprotocol but can
    not give quantitative report of bandwidth usage.\n\t </p>\n      "
