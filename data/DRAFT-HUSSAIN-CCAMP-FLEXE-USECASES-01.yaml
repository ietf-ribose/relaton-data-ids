abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match
    the rates\n   of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3]
    was\n   the first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY\n   rates.
    \ OIF has recently approved another implementation agreement\n   [OIFFLEXE1] which
    allows complete decoupling of the MAC data rates\n   and the Ethernet PHY(s) that
    support them.  This includes support for\n   (a) MAC rates which are greater than
    the rate of a single PHY\n   (satisfied by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC
    rates which are\n   less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple
    FlexE\n   client signals carried over a single PHY, or over a collection of\n
    \  bonded PHY(s).  This draft catalogs the usecases that are encountered\n   when
    these Flexible rate Ethernet client signals are transported over\n   OTN networks.\n\n\t
