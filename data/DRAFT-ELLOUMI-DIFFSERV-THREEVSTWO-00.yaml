abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This informational memo points out advantages of using three drop\nprecedences
    (compared to two) in the Assured Forwarding (AF) Per-\nHop-Behavior (PHB) when
    the traffic is composed of responsive TCP and\nnon responsive UDP traffic.  Our
    simulation results show that while\ntwo drop precedences can, in some cases, guarantee
    to an aggregate\nconsisting of TCP traffic the full utilization of the reserved\nbandwidth,
    they cannot allow to access the unreserved bandwidth in\nthe presence of high
    bit rate unresponsive UDP traffic. When three\ndrop precedences are appropriately
    used TCP aggregates can fully use\nthe minimum reserved bandwidth and share the
    unreserved one.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
