abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures for using Bidirectional
    Forwarding\n   Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks to detect data plane failures\n
    \  in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp)\n   Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) using active tails with unsolicited\n   notifications mode.
    \ It also describes the applicability of LSP Ping,\n   as in-band, and the control
    plane, as out-band, solutions to\n   bootstrap a BFD session in this environment.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
