abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically\n
    \  configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6\n   to
    function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms, the\n   operator must obtain
    information about the IPv4 address and Port Set\n   ID allocated to the DHCP 4o6
    client, as well as the /128 IPv6 prefix\n   that the client will use as the source
    of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This\n   memo defines a DHCPv6 container option and two
    DHCPv6 sub-options\n   used to communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address between
    the DHCP\n   4o6 client and server.  It is designed to work in conjunction with\n
    \  the IPv4 address allocation process.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
