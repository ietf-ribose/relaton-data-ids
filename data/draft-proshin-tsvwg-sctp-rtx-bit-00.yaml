abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method which helps an SCTP sender to understand
    when a received SACK acknowledges the original transmission of a TSN or its retransmission.
    It is done by specifying a new bit, called Retransmit bit (R-bit), in the header
    of DATA, I-DATA and SACK chunks. The bit is used when a TSN is retransmitted and
    returned back in the acknowledgement.</p>"
