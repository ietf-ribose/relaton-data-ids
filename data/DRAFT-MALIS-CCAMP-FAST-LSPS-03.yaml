abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Establishment and control of Label Switch Paths (LSPs) have
    become\n   mainstream tools of commercial and government network providers.  One\n
    \  of the elements of further evolving such networks is scaling their\n   performance
    in terms of LSP bandwidth and traffic loads, LSP\n   intensity (e.g., rate of
    LSP creation, deletion, and modification),\n   LSP set up delay, quality of service
    differentiation, and different\n   levels of resilience.\n\n   The goal of this
    document is to present target scaling objectives and\n   the related protocol
    requirements for Generalized Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (GMPLS).  The
    document also summarizes key factors\n   affecting current GMPLS signaling procedures
    in meeting these\n   application scaling requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
