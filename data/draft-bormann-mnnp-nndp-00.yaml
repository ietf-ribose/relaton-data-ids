abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture and a set of protocols for
    distributing Netnews [RFC0977, RFC1036] via IP multicast enabled networks. The
    architecture is designed to be useful in the global Internet. In particular, it
    allows multiple news servers to cooperate on multicasting each new article only
    once. To facilitate scalability to tens of thousands of news servers, it also
    provides for receive-only multicast participants (that continue to send articles
    via conventional NNTP). This document is a submission to the IETF MNNP working
    group. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working groups' mailing
    list at ietf-mnnp@va.pubnix.com and/or the author.</p>"
