abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for implementing a session policy
    channel using EAP. It defines a standard mechanism by which a mobile device can
    conduct a session policy exchange with a policy network component, using EAP as
    a lower layer protocol, to obtain session policies. EAP Re-authentication Protocol
    is suggested as a mechanism to allow asynchronous use of SIP at upper layers.</p>"
