abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet
    (TSoP)\n   mechanism to encapsulate Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or\n   Synchronous
    Optical NETwork (SONET) bit-streams in a packet format,\n   suitable for Pseudowire
    (PW) transport over a packet switched network\n   (PSN).  The key property of
    the TSoP  method is that it transports\n   the SDH/SONET client signal in its
    entirety through the PW, i.e., no\n   use is made of any specific characteristic
    of the SONET/SDH signal\n   format, other than its bit rate.  The TSoP transparency
    includes\n   transporting the timing properties of the SDH/SONET client signal.\n
    \  This ensures a maximum of transparency and a minimum of complexity,\n   both
    in implementation and during operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
