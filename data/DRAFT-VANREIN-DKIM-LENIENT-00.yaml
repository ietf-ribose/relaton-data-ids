abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DKIM is a framework for signed messages, especially for email.
    \ While\n   in transit, changes are sometimes made, and these break the DKIM-\n
    \  Signature.  This specification makes DKIM more lenient, without\n   changes
    to its core.  It adds leniency towards MIME body rewrites,\n   removal of alternatives
    and annotation with bits of text.  The\n   intention is to allow these changes
    such that they can be clearly\n   shown to the user, while indicating that the
    remainder of the\n   signedmessage is still in tact.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
