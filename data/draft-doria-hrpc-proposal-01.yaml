abstract:
- content: "<p>Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered when
    creating an Internet protocol. This draft suggests that similar considerations
    may apply for other human rights such as freedom of expression or freedom of association.
    A proposal is made for work in the IRTF researching the possible connections between
    human rights and Internet standards and protocols. The goal is to create an informational
    RFC concerning human rights protocol considerations. Discussion on this draft
    at: hrpc@article19.io</p>"
