abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes the security implications of using IPv6\n
    \  Extension Headers with Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.  It updates\n   RFC
    4861 such that use of the IPv6 Fragmentation Header is forbidden\n   in all Neighbor
    Discovery messages, thus allowing for simple and\n   effective counter-measures
    for Neighbor Discovery attacks.  Finally,\n   it discusses the security implications
    of using IPv6 fragmentation\n   with SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), and provides
    advice such that\n   the aforementioned security implications are mitigated.\n\n\t
