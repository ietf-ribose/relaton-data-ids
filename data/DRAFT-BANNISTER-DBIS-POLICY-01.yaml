abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services
    (DBIS)\n   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support the shadow\n
    \  databases.\n\n   The shadow database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with
    the\n   Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries\n
    \  so that it may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access\n   Protocol
    [RFC4510].\n\n   A shadow database extends user login accounts with credential
    policy\n   data.\n\n   This document represents shadow database entries as an
    extended set\n   of attributes that may be applied to both passwd and group database\n
    \  entries for the management of consistent password policies.\n\n   This document
    describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n   mapping-00] for shadow
    databases, and database entries referenced by\n   those maps.\n\t </p>\n      "
