abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Handover Information Services may be used to assist handovers
    between\none network to another network or within a network, based on stored\nnetwork
    knowledge.  Information Services can be used to provide\nessential network related
    information e.g. topology and channel\ninformation which may allow a moving host
    to select an appropriate\nlink-layer connection to make, amongst available networks,
    whether\nusing the same technology or heterogeneous technologies.\n\nThis document
    is an effort to describe use cases and transport\nrequirements for handover information
    services, when they are\ntransported over IP networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
