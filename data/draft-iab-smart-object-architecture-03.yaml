abstract:
- content: <p>Following the theme "Everything that can be connected will be connected",
    engineers and researchers designing smart object networks need to decide how to
    achieve this in practice. How can different forms of embedded and constrained
    devices be interconnected? How can they employ and interact with the currently
    deployed Internet? This memo discusses smart objects and some of the architectural
    choices involved in designing smart object networks and protocols that they use.</p>
