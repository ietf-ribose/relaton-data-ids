abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts
    on a\n   server using JMAP.\n\nOpen Issues\n\n   o  Do we need/want both \"content\"
    and \"blobId\" in the SieveScript\n      object?  It may be simpler to have just
    one way of specifying\n      content and \"blobId\" is more versatile and doesn't
    require JSON-\n      encoding of the content.  Furthermore, use of the forthcoming(?)\n
    \     Blob/set method would avoid the extra roundtrip of having to\n      upload
    the blob first.\n\n   o  The strawman for SieveScript/test only uses blobIds.
    \ Will this\n      have to change once the issue regarding content/blobId in\n
    \     SieveScript is resolved?\n\n   o  Should \":fcc\" and associated arguments
    (e.g., \":flags\",\n      \":create\":, etc) reported in the /test response be
    in their own\n      \"fcc\" sub-object rather than listed inline with the rest
    of the\n      arguments for the action?\n\n\t </p>\n      "
