abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a method of representing the registration
    policy\n   that a zone administrator uses for registering Internationalised\n
    \  Domain Names using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These registry\n   policies,
    commonly known as \"IDN tables\", are used to enforce and\n   share policy on
    which specific code-points are permitted for\n   registrations, and which alternative
    code-points are considered\n   variants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
