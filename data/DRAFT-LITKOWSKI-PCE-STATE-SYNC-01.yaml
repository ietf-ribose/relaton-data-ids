abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n
    \  A Path Computation Client (PCC) can synchronize an LSP state\n   information
    to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).  The\n   stateful PCE extension
    allows a redundancy scenario where a PCC can\n   have redundant PCEP sessions
    towards multiple PCEs.  In such a case,\n   a PCC gives control on a LSP to only
    a single PCE, and only one PCE\n   is responsible for path computation for this
    delegated LSP.  The\n   document does not state the procedures related to an inter-PCE\n
    \  stateful communication.\n\n   There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE
    stateful communication\n   can bring additional resiliency in the design for instance
    when some\n   PCC-PCE sessions fails.  The inter-PCE stateful communication may\n
    \  also provide a faster update of the LSP states when an event occurs.\n   Finally,
    when, in a redundant PCE scenario, there is a need to\n   compute a set of paths
    that are part of a group (so there is a\n   dependency between the paths), there
    may be some cases where the\n   computation of all paths in the group is not handled
    by the same PCE:\n   this situation is called a split-brain.  This split-brain
    scenario\n   may lead to computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal paths\n
    \  computation.\n\n   This document describes the procedures to allow a stateful\n
    \  communication between PCEs for various use-cases and also the\n   procedures
    to prevent computations loops.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
