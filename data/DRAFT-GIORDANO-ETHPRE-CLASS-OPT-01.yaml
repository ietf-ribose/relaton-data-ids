abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, is a family of frame-based\nnetworking
    technologies for local area networks. It's the most\nwidespread wired LAN technology.\nThis
    document proposes a variation of the original frame's structure\nto perform a
    frame's classification and a switching optimization\n(fundamental steps for QoS
    mechanism).\n\t </p>\n      "
