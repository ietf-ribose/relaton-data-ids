abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants
    and\n   other well-known values.  Even after a protocol has been defined and\n
    \  deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (such as for\n   a
    new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication\n   transform for
    IPsec).  To ensure that such quantities have consistent\n   values and interpretations
    across all implementations, their\n   assignment must be administered by a central
    authority.  For IETF\n   protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned
    Numbers\n   Authority (IANA).\n\n   In order for IANA to manage a given namespace
    prudently, it needs\n   guidelines describing the conditions under which new values
    can be\n   assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made.  If\n
    \  IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace,\n   IANA
    must be given clear and concise instructions describing that\n   role.  This document
    discusses issues that should be considered in\n   formulating a policy for assigning
    values to a namespace and provides\n   guidelines for authors on the specific
    text that must be included in\n   documents that place demands on IANA.\n\n   This
    document obsoletes RFC 5226.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
