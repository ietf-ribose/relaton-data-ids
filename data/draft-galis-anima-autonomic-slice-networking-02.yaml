abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the technical requirements and the related
    reference model for the intercommunication and coordination among devices in Autonomic
    Slicing Networking. The goal is to define how the various elements in a network
    slicing context work and orchestrate together, to describe their interfaces and
    relations. While the document is written as generally as possible, the initial
    solutions are limited to the chartered scope of the WG.</p>"
