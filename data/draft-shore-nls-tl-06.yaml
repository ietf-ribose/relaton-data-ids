abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along
    adatapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond whatthe protocol
    designers envisioned, and while the architectural modelgeneralizes well the protocol
    itself has a number of features thatlimit its applicability to applications other
    than IntServ. NetworkLayer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication model
    andprovides a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signalingapplications, such
    as discovery or diagnostics. It is based on a\"two-layer\" architecture that divides
    protocol function intotransport and application. This document describes the transportprotocol.</p>"
