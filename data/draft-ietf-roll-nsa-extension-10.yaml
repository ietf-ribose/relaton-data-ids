abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet Replication and Elimination is a method in which several copies
    of a data packet are sent in the network in order to achieve high reliability
    and low jitter. This document details how to apply Packet Replication and Elimination
    in RPL, especially how to exchange information within RPL control packets to let
    a node better select the different parents that will be used to forward the multiple
    copies of a packet. This document also describes the Objective Function which
    takes advantage of this information to implement multi-path routing.</p>"
