abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the international standard\n
    \  timescale used in many Internet protocols.  UTC features occasional\n   single-second
    adjustments, known as \"leap seconds\".  These happen at\n   the end of announced
    UTC days, in the form of either an extra second\n   23:59:60 or a missing second
    23:59:59.  Both events need special\n   consideration in UTC-synchronized systems
    that represent time as a\n   scalar value.  This specification defines UTC-SLS,
    a minor variation\n   of UTC that lacks leap seconds.  Instead, UTC-SLS performs
    an\n   equivalent \"smooth\" adjustment, during which the rate of the clock\n
    \  temporarily changes by 0.1% for 1000 seconds.  UTC-SLS is a drop-in\n   replacement
    for UTC.  UTC-SLS can be generated from the same\n   information as UTC.  It can
    be used with any specification that\n   refers to UTC but lacks provisions for
    leap seconds.  UTC-SLS\n   provides a robust and interoperable way for networked
    UTC-\n   synchronized clocks to handle leap seconds.  By providing UTC-SLS\n   instead
    of UTC to applications, operating systems can free most\n   application and protocol
    designers from any need to even know about\n   UTC leap seconds.\n\t </p>\n      "
