abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The FMIPv6 specification [1] allows mobile node sending packet
    using\n   previous Care of Address (PCoA) at a new subnet.  But such packets\n
    \  are ignored at home agent or correspondent node because the Binding\n   Cache
    doesn't contain the PCoA anymore.  To avoid this problem, we\n   propose keeping
    old binding cache for a bit.\n\t </p>\n      "
