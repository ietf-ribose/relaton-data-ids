abstract:
- content: "<p>The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a tool to describe the
    limited access that a single function device such as an Internet of Things device
    might need. The enforcement of the access control lists described protects the
    device from attacks from the Internet, and protects the Internets from compromised
    devices. This document details the process which occurs when a device is detected
    to have violated the stated policy. The goal of these steps is to ensure that
    the device is correctly removed from operation, fixed, and if possible, restored
    to safe operation.</p>"
