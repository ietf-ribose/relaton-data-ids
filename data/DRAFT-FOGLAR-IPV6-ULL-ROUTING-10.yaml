abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This Internet-Draft describes a hierarchical addressing scheme\n
    \ for IPv6, intentionally very much simplified to allow for ultralow\n  latency
    source routing experimentation using simple forwarding\n  nodes. Research groups
    evaluate achievable latency reduction for\n  special applications such as radio
    access networks, industrial net-\n  works or other networks requiring very low
    latency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
