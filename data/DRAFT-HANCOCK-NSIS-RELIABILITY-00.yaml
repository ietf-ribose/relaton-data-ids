abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Next Steps in Signaling working group is developing a protocol
    \nsuite for signaling information about a data flow along its path in \nthe network.
    The lower layer in the protocol suite, the NSIS \nTransport Layer Protocol (NTLP)
    is intended to provide a generally \nuseful transport service for such signaling
    messages. \nThere is a long-running open question about how much (if at all) the
    \nNTLP should provide reliable message transport. There is a large \namount of
    confusion about what this question even means, let alone \nhow to answer it. This
    document identifies the possible reliability \nrequirements for signaling protocols
    in general, based on past \nevaluations of RSVP and research in soft-state protocol
    performance. \nIt makes a proposal for what kind of reliable transport functionality
    \nshould be supported in the NTLP, and discusses some of the resulting \nimpacts
    and constraints on the NTLP design. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
