abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While it is a necessary feature that the home agent tunnelsmulticast
    packets to mobile nodes away from home, it can causesevere network congestion
    on the forward path between the homeagent and the care-of address nodes, because
    of the unicasttunneling of multicast packets. Multicast avalanche avoidance inMobile
    IP (MAAMIP) is designed to avoid the network congestion byusing of Explicit multicast
    tunneling. Explicit multicast tunnelingin Mobile IP enables avoidance of network
    congestion and realizesthe true bandwidth saving, which is the primitive goal
    ofmulticast.</p>"
