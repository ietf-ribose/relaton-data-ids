abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select
    the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user agent's characteristics,
    as expressed in request headers. In practice, clients are often unwilling to send
    those request headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and
    sending them impacts both performance and privacy. This document defines an Accept-CH
    response header that servers can use to advertise their use of request headers
    for proactive content negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation
    of such headers, colloquially known as "Client Hints."</p>
