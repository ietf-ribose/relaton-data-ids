abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization protocol [RFC7285].  While the current ALTO Cost\n   Services
    only allow applications to obtain numerical/ordinal cost\n   values on an end-to-end
    path defined by its source and destination,\n   the present extension enables
    the provision of abstracted information\n   on particular Abstract Network Elements
    on the path.  These Abstract\n   Network Elements, or simply Elements, are components
    of the network\n   which handle data packets, and their properties may have an
    impact on\n   the end-to-end performance of the applications' traffic.  Examples
    of\n   such Elements include physical devices such as routers, cables and\n   interfaces,
    and aggregations of devices such as subnetworks and data\n   centers.  Such information
    is useful for applications whose\n   performance is impacted by particular Abstract
    Network Elements they\n   traverse or by their properties.  Applications having
    the choice\n   among several connection paths may use this information to select\n
    \  paths accordingly and improve their performance.  In particular, they\n   may
    infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic\n   bottlenecks
    by avoiding such paths.  This document introduces a new\n   cost type called Path
    Vector.  A Path Vector is an array of entities\n   that each identifies an Abstract
    Network Element (ANE).  Each ANE is\n   associated with a set of properties.  ANE
    properties are conveyed by\n   an ALTO information resource called \"Property
    Map\", that can be\n   packed together with the Path Vectors in a multipart response.
    \ They\n   can also be obtained via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map.\n
    \  An ALTO Property Map is an extension to the ALTO protocol, that is\n   specified
    in another document entitled \"Unified Properties for the\n   ALTO Protocol\"
    [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
