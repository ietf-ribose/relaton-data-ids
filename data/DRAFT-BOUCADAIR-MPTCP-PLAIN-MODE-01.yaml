abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP
    (MPTCP)\n   is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected
    to\n   multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of its\n
    \  network attachments.  Because of the lack of MPTCP support at the\n   server
    side, some service providers now consider a \"network-assisted\n   mode\" that
    relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called\n   MPTCP Concentrator.
    \ This document focuses on a deployment scheme\n   where the identity of the MPTCP
    Concentrator(s) is explicitly\n   configured on connected hosts.\n\n   This document
    specifies an MPTCP option that is used to get rid of an\n   encapsulation scheme
    between the CPE and the MPTCP Concentrator.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
