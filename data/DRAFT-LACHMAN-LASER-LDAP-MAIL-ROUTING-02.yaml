abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an LDAP [1] object class called\n'inetLocalMailRecipient'
    and associated attributes that provide a way\nto designate an LDAP entry as one
    that represents a local (intra-\norganizational) email recipient, to specify the
    recipient's email\naddress(es), and to provide routing information pertinent to
    the\nrecipient.  This is intended to support SMTP [2] message transfer\nagents
    in routing RFC 822-based email [3] within a private enterprise\nonly, and is not
    to be used in the process of routing email across\nthe public Internet.\n\t </p>\n
