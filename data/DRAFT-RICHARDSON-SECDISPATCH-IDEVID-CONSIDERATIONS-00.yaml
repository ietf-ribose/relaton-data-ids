abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a number of operational modes that a\n
    \  manufacturer of devices that include IEEE 802.1AR IDevID certificates\n   may
    choose from.  Different ways of generating and signing the needed\n   keypairs
    are detailed, and the security tradeoffs of each method are\n   considered.  This
    document provides a nomenclature for each mode.\n\n   IDevID certificates are
    used in ANIMA's BRSKI Manufacturer Authorized\n   Signing Authority (MASA) process.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
