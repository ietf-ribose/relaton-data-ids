abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing\n
    \  system, known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in\n   recent
    years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant\n   disruptions to Internet
    routing are labeled \"route leaks\", but to\n   date we have lacked a common definition
    of the term.  In this\n   document, we provide a working definition of route leaks,
    keeping in\n   mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention.\n
    \  Further, we attempt to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different\n   types
    of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet.  We\n   aim to provide
    a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks\n   that have been observed
    and are of concern to Internet user community\n   as well as the network operator
    community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
