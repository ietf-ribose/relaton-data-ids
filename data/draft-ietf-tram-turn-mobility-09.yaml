abstract:
- content: "<p>It is desirable to minimize traffic disruption caused by changing IP
    address during a mobility event. One mechanism to minimize disruption is to expose
    a shorter network path to the mobility event so that only the local network elements
    are aware of the changed IP address and the remote peer is unaware of the changed
    IP address. This document provides such an IP address mobility solution using
    Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN). This is achieved by allowing a client
    to retain an allocation on the TURN server when the IP address of the client changes.</p>"
