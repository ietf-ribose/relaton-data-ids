abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Using localized mobility management based on IPv6, all packets\ndestined
    to a mobile node are routed through the local mobility\nagent in the mobile node's
    local mobility domain, which then\ntunnels the packets to the mobile node's current
    location. Such\npacket routing mechanism is similar to the triangle routing in\nMobile
    IPv4, which may leave the local mobility agent overloaded\nand take a longer route
    thus increasing the network traffic in the\nlocal mobility domain. This document
    specifies a route optimization\nscheme for localized mobility management based
    on IPv6 with the\nhelp of L2 trigger. Using this, correspondent nodes can cache
    LCoA\nof a mobile node if it is actively communicating with the mobile\nnode,
    and then send their packets for the mobile node directly to\nthe LCoA, bypassing
    the local mobility agent. This route\noptimization scheme will result in more
    efficient localized\nmobility management. It alleviates the local mobility agent's
    loads\nand takes the nearly same handoff delay time as the one in\nlocalized mobility
    management based on IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
