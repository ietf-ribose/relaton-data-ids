abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in
    aProxy Mobile IPv6 domain through enabling differentiated services.When a packet
    is encapsulated in a mobile access gateway (or a localmobility anchor), the differentiated
    services codepoint (DSCP) fieldin the outer header is mapped to the priority of
    a mobile node, orthe precedence of an application of the mobile node. Intermediaryrouters
    between the mobile access gateway and the local mobilityanchor, which forward
    the packet based on the outer header of thepacket, prioritize the packet according
    to the DSCP value of theouter header.</p>"
