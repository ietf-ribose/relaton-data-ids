abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN E-Tree defines a composite tunnel to be used for a Root
    PE to\n   simultaneously indicate a non-Ingress-Replication tunnel (e.g., P2MP\n
    \  tunnel) in the transmit direction and an Ingress Replication tunnel\n   in
    the receive direction for BUM traffic.  This document extends it\n   to more generic
    use in both MVPN and general EVPN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
