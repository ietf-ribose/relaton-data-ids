abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Researchers proposed DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP\n
    \  fragmentation.  This document shows feasible and adequate measures at\n   full-service
    resolvers against these attacks.  To protect resolvers\n   from these attacks,
    avoid fragmentation (limit requestor's UDP\n   payload size to 1220/1232), drop
    fragmented UDP DNS responses and use\n   TCP at resolver side.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
