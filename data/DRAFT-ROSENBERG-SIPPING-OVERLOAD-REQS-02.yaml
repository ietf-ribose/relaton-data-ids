abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks
    when\n   proxies and user agents have insuffient resources to complete the\n   processing
    of a request.  SIP provides limited support for overload\n   handling through
    its 503 response code, which tells an upstream\n   element that it is overloaded.
    \ However, numerous problems have been\n   identified with this mechanism.  This
    draft summarizes the problems\n   with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides
    some requirements for a\n   solution.\n\t </p>\n      "
