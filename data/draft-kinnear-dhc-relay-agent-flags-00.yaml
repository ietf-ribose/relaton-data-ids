abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay agent information
    option that allows the DHCP relay to specify flags for the forwarded packet. One
    flag is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay received the packet via a unicast
    or broadcast packet. This information may be used by the DHCP server to better
    serve clients based on whether their request was originally broadcast or unicast.</p>"
