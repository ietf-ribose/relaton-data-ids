abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a "Bit Index Explicit Replication Traffic Engineering"
    (BIER-TE) header, two levels of Bit Index Forwarding Tables (BIFTs) and a forwarding
    procedure for efficiently processing BIER-TE packets with the header. For a multicast
    packet with an explicit point-to-multipoint (P2MP) path, which has multiple BitStrings,
    the packet with the header containing the BitStrings is replicated and forwarded
    statelessly along the path.</p>
