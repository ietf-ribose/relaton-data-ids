    Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1]. The purpose of this extension would be to create
    a means for publishing event state used within the framework for SIP Event Notification
    (RFC3265 [2]). The first application of this extension is targeted at the publication
    of presence information as defined by the SIMPLE [5] working group.</p>"
