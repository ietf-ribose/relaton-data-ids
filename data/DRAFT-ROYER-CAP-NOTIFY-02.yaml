abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a method used to ask for and receive\nnotifications.
    \ These notifications will be the direct result of a\nstored components and the
    notifications or changes to components or\nthe store and are represented in iCalendar
    format. This is an\nextensions to iCalendar objects.\nThis memo has been updated
    to include non-CAP notificaitons.\nThis memo includes a new CAP command types
    of 'REQUEST-NOTIFY',\n'NOTIFICATION', and 'CANCEL-NOTIFY', a new property of 'OBSERVER',
    a\nnew iCalendar component 'NOTIFICATION', CAP capabilities of\n'CAN-NOTIFY',
    'NOTIFY-UPDATES', and 'ALLOW-NOTIFY-BOT'. A\n'REQUEST-NOTIFY' command is a request
    to add an observer to an\ncomponent in the 'TARGET' calendar. In addition the
    'REQUEST-NOTIFY'\ncommand can alert the CUA of changes to specific components
    or in the\ncalendar or calendar store. Everything is subject to VCAR\nrestrictions.\nThese
    are asynchronous notifications must be advertised by the CS and\nrequested by
    the CUA. This memo discusses how to transport these\niCalendar objects and using
    them with CAP.\nIn addition if the CS and CUA support the 'NOTIFY-UPDATES'\ncapability,
    then the CS will send 'NOTIFICATION' components to the\nCUA describing the UIDs
    or TARGETS that have changed since the\ncurrently authenticated CU was last connected
    allowing for easier\nsynchronization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
