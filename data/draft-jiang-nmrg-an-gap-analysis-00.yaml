abstract:
- content: "<p>This document summarises a problem statement for an IP-based autonomic
    network that is mainly based on distributed network devices. The document reviews
    the history and current status of autonomic aspects of IP networks. It then reviews
    the current network management style, which is still heavily depending on human
    administrators. Finally the document describes the general gaps between the ideal
    autonomic network concept and the current network abilities.</p>"
