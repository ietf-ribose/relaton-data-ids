abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses a lightweight service simplification method
    via\n   DNS.  Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure,\n
    \  the service provider can store them on the DNS servers.  By\n   expressing
    these information in the DNS Resource Records, the\n   requester can get these
    information directly during the DNS name\n   resolution, without the need of accessing
    any web resource.  This way\n   eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake
    and HTTP get/\n   response, and can be served as a lightweight information provisioning\n
    \  method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
