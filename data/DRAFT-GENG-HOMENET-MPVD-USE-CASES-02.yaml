abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use cases of multiple provisioning
    domain\n   (MPVD) in homenet.  Although most residential networks nowadays are\n
    \  connected to a single ISP and normally subscribed to standard\n   internet
    service, it is expected that much wider range of devices and\n   services will
    become common in home networks.  Homenet defines such\n   home network topologies
    with increasing number of devices with the\n   assumption that it requires minimum
    configuration by residential\n   user.  As described in the homenet architecture
    ([RFC7368]),\n   multihoming and multi-service residential network will be more
    common\n   in the near future.  Nodes in such network may commonly have multiple\n
    \  interfaces or subscribe to multiple services.  Potential types of\n   PVD-aware
    nodes concerning interface and service specific\n   provisioning domains are introduced
    in this document.  Based on this,\n   different MPVD configuration examples are
    given.  These examples\n   illustrate how PVD may be implemented in home network.
    \ PVDs provide\n   independent provisioning domains for different interfaces and\n
    \  services, which enables robust and flexible network configuration for\n   these
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
