abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an applicability statement for the use
    of UDP\n   transport checksums when used with IPv6.  This defines\n   recommendations
    and requirements for use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a\n   zero checksum.  It examines
    the role of the IPv6 UDP transport\n   checksum, as defined in RFC2460 and presents
    a summary of the trade-\n   offs for evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460
    to permit an IPv6\n   UDP endpoint to use a zero value in the checksum field as
    an\n   indication that no checksum is present.  This method is compared with\n
    \  some other possibilities.  The document also describes the issues and\n   design
    principles that need to be considered when UDP is used with\n   IPv6 to support
    tunnel encapsulations.\n\n   XXX NOTE - This revision is a partial response to
    comments received\n   during IESG review.  There are additional comments to be
    incorporated\n   - and updates anticipated to the related PS that updates IPv6.
    \ This\n   is therefore an interim version.  XXX\n\n\t </p>\n      "
