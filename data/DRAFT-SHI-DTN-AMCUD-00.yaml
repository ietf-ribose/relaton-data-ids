abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with
    the\n   unpredictable disruption problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks\n   (DTN)
    [RFC4838]. Since Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)\n   [RFC5326] provides
    retransmission-based reliability for bundles,\n   several times of retransmissions
    can be seen as a failure occurred\n   over links. The proposed mechanism is used
    to direct the following\n   packets to other nodes and probes the availability
    of the links\n   which has disrupted unexpectedly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
