abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering
    (TE)\nLabel Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nand
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where\na domain is
    referred to as a collection of network elements within a\ncommon sphere of address
    management or path computational\nresponsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous
    Systems) has been\nidentified as a key requirement .  This document specifies
    a\nprocedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements\n(PCEs)
    in order to compute such inter-domain shortest constraint\npaths along a determined
    sequence of domains, using a backward\nrecursive path computation technique while
    preserving confidentiality\nacross domains, which is sometimes required when domains
    are managed\nby different Service Providers.\n\t </p>\n      "
