abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated
    Services\n   (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-\n
    \  time network communication, including communication based on the\n   Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ is based on network\n   nodes applying different
    forwarding treatments to packets whose IP\n   headers are marked with different
    DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs).\n   WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing
    applications, have\n   begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle
    negotiation\n   mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS\n
    \  requirements using the same network 5-tuple.  The results of using\n   multiple
    DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single\n   network 5-tuple (e.g.,
    reordering) have transport protocol\n   interactions, particularly with congestion
    control functionality.  In\n   addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed
    between the traffic\n   source and destination.  This memo covers the implications
    of these\n   DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including\n
    \  WebRTC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
