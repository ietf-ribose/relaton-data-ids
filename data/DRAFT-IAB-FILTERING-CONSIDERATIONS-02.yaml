abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.
    \ This\n   openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n
    \  it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by\n   certain
    parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms\n   to limit the
    extent and impact of abusive or allegedly illegal\n   communications.  Recently,
    there has been an increasing emphasis on\n   \"blocking\" and \"filtering,\" the
    active prevention of such\n   communications.  This document examines several
    technical approaches\n   to Internet content blocking and filtering in terms of
    their\n   alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the\n
    \  approach to content blocking and filtering that is most coherent with\n   the
    Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially\n   undesirable
    services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in\n   abusive or illegal
    communications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
