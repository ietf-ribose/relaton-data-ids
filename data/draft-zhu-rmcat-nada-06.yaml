abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) is a novel congestion control
    scheme for interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing.
    In NADA, the sender regulates its sending rate based on either implicit or explicit
    congestion signaling in a consistent manner. As one example of explicit signaling,
    NADA can benefit from explicit congestion notification (ECN) markings from network
    nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the absence of explicit
    signaling by reacting to queuing delay and packet loss. This document describes
    the overall system architecture for NADA, as well as recommended behavior at the
    sender and the receiver.</p>"
