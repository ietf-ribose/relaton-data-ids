abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely\n
    \  feedback to the sender.  Currently the sender has no means to verify\n   that
    a receiver is correctly sending this feedback according to the\n   protocol.  A
    receiver that is non-compliant has the potential to\n   disrupt a sender's resource
    allocation, increasing its transmission\n   rate on that connection which in turn
    could adversely affect the\n   network itself.  This document presents a two stage
    test process that\n   can be used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant.
    \ The\n   tests enshrine the principle that one shouldn't attribute to malice\n
    \  that which may be accidental.  The first stage test causes minimum\n   impact
    to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance.  The\n   second stage
    test can then be used to verify that the receiver is\n   non-compliant.  This
    specification does not modify the core TCP\n   protocol - the tests can either
    be implemented as a test suite or as\n   a stand-alone test through a simple modification
    to the sender\n   implementation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
