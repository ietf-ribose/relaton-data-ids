abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Certain application protocols are highly transactional and
    require\n   substantial care when dealing with latency.  Queries for versioning\n
    \  information are, in these circumstances, costly.  In addition, there\n   is
    a desire to allow for a means to specify a lightweight means to\n   alternative
    transport protocols, such as making use of SCTP instead\n   of TCP.  This memo
    specifies a new DNS RR with an eye toward the\n   least necessary roundtrips to
    determine various protocols, port\n   numbers, and options for a given service
    instance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
