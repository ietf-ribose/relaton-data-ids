abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves
    the\nutilization of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers,\nservers
    and links.  Virtual machines (VM) are allowed to migrate to\nany place in the
    Data Center.  A variety of policies (e.g.  ACL,\nfirewalls, load balancers, IPS
    and QoS) are deployed in Data Center\nto guarantee the SLA the provider signed
    with their clients.  Dynamic\ninformation, such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic
    ACLs and cumulated\ndata, is generated on network devices.  In order to keep running\nservices
    uninterrupted while VM migrating, relevant policies and\ndynamic information,
    also need to migrate with VM.\n\nThis document describes some examples of the
    policies and dynamic\ninformation that need to migrate with VM, the influence
    if they are\nnot migrated with VM, the problems that need to consider when migrate\npolices
    and dynamic information.  It also describes some existing\nnetwork management
    protocols standardized by IETF and the advantages\nand disadvantages of them for
    operating policies and dynamic\ninformation migration respectively.  The goal
    is to justify that it\nis necessary for IETF to make effort on policy and dynamic\ninformation
    migration for large virtualized Data Center.\n\t </p>\n      "
