abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely deployed application
    protocol for network management and in particular network monitoring. This document
    describe the applicability of SNMP to constrained devices, e.g., nodes in Low-power
    and Lossy Networks. We discuss SNMP implementation techniques and we provide deployment
    considerations. Our discussion also covers the applicability of MIB modules to
    constrained devices.</p>"
