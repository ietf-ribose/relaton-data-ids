abstract:
  content: "\t <t>L2TP provides layer-2 tunneling over long distances, and a single
    L2TPsession is likely to carry different type of IP packets. Currently, oneL2TP
    session carries only one payload session; for PPP session (payload)the LCP controls
    the corresponding L2TP session. Assigning one diffservcode point to a L2TP session,
    as mentioned in [ref-6] can not providedifferentiated services for the different
    kind of IP packets that aretunneled. For example, VoIP and FTP packets, will have
    to be treated thesame in the backbone, even though the intermediate nodes are
    diffservcapable.</p>"
