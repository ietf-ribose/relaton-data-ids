abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism of wVegas (weighted Vegas), which
    is a delay-based congestion control for MPTCP. The current congestion control
    algorithm of MPTCP, LIA, achieves only course- grained load balancing, since it
    is based on packet loss event. On the contrary, wVegas adopts packet queuing delay
    as congestion signals, thus achieving fine-grained load balancing. Compared with
    loss-based algorithms, wVegas is more sensitive to the changes of network congestion
    and thus achieves more timely traffic shifting and quicker convergence. WVegas
    has been implemented in the Linux Kernel and is part of the UCLouvain's MPTCP
    implementation now.</p>"
