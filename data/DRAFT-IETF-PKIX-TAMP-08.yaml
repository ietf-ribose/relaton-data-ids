abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a transport independent protocol for the
    management of trust anchors (TAs) and community identifiers stored in a trust
    anchor store.  The protocol makes use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),
    and a digital signature is used to provide integrity protection and data origin
    authentication.  The protocol can be used to manage trust anchor stores containing
    trust anchors represented as Certificate, TBSCertificate, or TrustAnchorInfo objects.
