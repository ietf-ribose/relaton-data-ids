abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Networks
    (MPLS and GMPLS are described in [RFC3031] and [RFC3945]). This document addresses
    the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS and GMPLS. It describes
    the security threats, the related defensive techniques, and the mechanisms for
    detection and reporting. This document gives emphasis to RSVP-TE and LDP security
    considerations, as well as Inter-AS and Inter-provider security considerations
    for building and maintaining MPLS and GMPLS networks across different domains
    or different Service Providers.</p>"
