abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to a domain,
    represented by a Registrar, using an intermediary node between Pledge and Registrar.
    This intermediary node is known as a "constrained Join Proxy". An enrolled Pledge
    can act as a Join Proxy. This document extends the work of Bootstrapping Remote
    Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) by replacing the Circuit-proxy between Pledge
    and Registrar by a stateless/stateful constrained Join Proxy. It relays join traffic
    from the Pledge to the Registrar.</p>
