abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol RFC2960 [5] provides transparentmulti-homing
    to its upper layer users. This multi-homing isaccomplished through the passing
    of address parameters in the initialsetup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network
    addresses SHOULD NOTbe passed without consideration of their routeablility. Thisdocument
    defines considerations and enumerates general rules that anSCTP endpoint MUST
    use in formulating both the INIT and INIT-ACKchunks when including IPv4 addresses.</p>"
