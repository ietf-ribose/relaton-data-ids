abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses handover decision criteria for avoiding\n
    \  deterioration in communication quality during WLAN handover, in\n   particular
    at handover initiation.  We first describe problems for\n   handover decision
    criteria employed by existing mobility management\n   technologies, such as Mobile
    IP and mSCTP.  We then propose the\n   number of frame retransmissions as a simple
    heuristic for handover\n   decisions and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.
    \ \n   In addition, we introduce our proposed method using the number \n   of
    frame retransmissions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
