abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and
    SYN-ACK\n   packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial\n   connection
    handshake, thus saving up to one full round trip time\n   (RTT) compared to the
    standard TCP, which requires a three-way\n   handshake (3WHS) to complete before
    data can be exchanged. However\n   TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics;
    the data in the SYN\n   could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.\n
    \  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue\n   detailed
    in the Applicability section.\n\nTerminology\n\t </p>\n      "
