abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It has often been the case that manageability considerations
    have\n   been retrofitted to protocols. This is sub-optimal.\n\n   Similarly,
    new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently\n   designed without due consideration
    of manageability requirements.\n\n   This document specifies the requirement for
    all new Routing Area\n   Internet-Drafts to include an \"Manageability Considerations\"
    section,\n   and gives guidance on what that section should contain.\n\t </p>\n
