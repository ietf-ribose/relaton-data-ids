abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the micromobility problem, and is an attempt
    to enumerate some of the concepts and approaches defining micromobility. A set
    of concepts is defined for discussing the problem, and approaches taken to solve
    related problems are examined. At end, a discussion applying the concepts aims
    at giving input to decide if the problem area would benefit from further work.</p>"
