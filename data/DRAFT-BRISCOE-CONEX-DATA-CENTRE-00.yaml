abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how a multi-tenant data centre operator
    can\n   isolate tenants from network performance degradation due to each\n   other's
    usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN-\n   style network
    where anyone can use any amount of any resource.  Zero\n   per-tenant configuration
    and no implementation change is required on\n   network equipment.  Instead the
    solution is implemented with a simple\n   change to the hypervisor (or container)
    on each physical server,\n   beneath the tenant's virtual machines.  These collectively
    enforce a\n   very simple distributed contract - a single network allowance that\n
    \  each tenant can allocate among their virtual machines.  The solution\n   is
    simplest and most efficient using layer-3 switches that support\n   explicit congestion
    notification (ECN) and if the sending operating\n   system supports congestion
    exposure (ConEx).  Nonetheless, an\n   arrangement is described so that the operator
    can unilaterally deploy\n   a complete solution while operating systems are being
    incrementally\n   upgraded to support ConEx.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
