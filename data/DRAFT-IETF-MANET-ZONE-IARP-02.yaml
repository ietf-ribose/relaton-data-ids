abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP),
    a\nlimited scope proactive routing protocol used to improve the\nperformance of
    existing globally reactive routing protocols.  With\neach node monitoring changes
    in its surrounding R-hop neighborhood\n(routing zone), global route discoveries
    to local destinations can be\navoided.  When a global route search is needed,
    the IARP's routing\nzones can be used to efficiently guide route queries outwards
    (via\nbordercasting) rather than blindly relaying queries from neighbor\nto neighbor.
    \ The proactive maintenance of routing zones also helps\nimprove the quality of
    discovered routes, by making them more robust\nto changes in network topology.
    \ Once routes have been discovered,\nIARP's routing zone offers enhanced, real-time,
    route maintenance.\nLink failures can be bypassed by multiple hop paths within
    the\nrouting zone.  Similarly, suboptimal route segments can be identified\nand
    traffic re-routed along shorter paths.\n\t </p>\n      "
