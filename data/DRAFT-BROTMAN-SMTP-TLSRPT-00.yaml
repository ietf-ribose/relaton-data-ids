abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels\n
    \  between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS [RFC3207], DANE\n   [RFC6698],
    and SMTP MTA STS (TODO: Add ref).  These protocols can\n   fail due to misconfiguration
    or active attack, leading to undelivered\n   messages or delivery over unencrypted
    or unauthenticated channels.\n   This document describes a reporting mechanism
    and format by which\n   sending systems can share statistics and specific information
    about\n   potential failures with recipient domains.  Recipient domains can\n
    \  then use this information to both detect potential attackers and\n   diagnose
    unintentional misconfigurations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
