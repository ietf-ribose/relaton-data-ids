abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers
    which\n   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.\n
    \  The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream-\n   attached
    hosts and the upstream provider network, and can also act as\n   a host under
    the weak end system model.  This document considers the\n   case when the \"requesting
    router\" is actually a simple host, and\n   receives a delegated prefix that it
    can use for multi-addressing\n   purposes.  The host does not connect any downstream-attached\n
    \  networks, and uses the prefix solely for its own multi-addressing\n   purposes.\n\n\t
