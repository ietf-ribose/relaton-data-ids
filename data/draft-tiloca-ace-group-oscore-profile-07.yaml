abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework. The profile uses Group OSCORE to
    provide communication security between a Client and a (set of) Resource Server(s)
    as members of an OSCORE Group. The profile securely binds an OAuth 2.0 Access
    Token with the public key of the Client associated to the private key used in
    the OSCORE group. The profile uses Group OSCORE to achieve server authentication,
    as well as proof-of-possession for the Client's public key. Also, it provides
    proof of the Client's membership to the correct OSCORE group, by binding the Access
    Token to information from the Group OSCORE Security Context, thus allowing the
    Resource Server(s) to verify the Client's membership upon receiving a message
    protected with Group OSCORE from the Client.</p>"
