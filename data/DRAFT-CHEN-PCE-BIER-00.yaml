abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-\n   flow state.  BIER
    forwards and replicates packets based on a\n   BitString in the packet header.A
    BIER Path can be derived from a\n   variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest
    Path Tree (SPT),\n   explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n
    \  This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element\n   Protocol
    (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation\n   of paths for BIER
    TE LSPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
