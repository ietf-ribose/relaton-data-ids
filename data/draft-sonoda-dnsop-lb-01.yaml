abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new DNS load balance function that is able to
    transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing. DNS base load
    balance is popular technology. It provides weight base response and location base
    response. It have become an indispensable part of traffic engineering. However,
    DNS base load balance can't transfer load balance information in zone transfer
    and need online singing because it is not standardized. This document defines
    a new DNS resource record called "LB". LB RR provides the balancing information
    weight, location and target domain name.</p>
