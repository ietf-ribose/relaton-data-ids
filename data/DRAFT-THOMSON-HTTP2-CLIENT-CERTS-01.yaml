abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require\n
    \  additional authentication to interact with.  HTTP/1.1 servers rely on\n   TLS
    renegotiation that is triggered by a request to a protected\n   resource.  HTTP/2
    made this pattern impossible by forbidding the use\n   of TLS renegotiation.  While
    TLS 1.3 provides an alternate mechanism\n   to obtain client certificates, this
    mechanism does not map well to\n   usage in TLS 1.2.\n\n   This document describes
    a how client authentication might be\n   requested by a server as a result of
    receiving a request to a\n   protected resource.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
