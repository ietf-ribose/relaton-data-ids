abstract:
- content: <p>In some contexts it is useful for holders of the private and public
    parts of an elliptic curve key pair to be able to independently apply an updates
    to those values, such that the resulting updated public key corresponds to the
    updated private key. Such updates are straightforward for older elliptic curves,
    but for X25519 and X448, the "clamping" prescribed for scalars requires some additional
    processing. This document defines a multiplication procedure that can be used
    to update X25519 and X448 key pairs. This algorithm can fail to produce a result,
    but only with negligible probability. Failures can be detected by the holder of
    the private key.</p>
