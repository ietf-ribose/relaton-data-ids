abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the integration of Dynamic Automated Metadata
    Exchange (DAME) through an intermediate trusted third party into the Security
    Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile. The user-triggered,
    on-demand, and fully automated metadata exchange between identity provider (IDP)
    and service provider (SP) is intended for scenarios in which the a-priori, e.g.,
    federation-based exchange of SAML metadata is neither practical, scalable nor
    mandatory for non-technical aspects, such as contract-based trust building between
    IDP and SP. The main benefit of DAME is the removal of waiting times for users
    and manual setup tasks for IDP and SP administrators before users can access the
    service. Implementations of DAME can leverage existing metadata repositories,
    such as REEP, and metadata transfer protocols, such as MD Query.</p>"
