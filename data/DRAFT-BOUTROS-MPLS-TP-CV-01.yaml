abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies method for verifying the connection of
    an \n   MPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for \n   management
    purpose. The proposed extension is based on MPLS \n   Operation, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM). The goal is to \n   verify that an MPLS-TP is properly
    setup in both control and data \n   planes, as well as to record the identities
    of all the LSRs along the \n   path of MPLS-TP LSP. \n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
