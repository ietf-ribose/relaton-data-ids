abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with
    EVPN\n   control plane is defined as part of RFC 7432.  EVPN has since evolved\n
    \  to find wider applicability across various IRB use cases that include\n   distributing
    both MAC and IP reachability via a common EVPN control\n   plane.  MAC Mobility
    procedures defined in RFC 7432 are extensible to\n   IRB use cases if a fixed
    1:1 mapping between VM IP and MAC is assumed\n   across VM moves.  Generic mobility
    support for IP and MAC that allows\n   these bindings to change across moves is
    required to support a\n   broader set of EVPN IRB use cases, and requires further\n
    \  consideration.  EVPN all-active multi-homing further introduces\n   scenarios
    that require additional consideration from mobility\n   perspective.  This document
    enumerates a set of design considerations\n   applicable to mobility across these
    EVPN IRB use cases and defines\n   generic sequence number assignment procedures
    to address these IRB\n   use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
