abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [This version of the document is a draft version for an RFC6044bis\n
    \  that will describe the mapping between the Diversion header defined\n   in
    RFC5806 and the new History-Info header defined in RFC7044.]\n   Although the
    SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF,\n   the non-standard
    Diversion header is nevertheless already implemented\n   and used for conveying
    call diversion related information in the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    signaling.\n   This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between\n
    \  the Diversion header and the History-Info header to handle call\n   diversion
    information.  In addition, an interworking policy is\n   proposed to manage the
    headers' coexistence.  The non-standard\n   Diversion header is described, as
    Historic, in [RFC5806].  The\n   History-Info header is described in [RFC7044]
    that obsoletes\n   [RFC4244] initially describing the History-Info header.  [RFC7044]\n
    \  defines an optional SIP header field, History-Info, for capturing the\n   history
    information in requests and SIP header field parameters for\n   the History-Info
    and Contact header fields to tag the method by which\n   the target of a request
    is determined.  RFC7044 also defines a value\n   for the Privacy header field
    that directs the anonymization of values\n   in the History-Info header field.\n\n
    \  Since the Diversion header is used in existing network\n   implementations
    for the transport of call diversion information, its\n   interworking with the
    SIP History-Info standardized solution is\n   needed.  This work is intended to
    enable the migration from non-\n   standard implementations and deployment toward
    IETF specification-\n   based implementations and deployment.\n   This document
    obsoletes [RFC6044].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
