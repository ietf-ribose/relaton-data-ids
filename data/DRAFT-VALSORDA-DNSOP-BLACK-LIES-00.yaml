abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a technique to generate valid DNSSEC
    answers\n   on demand for non-existing names by claiming the name exists and\n
    \  returning a NSEC record for it.  These answers require only one NSEC\n   record
    and allow live-signing servers to minimize signing operations,\n   packet size,
    disclosure of zone contents and required knowledge of\n   the zone layout.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
