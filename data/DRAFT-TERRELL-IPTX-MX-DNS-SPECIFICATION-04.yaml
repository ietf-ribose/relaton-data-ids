abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n  This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Domain
    Name\n  Service' (IPtX / IPtX-MX DNS), and eliminates the possibility of an\n
    \ Addressing 'Conflict', or a Mathematical Addressing Error in the\n  IPtX Address
    Space when using Multiple IPtX Addressing Formats. In\n  other words, the IPtX
    / IPtX-MX IP Addressing format on the\n  \"Back-End\", or \"Backbone\", obtains
    its uniqueness through the use\n  and / or difference defined by the accuracy
    of the 'Exponential\n  Decimal String'. However, this uniqueness, if not clarified,
    would\n  not be discernable on the \"Front-End\", because the IPtX IP\n  Addressing
    Specification 'Allows' only a '48' Bit-Mapped IP Address,\n  or 2 Octets and 4
    '10 Bit-Quadrants', and up to 60 Bits for every IP\n  Addressing Format greater
    than IPt1. That is, on the \"Front-End\", if\n  there is No distinction, because
    every Addressing Format in the IPtX\n  Specification, when Resolved, is Equal,
    there will ultimately be\n  Address Conflicts within the Addressing Scheme. Nevertheless,
    this\n  clarification, when used in conjunction with the IPtX 32 / 64\n  Bit Header,
    allows the simultaneous use of (2E24) 16,777,216\n  different IPtX / IPtX-MX IP
    Addressing Specifications; the\n  Concurrent use of the IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing
    Specifications\n  'IPt1' thru 'IPt16,777,216'.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
