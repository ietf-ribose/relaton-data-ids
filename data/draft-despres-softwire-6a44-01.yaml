abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Most CPEs should soon be dual stack, but a large installed base
    ofIPv4-only CPEs is likely to remain for several years. Also, with theIPv4 address
    shortage, more and more ISPs will assign private IPv4addresses to their customers.
    The need for IPv6 connectivitytherefore concerns hosts behind IPv4-only CPEs,
    including such CPEsthat are assigned private addresses. The 6a44 mechanism specified
    inthis document addresses this need, without limitations andoperational complexities
    of Tunnel Brokers and Teredo to do the same.6a44 is based on an address mapping
    and on a mechanism wherebysuitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6
    connectivity viaa stateless 6a44 server function operated by their Internet ServiceProvider.
    With it, IPv6 traffic between two 6a44 hosts in a singlesite remains within the
    site. Except for IANA numbers that remain tobe assigned, the specification is
    intended to be complete enough forrunning codes to be independently written and
    interwork.</p>"
