abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents extensions to IP that enable the use of source-based\ndistribution
    trees (such as those established by DVMRP[1] or PIM-DM[2])\nto deliver multicast
    packets generated by members of a multicast group\nin the opposite direction to
    packets originated by the source (S).\nPackets generated by a member M of a group
    G are forwarded (unicast)\nfrom an in-tree router to another, towards the source
    S.\nIn addition to send the packet to its upstream, each in-tree router \ninjects
    it into the multicast tree (S,G). This enables packets to reach \nthe rest of
    the receivers, as S would originate them.\nThe 'reversed' use of the distribution
    tree is intended for sending of\nlow volume feedback information produced by receivers
    in applications\nsuch as RTP/RTCP[3] and reliable multicast.\nThis feature diminish
    the overhead in routers in case of applications\nwith a source and many receivers
    sending feedback, because only one\ndistribution tree, rooted at the sender S
    must be maintained, in place\nof one per member.\nIn addition, multicast packets
    originated by receivers,travel through\nthe inverse path of information ones in
    the distribution tree.\nThis can be exploited by multicast transport protocols
    to localize\nprocesses to subtrees or to reduce exposure. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
