abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines extensions for HIP mobility and multihomingmechanisms
    to operate in network environments with NAT devices. Theextensions are based on
    the ICE protocol that allows twocommunicating end-hosts to establish a direct
    communications pathwith each other even when residing in separate private addressrealms.
    The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault-tolerance with symmetric
    locator pairs, and load-balancing is alsodiscussed. This document also updates
    RFC5206.</p>"
