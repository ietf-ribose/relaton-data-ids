abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS)\n
    \  servers to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are\n   delegated.
    \ Queries for names within those zones have no useful\n   responses in a global
    context.  The purpose of this project is to\n   reduce the load of such junk queries
    on the authoritative name\n   servers that would otherwise receive them, and instead
    direct the\n   load to name servers operated within the AS112 project.\n\n   Due
    to the loosely-coordinated nature of the project, adding and\n   dropping zones
    from the AS112 servers is difficult.  This document\n   proposes a mechanism by
    which AS112 name servers could answer\n   authoritatively for all possible zones.
    \ This eliminates the add/drop\n   problem, changing it to a matter of delegation
    within the DNS and\n   requiring no operational changes on the servers themselves.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC 6304.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
