abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an infrastructure that\n
    \  facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between\n   multiple
    user devices and provides end-to-end security.  This\n   document describes the
    cryptographic algorithm suites used in the\n   Mesh and the implementation of
    Multi-Party Encryption and Multi-Party\n   Key Generation used in the Mesh.\n\n
