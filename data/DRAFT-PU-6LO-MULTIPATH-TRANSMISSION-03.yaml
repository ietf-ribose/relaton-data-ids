abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a multipath transmission method for
    6LoWPAN\n   Networks, which can effectively provide the transmission redundancy\n
    \  for packets. It is suitable for high-reliability networks,\n   especially for
    IPv6-based industrial wireless scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
