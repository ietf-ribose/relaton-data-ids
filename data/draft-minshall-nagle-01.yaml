abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Nagle algorithm is one of the primary mechanisms which protectsthe
    internet from poorly designed and/or implemented applications.However, for a certain
    class of applications (notably,request-response protocols) the Nagle algorithm
    interacts poorlywith delayed acknowledgements to give these applications poorerperformance.This
    draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should disablethe Nagle algorithm.
    This draft suggests a fairly small and simple modification to the Nagle algorithm
    to preserve Nagle as a means of protecting the internet while at the same time
    giving better performance to a wider class of applications.</p>"
