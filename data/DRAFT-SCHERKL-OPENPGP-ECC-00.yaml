abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines which algorithm specific parameters are
    needed\nfor elliptic curve cipher (ECC) and elliptic curve digital signature\nalgorithm
    (ECDSA) and how they have to be stored in openPGP packets.\nTherefore it is an
    supplement to the openPGP message format [1].\nIt also defines which checks are
    needed to validate ECC and ECDSA\nkeys and which 'top-level' operations must be
    performed for\nencryption/decryption and signing/signature verification. But it\ngives
    no advices how to implement these checks and operations, nor\nthe underlying mathematics.
    To do this, look for example at IEEE\nP1363 [2].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
