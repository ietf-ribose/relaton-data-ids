abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL routing can be extended to support multiple levels by
    building\n   on the multilevel feature of IS-IS routing. Depending on how\n   nicknames
    are managed, there are two primary alternatives to realize\n   TRILL multilevel:
    the unique nickname approach and the aggregated\n   nickname approach as discussed
    in [MultiL]. This document specifies\n   the unique nickname approach. This approach
    gives unique nicknames to\n   all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
