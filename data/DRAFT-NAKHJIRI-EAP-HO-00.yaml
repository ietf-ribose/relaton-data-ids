abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current EAP documentation set, such as [EAP3748], [EAPKEY6],
    and \n   [RADEAP3579] provide a powerful framework for performing combined \n
    \  authentication and key management using an EAP server and an AAA \n   infrastructure.
    The framework competently deals with many issues \n   related to network-access
    control and link security setup. However, \n   when it comes to deploying these
    specifications for mobile wireless \n   environments, where a peer is required
    to perform fast and/or \n   heterogeneous handovers, the current framework can
    be extended with \n   more clear guidelines and possibly specifications in ways
    that \n   prevent interoperability or security issues. This draft intends to \n
    \  explore some of the complications in deploying the EAP framework for \n   handovers
    and analyze a few solution alternatives.  \n    \n   Further threat analysis of
    each alternative or providing trade-off \n   guidelines for support of handover
    may be part of the future \n   revisions of this document.  \n\t </p>\n      "
