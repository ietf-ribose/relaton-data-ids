abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enablesreceiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIPuser agents. This framework
    defines the procedures for creating,refreshing and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching andperiodic polling of resource state. These procedures have
    a seriousdeficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying eventnotifications
    that have already been received by a user agent. Thismemo defines an extension
    to SIP events that allows the subscriber tocondition the subscription request
    to whether the state has changedsince the previous notification was received.
    When such a conditionis true, either the body of a resulting event notification
    or theentire notification message is suppressed.</p>"
