abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures to support node protection
    for\n   unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) established by Label Distribution\n
    \  Protocol (LDP).  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local\n   Repair
    (PLR) of N must discover the Merge Points (MPs) of node N such\n   that traffic
    can be redirected to them in case of node N failure.\n   Redirecting the traffic
    around the failed node N depends on existing\n   point-to-point LSPs originated
    from the PLR to the MPs while\n   bypassing the protected node N.  The procedures
    described in this\n   document are topology independent in a sense that they provide
    node\n   protection in any topology.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
