- content: "<p>There have been several proposed solutions with BIER being used in
    IPv6. But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and lists the
    requirements. The goal of this document is to describe the general BIER IPv6 encapsulation
    problem and detail solution requirements, thereby assisting the working group
    in the development of acceptable solutions.</p>"
