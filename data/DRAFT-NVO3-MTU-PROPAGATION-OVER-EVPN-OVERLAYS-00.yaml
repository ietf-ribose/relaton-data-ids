abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Path MTU Discovery between end-host-devices/Virtual-Machines/servers/\n
    \  workloads connected over an EVPN-Overlay Network in an\n   Datacenter/Campus/enterprise
    deployment, is a problem, yet to be\n   resolved in the standards forums.  It
    needs a converged solution to\n   ensure optimal usage of network and computational
    resources of the\n   underlay routers/switches forming the basis of the overlay
    network.\n   There is concerted guidelines presented in [RFC4459].\n\n   The overlay
    connectivity can pan across various sites (geographically\n   seperated or collocated)
    for realizing a Datacenter Interconnect or\n   intersite VPNs between campus sites
    (buildings, branch offices etc).\n\n   This literature intends to solve problem
    of icmp error propagation\n   from an underlay routing/switching device to an
    end-host (hooked to\n   EVPN overlay), thus facilitating \"accurate MTU\" learnings.\n\n\t
