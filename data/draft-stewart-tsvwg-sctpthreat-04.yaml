- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol RFC2960 [2] is a multi-homed transport
    protocol. As such, unique security threats exists that are addressed in various
    ways within the protocol itself. This document attempts to detail the known security
    threats and there countermeasures as detailed in the current version of the SCTP
    Implementors guide (SCTP-IG). It is hoped that this information will provide some
    useful background information for many of the newest requirements spelled out
    in the SCTP-IG.</p>"
