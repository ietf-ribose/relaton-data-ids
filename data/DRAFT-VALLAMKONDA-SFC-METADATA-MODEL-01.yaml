abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various types of metadata are applicable to Service Function\n
    \  Chaining (SFC).  Metadata can be used for many purposes, such as\n   conveying
    processing information, resource usage, and flow specific\n   information, from
    prior nodes along the Service Function Path. It\n   can also be vendor specific
    to leverage vendor capabilities and hint\n   to downstream Service functions dynamically
    for improved\n   performance. In contrast, metadata carried out of band introduces\n
    \  latency and overhead with inefficiency and non-synchronous to real-\n   time
    traffic. A Service Function (SF) that needs to process the\n   information carried
    by the metadata may need detailed information of\n   the metadata structure carried
    by the packets and can have local\n   policies based on metadata.\n\n   The purpose
    of this document is to specify a framework and\n   information model on how to
    provision information about metadata\n   among classifiers and service functions
    on a service function chain.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
