abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPsec suite has been designed to secure communication between
    two\nnodes.  Security is performed at the network layer, and there are\nalmost
    no interactions between applications and the IPsec layer.  The\nmain motivation
    of this API is to enable any applications to interact\nwith the IPsec layer and
    to take advantage of the security deployed\nin IPsec suite.  This draft lists
    applications requirements with\nregard to the IPsec suite, and we tried not to
    limit the requirements\nto today's application requirements, but also to consider
    future\napplications' requirements.  Applications are associated to different\nprivileges,
    and IPsec layer MUST be protected from nasty IPsec\nmanipulations.  This draft
    is not considering applications privileges\nmanagement.  This draft lists any
    possible requirements on the IPsec\nlayer an application might require.\n\t </p>\n
