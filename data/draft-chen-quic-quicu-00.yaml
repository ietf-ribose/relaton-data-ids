abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC Unreliable (QUICU) is an extension of the QUIC protocol for unreliable
    data transmission, mainly through the definition and use of three new types of
    frames, namely the Expire Offset Frame, Boundary Frame, and Correlation Frame.
    The main purpose of this extension is to reduce data delivery delay. Through controlling
    the timing and scope of packet losses, QUICU reduces useless transmission to improve
    transmission efficiency, reduces head-of-line blocking to improve transmission
    timeliness, which are beneficial to delay- sensitive applications, especially
    audio and video applications. This document describes the motivation, the operations,
    and the wire formats of the three new types of frames.</p>"
