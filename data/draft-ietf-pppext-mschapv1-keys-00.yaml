abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
    fortransporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. The PPP Compression
    Control Protocol [2] provides a method to negotiateand utilize compression protocols
    over PPP encapsulated links. The Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication
    Protocol (MS-CHAP) [3]is a Microsoft-proprietary PPP authentication protocol,
    providing thefunctionality to which LAN-based users are accustomed while integratingthe
    encryption and hashing algorithms used on Windows networks. Microsoft Point to
    Point Encryption (MPPE) [4] is a means of represent-ing PPP packets in an encrypted
    form. MPPE uses the RSA RC4 [5]algorithm to provide data confidentiality. The
    length of the sessionkey to be used for initializing encryption tables can be
    negotiated.MPPE currently supports 40-bit and 128-bit session keys. MPPE sessionkeys
    are changed frequently; the exact frequency depends upon theoptions negotiated,
    but may be every packet. MPPE is negotiated withinoption 18 [6] in the Compression
    Control Protocol. This document describes the method used to derive the initial
    MPPE ses-sion keys from MS-CHAP credentials. The algorithm used to change ses-sion
    keys during a session is described in [4].</p>"
