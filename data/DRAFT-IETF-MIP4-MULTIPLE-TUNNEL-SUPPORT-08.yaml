abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines extensions to Mobile IP protocol
    for\n   allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of\n
    \  address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously\n   establish
    multiple IP tunnels with its home agent.  This essentially\n   allows the mobile
    node to utilize all the available network\n   interfaces and build an higher aggregated
    logical pipe with its home\n   agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore,
    these extensions\n   also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate
    flow\n   policies for binding individual traffic flows with the registered\n   care-of
    addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
