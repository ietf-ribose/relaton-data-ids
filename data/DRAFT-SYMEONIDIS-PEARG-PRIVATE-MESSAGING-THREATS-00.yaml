abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Modern email and instant messaging applications offer private\n
    \  communications between users.  As IM and Email network designs become\n   more
    similar, both share common concerns about security and privacy\n   of the information
    exchanged.  However, the solutions available to\n   mitigate these threats and
    to comply with the requirements may\n   differ.  The two communication methods
    are, in fact, built on\n   differing assumptions and technologies.  Assuming a
    scenario of\n   untrusted servers, we analyze threats against message delivery
    and\n   storage, the requirements that these systems need, and the solutions\n
    \  that exist in order to help implement secure and private messaging.\n   From
    the discussed technological challenges and requirements, we aim\n   to derive
    an open standard for private messaging.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
