abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a new response mode for RFC6749
    that uses\n   HTML5 Web Messaging (a.k.a window.postMessage()) instead of the\n
    \  redirect for the Authorization Response from the Authorization\n   Endpoint.
    \ It defines two modes: simple mode and relay mode.  Relay\n   mode can be used
    to protect the access token in the implicit grant\n   case by confining it within
    the origins of authorization server or\n   resource server and preventing it from
    being read by the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
