abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes a limited and well defined set of QoS PHBs and
    PHB groups to be applied at (inter)connections of two separately administered
    and operated networks. Many network providers operate Treatment Aggregate of different
    DiffServ classes. This draft offers a simple and constrained interconnection concept
    which may simplify operation and negotiation of DiffServ at interconnection points.</p>"
