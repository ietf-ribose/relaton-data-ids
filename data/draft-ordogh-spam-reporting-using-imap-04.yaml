abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an IMAP extension which allows a client to report
    spam by reference and allows an IMAP server to perform any action on the reported
    messages, including leaving the action at the client's discretion. In addition,
    this document discusses how an IMAP server can tap into spam aggregator services,
    ultimately allowing the IMAP server to improve its decision-making process. Conventions
    Used In This Document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client
    or the server, respectively.</p>
