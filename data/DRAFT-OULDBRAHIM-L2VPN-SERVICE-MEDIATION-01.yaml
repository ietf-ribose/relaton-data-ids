abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        [SWALLOW-IW] describes an approach for interworking a
    native \n        ATM SPVC segment with an ATM/FR-based pseudowire. The approach
    \n        requires that an ATM edge device to encode the remote MPLS \n        provider
    edge IP address within the NSAP destination address \n        per call-basis,
    and covers mostly ATM and FRF.8 specifications. \n        This draft covers other
    scenarios where a) the native layer-2 \n        edge doesnâ€™t have a priori knowledge
    of the remote PE IP \n        addresses, b) the Layer-2 Provider Edge and the
    layer-2 network \n        can be native Frame Relay (FR) using native layer-2
    signaling \n        protocols, c) the native layer-2 network can use not only
    NSAP \n        addressing but as well E.164, X.121, or any preferred native \n
    \       addressing scheme, and d) the interface between the MPLS/IP \n        network
    and native layer-2 network can be FRF.10/X.76 \n        interface. We refer to
    the above problem space as \"Service \n        Mediation\" to indicate that the
    native layer-2 signaling is \n        terminated at the MPLS/IP device attached
    to the layer-2 \n        network and the \"mediated\" service is an end-to-end
    connection \n        built from two segments: one segment is in its native layer-2
    \n        form which we denote as Native Wire (NW) established using \n        native
    layer-2 signaling protocols and the other segment is a \n        pseudowire (PW)
    established using PWE3/L2VPN signaling \n        protocols. \n\t </p>\n      "
