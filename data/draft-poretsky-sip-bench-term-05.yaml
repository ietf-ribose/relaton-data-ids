abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performancein
    networking devices. Terms are included for test components, testsetup parameters,
    and performance benchmark metrics for black-boxbenchmarking of SIP networking
    devices. The performance benchmarkmetrics are obtained for the SIP control plane
    and media plane. Theterms are intended for use in a companion methodology document
    forcomplete performance characterization of a device in a variety ofconditions
    making it possible to compare performance of differentdevices. It is critical
    to provide test setup parameters and amethodology document for SIP performance
    benchmarking because SIPallows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions
    thatcan influence performance benchmark measurements. It is necessary tohave terminology
    and methodology standards to ensure that reportedbenchmarks have consistent definition
    and were obtained following thesame procedures. Benchmarks can be applied to compare
    performance ofa variety of SIP networking devices.</p>"
