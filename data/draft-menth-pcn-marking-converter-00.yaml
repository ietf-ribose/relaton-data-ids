abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings
    ofa stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packetmarkings that
    correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based ona higher-rate. It may be
    applied in the PCN context to convertmarked admissible-rate-overload into marked
    supportable-rate-overload. This allows to perform marked flow termination whenpackets
    are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.</p>"
