abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In today's Internet, caching proxies that intermediate between\nHTTP
    (and increasingly streaming media) clients and servers\nprovide enhanced performance
    for Web page access. Both clients\nand servers are increasingly looking to the
    network for\nadditional services that can't be provided directly on the\nclient
    or server, and Web proxies are an attractive place for\nlocating these services.
    In fact, some such services (content\nassembly for advertising) are already being
    offered by Web\nproxies for servers, but in a nonstandard way. This document\ndescribes
    the problem and solution requirements for a\nstandardized, open and extensible
    service environment on\ncaching proxies which enables them to provide general
    services\nthat mediate, modify, and monitor object requests and\nresponses. It
    introduces an architectural framework along with\na set of core requirements necessary
    to design standardized\nimplementations for this application domain, taking into\naccount
    relevant IETF RFCs and IETF work-in-progress. The\narchitecture and requirements
    described here are mindful of\nthe success of end-to-end nature of Internet client/server\ninteractions,
    and the consequences of the proposed\narchitectural changes on end-to-end semantics
    are discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
