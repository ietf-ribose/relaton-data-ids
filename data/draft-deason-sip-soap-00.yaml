abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to providean extremely generic and
    extensible framework through which SIPnodes can request additional services from
    remote nodes. Examples ofsuch nodes include SIP Network Servers, SIP User Agents,
    SIP/PSTNGateways, SIP/H.323 Gateways and SIP Enabled Application ServiceBrokers.
    It also a candidate for providing a remote procedure callmechanism for Call Processing
    Language (CPL) scripts [2] .This proposal is based upon a new SIP method, called
    SERVICE. TheSERVICE method can carry a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [3]message
    as it's payload. SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchangeof information in
    a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAPdefines a framework for encoding
    request and response messages inXML. Typically SOAP uses HTTP as a transport protocol
    but thisproposal enables SIP to be used instead.</p>"
