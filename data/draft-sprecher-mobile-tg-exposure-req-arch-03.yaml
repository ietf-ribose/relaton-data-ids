abstract:
- content: "<p>Rapidly-varying conditions in a cellular network can cause problems
    for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which in turn can degrade application
    performance. This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution
    principles. It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a mobile
    throughput guidance exposure mechanism that can be used to assist TCP in cellular
    networks, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced service delivery performance.
    The proposed mechanism can be applied to any content or TCP/IP based application
    content delivery. This document describes the applicability of the mechanism for
    Intelligent Video Acceleration over cellular networks.</p>"
