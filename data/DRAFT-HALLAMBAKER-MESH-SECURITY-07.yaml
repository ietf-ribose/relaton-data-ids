abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure\n
    \  infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and\n   credential
    data between multiple user devices.  The core protocols of\n   the Mesh are described
    with examples of common use cases and\n   reference data.\n\n   [Note to Readers]\n\n
    \  Discussion of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list\n   (mathmesh@ietf.org),
