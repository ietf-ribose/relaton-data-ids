abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the network slice (NS) subnet as a general\n
    \  management plane concept that augments a baseline YANG network slice\n   model
    with management attributes and operations enabling\n   interconnections (or stitching)
    between network slices.  The\n   description of NS subnet interconnections is
    technology agnostic, and\n   is not tied to a particular implementation of the
    interconnection in\n   data plane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
