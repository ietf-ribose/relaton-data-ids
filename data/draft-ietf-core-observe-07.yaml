abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time. This document specifies
    a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables a server to replicate a resource
    state to interested clients. The protocol follows a best-effort approach when
    transmitting new resource states to clients, and provides eventual consistency
    between the state observed by each client and the actual resource state.</p>"
