abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism for authentication of \nthe
    source of a stream of Real-Time Transport Protocol \n(RTP) packets.  The mechanism
    provides sender-specific \nauthentication, non-repudiation, and replay protection
    \nservices for both unicast and multicast RTP streams.  This \nmechanism is based
    upon the stream signing scheme of Wong \nand Lam [WL].  These authentication services
    extend the RTP\nprofile for audio and video conferences with minimal control \n[Schulzrinne96,
    Schulzrinne99].  Authentication covers all\nRTP payload types, and may be applied
    in conjunction with \nthe RTP confidentiality service.  Key management and \nnegotiation
    of the authentication mechanism parameters are\nnot addressed in this document.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
