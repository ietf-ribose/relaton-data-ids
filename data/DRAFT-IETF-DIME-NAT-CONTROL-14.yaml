abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures
    for\n   the Diameter Network address and port translation Control\n   Application.
    \ This Diameter application allows per endpoint control\n   of Network Address
    Translators and Network Address and Port\n   Translators, which are added to networks
    to cope with IPv4-address\n   space depletion.  This Diameter application allows
    external devices\n   to configure and manage a Network Address Translator device
    -\n   expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA and policy control\n   capabilities
    with a Network Address Translators and Network Address\n   and Port Translators
    control component.  These external devices can\n   be network elements in the
    data plane such as a Network Access\n   Server, or can be more centralized control
    plane devices such as AAA-\n   servers.  This Diameter application establishes
    a context to commonly\n   identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server,
    and a Network\n   Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator device.\n
    \  This includes, for example, the control of the total number of\n   Network
    Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a\n   specific Network
    Address Translator binding for a particular\n   endpoint.  In addition, it allows
    Network Address Translator devices\n   to provide information relevant to accounting
    purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
