abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service function chain is the definition of an ordered set
    of service\n   functions.  After instantiated, the service function path is created\n
    \  and the classified traffic is steered through the corresponding\n   service
    function path and then forwarded to the final destination.\n   This document tries
    to describe how to use IPv6 data plane and IPv6\n   extension headers to realize
    service function chain in IPv6 network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
