abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current Internet trends in several fields have brought some security\n
    \  concerns with regards to what will happen with the current security\n   paradigms
    and mechanisms.\n\n   This document analyzes two security paradigms, the network-based
    and\n   the host-based.  The former refers to what is being used nowadays out\n
    \  there and the latter is based on the distributed firewall concept\n   [2].\n\n
    \  From the point of view of these security concerns it is stated that\n   there
    is a problem that must be addressed.\n\n   Some insights are given with respect
    to the host-based security\n   paradigm.\n\t </p>\n      "
