abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) can be used to control
    a wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies, network elements
    and links may impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch
    connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range limitations on links.
    This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for general information
    elements representing connectivity and label constraints as well as label availability.
    It is intended that protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe
    how information is carried for specific uses.</p>"
