abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) has\ntraditionally
    been done using vendor-specific monitoring,\nconfiguration and control methods.
    \ Although some service monitoring\nplatforms can test the functionality of the
    DNS itself there is not a\ninteroperable way to manage (monitor, control and configure)
    the\ninternal aspects of a name server itself.\n\nThis document discusses the
    requirements of a management system for\nDNS name servers.  A management solution
    that is designed to manage\nthe DNS can use this document as a shopping list of
    needed features.\n\t </p>\n      "
