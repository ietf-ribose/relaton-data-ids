abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores applicability of Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM) and use case scenarios for different parts of the mobile network. DMM approaches
    and scenarios are divided into two cases: partially and fully distributed. For
    each case, benefits and issues are provided. It also refers to applicability of
    existing protocols and necessity of development of new protocols in order to provide
    a guideline for best suited solutions for the target architecture.</p>"
