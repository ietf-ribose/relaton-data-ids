abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require further\n
    \  configuration change detection procedures than more traditional fixed\n   hosts.
    \ DNA is defined as the process by which a host collects\n   appropriate information
    and detects the identity of its currently\n   attached link to ascertains the
    validity of its IP configuration.\n\t </p>\n      "
