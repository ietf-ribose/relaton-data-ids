abstract:
  content: "<p>For access network operators, accounting information are crucial:they
    provide information for billing and give an overview of thetraffic usage. This
    document defines the requirements for accountinginformation needed on Softwires.1.
    MotivationThe Softwires WG is working on a solution to bring IPvX connectivityover
    an IPvY network [RFC4925]. This solution may be deployed andmanaged by access
    network operators to provide for example IPvXcontinuity of service. Operators
    should then consider the Softwiressolution as an extension of their access network
    service.For operators, AAA [RFC2865] is the key feature for access networkdeployment:
    Authentication verifies user credentials, Authorizationensures access network
    integrity and Accounting provides informationfor billing and network management.
    Information from accountingusually includes measurements of in and out octets
    and packets[RFC2867].As an alternative access network, the Softwires solution
    shouldprovide similar AAA features. For instance accounting on thesoftwire should
    gives to the operator measurements of the trafficgenerated by the user using this
    access network. In a dual stack(IPvX and IPvY) network, the operator may want
    to manage informationabout the comparative usage of both protocols, for example
    forbilling purpose. When the softwire is used to access IPvX over IPvY,accounting
    information will be specific to IPvX. Operators should beable to differentiate
    for which version of IP such information arerelevant. This differentiation may
    become important if suchoperators offer a softwire solution for both IPvX over
    IPvY and IPvYover IPvX access networks.2. Study caseIn this section is given an
    example of IPv6 access over IPv4 networkwhich is similar to the Hub-and-Spokes
    problem stated in theSoftwires WG ([RFC4925]). The Point6box architecture uses
    L2TP[RFC2661] and PPP for IPv6 tunneling over IPv4 (see Figure 1).Radius manages
    AAA parameters for the access network created by thetunnel. On the server side,
    PPP sends to RADIUS accountinginformation measuring the traffic generated by the
    customer./---------------------------\\ CPEv6| +--------------+ | DHCPv6 +-----+|

    statementThe accounting information defined for tunnels [RFC2867] includesattributes
    Acct-{Input,Output}-Octets and Acct-{Input,Output}-Packetsfor traffic measurements.
    These attributes do not depend of theversion of IP used by the monitored traffic.
    Operators may not beable to differenciate IPv4 from IPv6 traffic in their accountingstatistics.
    This non-differentiation even leads to mis-usages: Inthe current PPP implementation
    from BSD, the values of theseattributes are only based on IPv4 statistics collected
    from IPCPprotocol. No statistics are collected for IPv6 from IPV6CP.This proposal
    should decide which attributes may be candidate for IP-version differentiation.
    In operating system MIBs, values for in/outoctets on a network interface are independent
    of the IP version.Having such values for each version may be usefull for monitoring
    andbilling purpose. However the differentiation is done for in/out IPv4and IPv6
    packets on a network interface. Operators can extract fromthese values some hints
    about the usage of each version of the IPprotocol but can not give quantitative
    report of bandwidth usage.</p>"
