abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The need for individual right to privacy and the need for law\n
    \  enforcement to be able to effectively investigate crime are sometimes\n   portrayed
    as being irreconcilably in direct conflict with each other.\n   Both needs are
    legitimate and ignoring the challenges presented by\n   areas of conflict will
    not make the problem go away.\n\n   The document presents a conceptual model that
    allows for both sets of\n   requirements to be met simultaneously.  The reason
    for this\n   publication is to show that, with some creative thinking, it is\n
    \  possible to identify win-win solutions that simultaneously achieve\n   both
    privacy and law enforcement goals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
