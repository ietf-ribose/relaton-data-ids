abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current Internet routing architecture does not provide for ascalable
    multi-homing solution. Scalability of the interdomainrouting architecture is already
    a problem and is expected to becomean even larger problem if millions of home
    users and smallbusinesses will start to use multi-homing technology in order toachieve
    redundancy and reliability that traditionally can only beprovided by BGP multi-homing.Authors
    believe that it is possible to solve the problems of end-users and small businesses
    with a multi-addressing mechanism andsource address selection mechanism instead
    of using the routingsystem.This draft proposes a setup that will allow us to try
    a multi-addressing solution. Instead of trying to solve the problems formore complex
    network setups, it was decided to go for a solutionthat covers most simple setups
    but that cover the majority of homeand small business networks. Authors believe
    that we can more easilyreach progress by starting with a simple solution that
    can later beextended to solve the issues of a larger class of users.</p>"
