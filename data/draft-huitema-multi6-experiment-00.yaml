abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Internet routing architecture does not provide for a scalable
    multi-homing solution. Scalability of the interdomain routing architecture is
    already a problem and is expected to become an even larger problem if millions
    of home users and small businesses will start to use multi-homing technology in
    order to achieve redundancy and reliability that traditionally can only be provided
    by BGP multi-homing. Authors believe that it is possible to solve the problems
    of end- users and small businesses with a multi-addressing mechanism and source
    address selection mechanism instead of using the routing system. This draft proposes
    a setup that will allow us to try a multi- addressing solution. Instead of trying
    to solve the problems for more complex network setups, it was decided to go for
    a solution that covers most simple setups but that cover the majority of home
    and small business networks. Authors believe that we can more easily reach progress
    by starting with a simple solution that can later be extended to solve the issues
    of a larger class of users.</p>"
