abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to
    determine\n   if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined bulk transport\n
    \  performance targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to key infrastructure,
    such as interconnects, to accurately\n   detect if any part of the infrastructure
    will prevent the full end-\n   to-end paths traversing them from meeting the specified
    target\n   performance.\n\n   The diagnostic tests consist of precomputed traffic
    patterns and\n   statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery.  The traffic\n
    \  patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n   over
    a long path but are constructed in such a way that they are\n   independent of
    the actual details of the subpath under test, end\n   systems or applications.
    \ Likewise the success criteria depends on\n   the packet delivery statistics
    of the subpath, as evaluated against a\n   protocol model applied to the target
    performance.  The success\n   criteria also does not depend on the details of
    the subpath,\n   endsystems or application.  This makes the measurements open
    loop,\n   eliminating most of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk\n
    \  transport metrics.\n\n   Model based metrics exhibit several important new
    properties not\n   present in other Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability
    to\n   reason about concatenated or overlapping subpaths.  The results are\n   vantage
    independent which is critical for supporting independent\n   validation of tests
    results from multiple Measurement Points.\n\n   This document does not define
    diagnostic tests directly, but provides\n   a framework for designing suites of
    diagnostics tests that are\n   tailored to confirming that infrastructure can
    meet the target\n   performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
