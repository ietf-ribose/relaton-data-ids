abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    and the\n   Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) transport protocols\n
    \  expose services to applications and how an application can configure\n   and
    use the features offered by the transport service.  The document\n   is intended
    as a contribution to the Transport Services (TAPS)\n   working group to assist
    in analysis of the UDP and UDP-Lite transport\n   interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
