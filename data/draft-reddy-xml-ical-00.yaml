abstract:
- content: "<p>The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope and diversity
    of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a simple and effective means
    for users to search, browse, retrieve, and publish information of their own available
    for others. Now that Web browsers and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet,
    it is worthwhile to use XML to encode calendar objects. The power and extensibility
    of XML allows us to represent calendar data objects as well-formed XML documents.
    ICAL is an existing standard format for representing calendar components. This
    draft explains how to represent calendar components in XML that are compatible
    and easily translatable to the iCAL format. Copyright (C) The Internet Society
