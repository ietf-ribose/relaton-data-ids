abstract:
- content: "<p>Hybrid key exchange refers to executing two independent key exchanges
    and feeding the two resulting shared secrets into a Pseudo Random Function (PRF),
    with the goal of deriving a secret which is as secure as the stronger of the two
    key exchanges. This document describes new hybrid key exchange schemes for the
    Transport Layer Security 1.2 (TLS) protocol. The key exchange schemes are based
    on combining Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with a post-quantum key encapsulation
    method (PQ KEM) using the existing TLS PRF.</p>"
