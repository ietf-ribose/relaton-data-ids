abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how the experimental IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
    and\n   Destinations Option types can concurrently support different\n   experimental
    options. This is accomplished by employing a format in\n   the Option Data for
    experimental option types. The format contains an\n   experiment identifier that
    indicates an experimental option contained\n   in the trailing Option Data. This
    approach is robust to experiments\n   that are not registered and to those that
    do not use this sharing\n   mechanism.  It is recommended for all new Destination
    and Hop-by-Hop\n   options that use experimental codepoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
