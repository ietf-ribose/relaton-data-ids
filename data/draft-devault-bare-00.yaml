abstract:
- content: "<p>The Binary Application Record Encoding (BARE) is a data format used
    to represent application records for storage or transmission between programs.
    BARE messages are concise and have a well-defined schema, and implementations
    may be simple and broadly compatible. A schema language is also provided to express
    message schemas out-of-band.</p>"
