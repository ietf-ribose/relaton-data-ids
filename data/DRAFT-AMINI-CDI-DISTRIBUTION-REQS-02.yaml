abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies requirements for interconnecting, or\npeering,
    the distribution systems of Content Networks (CN).\nDistribution internetworking
    requires advertising the capabilities\nof a CN offering distribution services,
    moving content from one CN\nto another, and signaling requirements for consistent
    storage and\ndelivery of content. This document does not address requirements
    for\ndirecting user agents to distributed content, nor for aggregating\naccess
    information for distributed content.\n\t </p>\n      "
