abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Both address families
    and their related protocol suites support multicast of the single-source and any-source
    varieties. During IPv6 transition, there will be scenarios where a backbone network
    running one IP address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP)
    will provide transit services to attached client networks running another IP address
    family (referred to as external IP or E-IP). It is expected that the I-IP backbone
    will offer unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks.
    Softwire Mesh is a solution providing E-IP unicast and multicast support across
    an I-IP backbone. This document describes the mechanism for supporting Internet-style
    multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwire mesh. We
    focus on IPv4- over-IPv6 scenario in this document, due to lack of real-world
    use cases for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.</p>"
