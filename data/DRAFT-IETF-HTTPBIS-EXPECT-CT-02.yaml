abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new HTTP header, named Expect-CT, that
    allows\n   web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed\n
    \  Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these\n   hosts.
    \ When configured in enforcement mode, user agents (UAs) will\n   remember that
    hosts expect SCTs and will refuse connections that do\n   not conform to the UA's
    Certificate Transparency policy.  When\n   configured in report-only mode, UAs
    will report the lack of valid\n   SCTs to a URI configured by the host, but will
    allow the connection.\n   By turning on Expect-CT, web host operators can discover\n
    \  misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency deployments and\n   ensure
    that misissued certificates accepted by UAs are discoverable\n   in Certificate
    Transparency logs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
