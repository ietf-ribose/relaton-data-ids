abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers flexibility
    to introduce new user and control plane function within the context of network
    slicing that allows greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous devices and applications.
    In this draft, we provide a short description of the proposed 5GC, followed by
    extensions to 5GC's control and user plane to support packet data unit (PDU) sessions
    from information-centric networks. The value of enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed
    using two service scenarios which include mobile edge computing and support for
    seamless mobility for ICN sessions.</p>"
