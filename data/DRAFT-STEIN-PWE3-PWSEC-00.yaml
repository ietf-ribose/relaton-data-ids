abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extension to the MPLS pseudowire
    format to\n   enhance pseudowire user-plane security.  The extension, called PWsec,\n
    \  provides confidentiality, data integrity, and source authentication.\n   The
    extension is based on the National Institute of Standards and\n   Technology (NIST)
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using the\n   Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
