  content: "\n\t <p>The great advance in telecommunications techniques to increase
    the \nlevel of reliability on the physical layer (Packet Loss) has made a \ntremendous
    contribution to the way higher layer protocols are designed \nnowadays. The High-Level
    Logical Link Control (HLLC) is intended for \nuse as a highly reliable and fast
    host-to-host protocol between hosts \ncurrent packet-switched computer communication
    networks.\n\nThis document describes the functions to be performed by the \nHigh-Level
    Logical Link Control, the program that implements it, and \nits interface to programs
    or users that require its services.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
