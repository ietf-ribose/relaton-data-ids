abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of a Dynamic Mesh VPN (DMVPN) is to allow IPsec/IKE Security
    Gateways administrators to configure the devices in a partial mesh (often a simple
    star topology called Hub-Spokes) and let the Security Gateways establish direct
    protected tunnels called Shortcut Tunnels. These Shortcut Tunnels are dynamically
    created when traffic flows and are protected by IPsec. To achieve this goal, this
    document extends NHRP ([RFC2332]) into a routing policy feed and integrates GRE
    tunneling with IKEv2 and IPsec to provide the necessary cryptographic security.</p>"
