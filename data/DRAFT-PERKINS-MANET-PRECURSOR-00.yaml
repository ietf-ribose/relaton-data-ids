abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol is intended
    for\n   use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks.  AODVv2\n   determines
    unicast routes among AODVv2 routers within the network in\n   an on-demand fashion,
    offering on-demand convergence in dynamic\n   topologies.  This document specifies
    a simple modification to AODVv2\n   (and possibly other reactive routing protocols)
    enabling faster\n   notifications to known sources of traffic upon determination
    that a\n   route for such traffic's destination has become invalid.\n\n\t </p>\n
