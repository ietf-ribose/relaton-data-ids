abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The first step of Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) (RFC 2845) is
    to\n   generate a shared secret and exchange it manually between a DNS\n   server
    and a host. This document, CGA-TSIG, proposes a possible way\n   to automate the
    now manual process for the authentication of a node\n   with a DNS server during
    the DNS Update process by using the same\n   parameters as are used in generating
    a secure address in IPv6\n   networks, i.e., Cryptographically Generated Addresses
    (CGA) (RFC\n   3972). CGA-TSIG facilitates this authentication process and reduces\n
    \  the time needed for DNS Updates. The current signature generation\n   process
    and verification mechanism in TSIG are thus replaced with\n   CGA. This algorithm
    is added, as an extension, to TSIG to eliminate\n   the human intervention needed
    for generation and exchange of keys\n   between a DNS server and a host when SEcure
    Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\n   (RFC 3971) is used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
