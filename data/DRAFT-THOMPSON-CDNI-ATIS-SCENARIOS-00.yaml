abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer
    of\nrequirements, standards, and specifications for Internet Protocol\nTelevision,
    or IPTV.  IIF has specified an architecture for Content\nOn Demand applications
    which was published as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTV\nContent on Demand (CoD) Service
    specification.  ATIS IIF is now\nworking on revision 2 of this document.  Revision
    2 of ATIS CoD\nspecification includes an additional work item called \"Internet\nSourced
    Content\" which includes \"off net delivery\".  Both Internet\nSourced Content
    and off net delivery will address scenarios that\ninclude delivery of content
    from a Content Service Provider through\nmultiple CDNs operated by different organizations
    to a user agent.\nThis document provides information on [ATIS-0800042], and the\nInternet
    Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases that are\nrelevant to CDNI.\n\nThe
    ATIS IIF architecture group focuses on developing architectures\nand prefers to
    reference existing protocols where ever possible.  If,\nand as, the IETF CDNI
    effort progresses, the ATIS IIF architecture\ngroup will be evaluating the protocols
    defined by the CDNI working\ngroup for inclusion in the CDN interconnect scenarios
    defined as part\nof the Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases.\n\nA
    goal of the present document is to illustrate the Internet Sourced\nContent and
    off net Delivery use cases defined in revision 2 of the\nATIS CoD architecture
    that are relevant to the IETF CDNI work.  It is\nhoped that these use cases can
    also be used to guide requirements for\nthe development of IETF CDNI protocols.\n\t
