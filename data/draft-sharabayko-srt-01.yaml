    is a user-level protocol over User Datagram Protocol and provides reliability
    and security optimized for low latency live video streaming, as well as generic
    bulk data transfer. For this, SRT introduces control packet extension, improved
    flow control, enhanced congestion control and a mechanism for data encryption.</p>"
