abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML document format forexchanging
    emergency alerts and public warnings. Differentorganizations issue alerts for
    specific geographic regions. TheLocation-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
    provides a way todiscover servers that distribute these alerts for a geographicalregion.
    This document defines the Service Uniform Resource Names(URN)s for warnings in
    the same way as they have been defined withRFC 5031 for citizen-to-authority emergency
    services. Additionally,this document suggests to use LoST for the discovery of
    serversdistributing alerts.</p>"
