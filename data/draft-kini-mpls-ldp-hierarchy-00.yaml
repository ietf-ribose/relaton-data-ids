abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to advertise mappings
    ofForwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) to labels. IP prefix FECs areused to setup
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) along routed paths. LDPadvertises label mappings for
    IP Prefix FECs that appear as routes inthe route table. As the number of FECs
    in the network increases thenumber of labels correspondingly increases. During
    certain failureconditions a large number of label mappings may have to be generatedand/or
    installed in the data plane. In this document we describe anLDP extension to advertise
    hierarchical label mappings. This helps toreduce the number of label mappings
    that are downloaded duringcertain failure conditions and hence improves convergence
    times.</p>"
