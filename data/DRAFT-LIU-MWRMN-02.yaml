abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This paper describes a cooperative communication method of\n
    \  theconverged multi-media wireless resource management network.It can\n   maximize
    the utilization of heterogeneous network resources and\n   optimize the access
    to wireless resources of the network in the form\n   of Mesh, which solves the
    problem of collaborative wireless resource\n   management in multi-media converged
    networks.  Through the overall\n   consideration of multi-media converged networks
    including wired\n   network, wireless network, broadband network, and narrowband
    network,\n   joint access control and resource scheduling for network devices
    with\n   different characteristics in heterogeneous networks are realized.\n\n\t
