abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n
    \  established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF\n   evolved
    in ways that required changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The purpose
    of this document is to document and describe\n   the IETF Administrative Support
    Activity, version 2 (IASA 2.0).  It\n   defines the roles and responsibilities
    of the IETF Administrative LLC\n   Board, the IETF Executive Director, and the
    Internet Society in the\n   fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards
    process.  It\n   also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF\n
    \  Administrative LLC Board.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333,
    and RFC 7691.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
