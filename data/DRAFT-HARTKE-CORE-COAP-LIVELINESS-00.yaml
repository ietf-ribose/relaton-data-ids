abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   with a simple mechanism for a client to determine the \"liveliness\"
    of\n   a request for which it is still expecting a response or a\n   notification,
    and with a mechanism to request the cancellation of\n   such a request.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
