abstract:
- content: "<p>This document first dicusses the use of locators and identifiers in
    mobility management architectures, and their implication on various anchorless
    properties. A new architecture is then proposed that is purely based on identifiers,
    and more specifically names as defined in Hybrid-ICN [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn].
    The document then focuses on two main cases: the end-point sends data (data producer)
    or the end-point receive data (data consumer). These two cases are taken into
    account entirely to provide anchorless mobility management in hICN.</p>"
