abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a profile for the use of X.509 Attribute
    Certificates in Internet Protocols. Attribute certificates may be used in a wide
    range of applications and environments covering a broad spectrum of interoperability
    goals and a broader spectrum of operational and assurance requirements. The goal
    of this document is to establish a common baseline for generic applications requiring
    broad interoperability as well as limited special purpose requirements. The profile
    places emphasis on attribute certificate support for Internet electronic mail,
    IPSec, and WWW security applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
