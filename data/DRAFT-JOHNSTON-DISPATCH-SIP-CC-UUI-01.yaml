abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User\nInformation
    Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed.  As\nnetworks move to SIP it is
    important that applications requiring this\ndata can continue to function in SIP
    networks as well as the ability\nto interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end
    transparency.\nThis document discusses requirements and approaches.  This extension\nwill
    also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing similar\nservices and interworking
    with ISDN services.  Example use cases\ninclude an exchange between two user agents,
    retargeting by a proxy,\nand redirection.  An example application is an Automatic
    Call\nDistributor (ACD) in a contact center.\n\t </p>\n      "
