abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Anonymity is less discussed in the IETF than for instance security\n
    \  [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973].  This can be attributed to the fact\n   anonymity
    is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing user data\n   is not of specific
    market interest.  It remains a fact that 'most\n   internet users would like to
    be anonymous online at least\n   occasionally' [Pew].\n\n   This document aims
    to break down the different meanings and\n   implications of anonymity on a mediated
    computer network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
