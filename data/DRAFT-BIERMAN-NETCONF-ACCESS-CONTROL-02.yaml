abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use
    with\nthe NETCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating\nenvironment,
    which promotes human usability and multi-vendor\ninteroperability.  There is a
    need for standard mechanisms to\nrestrict NETCONF protocol access for particular
    users to a pre-\nconfigured subset of all available NETCONF operations and content.\nThis
    document discusses requirements for a suitable access control\nmodel, and provides
    one solution which meets these requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
