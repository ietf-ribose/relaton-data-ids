abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.peng-teas-network-slicing] defines an unified TN-slice identifier,
    i.e., AII(administrative instance identifier) and related processing combined
    with Segment Routing technology, for the purpose of unified identification of
    topology, computing, storage resources, unified partition of L2 and L3 link resources,
    unified basis of underlay path selection within or between domains, and unified
    flow steering rule with SR policy color scheme. This document describes the ISIS
    extensions required to support Packet Network Slicing over IPv6 dataplane.</p>"
