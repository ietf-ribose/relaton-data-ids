abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange
    (HIP\n   DEX), a variant of the Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2).  The\n
    \  HIP DEX protocol design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed\n   cryptographic
    primitives by omitting public-key signatures and hash\n   functions.  In doing
    so, the main goal is to still deliver similar\n   security properties to HIPv2.\n\n
    \  The HIP DEX protocol is primarily designed for computation or memory-\n   constrained
    sensor/actuator devices.  Like HIPv2, it is expected to\n   be used together with
    a suitable security protocol such as the\n   Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)
    for the protection of upper layer\n   protocol data.  In addition, HIP DEX can
    also be used as a keying\n   mechanism for security primitives at the MAC layer,
    e.g., for IEEE\n   802.15.4 networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
