abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, connections created across the Internet have multiple options
    of how to communicate: address families, specific IP addresses, network attachments,
    and application and transport protocols. This document describes how an implementation
    can race multiple options during connection establishment, and expose this functionality
    through an API.</p>"
