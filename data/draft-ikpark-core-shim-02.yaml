abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines shim header for the transfer of CoAP messages
    over non-TCP/IP constrained networks. In this environment, IP and UDP or TCP are
    not used, so that additional shim header as a container for addresses of sender/receiver
    and the length of CoAP header and its payload is required.</p>"
