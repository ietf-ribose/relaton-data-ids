abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) is an authenticated encryption
    with\n   associated data (AEAD) block cipher mode based on EtM principle.  MGM\n
    \  is defined for use with 64-bit and 128-bit block ciphers.\n\n   MGM has been
    standardized in Russia.  It is used as an AEAD mode for\n   the GOST block cipher
    algorithms in many protocols, e.g.  TLS 1.3 and\n   IPsec.  This document provides
    a reference for MGM to enable review\n   of the mechanisms in use and to make
    MGM available for use with any\n   block cipher.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
