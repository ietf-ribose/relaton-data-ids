abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery\n
    \  mechanisms are relatively static and limited to explicit\n   configuration.
    \ These are usually under the administrative control of\n   the application or
    TURN service provider, and not the enterprise,\n   ISP, or the network in which
    the client is located.  Enterprises and\n   ISPs wishing to provide their own
    TURN servers need auto discovery\n   mechanisms that a TURN client could use with
    no or minimal\n   configuration.  This document describes three such mechanisms
    for\n   TURN server discovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
