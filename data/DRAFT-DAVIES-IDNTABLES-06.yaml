abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method of representing the domain
    name\n   registration policy for a zone administrator using Extensible Markup\n
    \  Language (XML).  These policies, known as \"Label Generation Rulesets\"\n   (LGRs),
    are particularly used for the implementation of\n   Internationalized Domain Names
    (IDNs).  The rulesets are used to\n   implement and share policy defining which
    labels and specific Unicode\n   code points are permitted for registrations, which
    alternative code\n   points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed
    on\n   labels containing those variants.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
