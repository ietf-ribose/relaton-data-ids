abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In RFC2779 [RFC2779] and RFC2778 [RFC2778], XMPP [RFC3920] clientis
    defined as \"PRINCIPALS are the people, groups, and/or softwarein the \"real world\"
    outside the system that use the system as ameans of coordination and communication.
    Considering thisdescription, it does not matter whether the user of end node ishuman
    or software. However, current specification of XMPP isexpected that there will
    be a human in front of the client. So,there is no consideration for looping the
    message between softwaresand processing message that human will not be able to
    react.Recently system and software are replying in return ofhuman. Moreover, by
    making client act like a human, new networkservice can be made. There are many
    of these called \"bots\"already, but there is a possibility which can aggregate
    or controlremote resources.By clarifying models of usage and problem, thisdocument
    aims to use XMPP in software-to-software andhuman-to-software models not only
    human-to-human model.</p>"
