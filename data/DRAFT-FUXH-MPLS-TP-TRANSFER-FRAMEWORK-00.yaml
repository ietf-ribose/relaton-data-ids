abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In MPLS-TP architecture, LSP and PW provisioning can be done either\nby
    Control Plane (CP) or Management Plane (MP).  The MPLS-TP control\nplane must
    provide a mechanism for dynamic ownership transfer of the\ncontrol of MPLS-TP
    transport paths from MP to CP and vice versa.\n[draft-bao-mpls-tp-path-transfer-reqs-00]
    defines requirement for\nMPLS-TP paths ownership transfer from MP to CP and vice
    versa.\n\nThis document provides a framework to allow the development of\nprotocol
    extensions to support the MPLS-TP paths ownership transfer\nbetween MP and CP
    and vice versa.\n\t </p>\n      "
