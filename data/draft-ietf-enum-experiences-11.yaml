abstract:
- content: <p>This document captures experiences in implementing systems based on
    the ENUM protocol and experiences of ENUM data that have been created by others.
    As such, it clarifies the ENUM and Dynamic Delegation Discovery System standards.
    Its aim is to help others by reporting both what is "out there" and potential
    pitfalls in interpreting the set of documents that specify the ENUM protocol.
    It does not revise the standards but is intended to provide technical input to
    future revisions of those documents. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
