abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft, we propose an Internet architecture consisting
    \nof large number private networks, individually connected to the \nInternet backbone
    via NAT-routers. Hosts within the same private \nnetwork can communicate with
    one another locally, and also with \nhosts in other networks via the Internet
    backbone. The routers in \neach private network maintain their own local routing
    state and \nrouters in the backbone maintain their own external routing state.
    \nMore specifically, the routers within a particular domain are not \ncognizant
    of routes outside that domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
