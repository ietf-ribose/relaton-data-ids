abstract:
- content: "<p>Using the one-way loss pattern metrics defined in RFC 3357, this document
    defines two new metrics Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received
    to provide a better understanding of the affects of packet loss at the application
    level. The statistic Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Seconds is derived from the above
    metrics to compute the affect of packet loss at the application level.</p>"
