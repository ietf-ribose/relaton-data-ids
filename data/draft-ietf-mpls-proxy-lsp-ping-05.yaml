abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol
    Label Switched Protocol (MPLS) Pings on Label Switched Paths. An MPLS Proxy Ping
    Request is sent to any Label Switching Router along a Label Switched Path. The
    primary motivations for this facility are first to limit the number of messages
    and related processing when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs,
    and second to enable tracing from leaf to leaf (or root).</p>"
