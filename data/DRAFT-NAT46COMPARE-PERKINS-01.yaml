abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have
    been\nproposed to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  These\nmethods
    are not all mutually exclusive, and we propose that IVI\n(along with its variants)
    along with SIPNAT may be considered\ntogether as a more complete solution for
    enabling access from today's\nIPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains.  This
    would likely have\nthe effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with
    such\naccess enablements there would be much reduced incentive for new\ndeployments
    to require IPv4 addressability.  As part of the\ndiscussion, we also include a
    comparison of the various techniques so\nthe relative trade-offs may be more easily
    understood.\n\t </p>\n      "
