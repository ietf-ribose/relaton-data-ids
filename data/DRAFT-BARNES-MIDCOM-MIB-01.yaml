abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes and defines the managed objects for dynamic
    \nconfiguration of middleboxes. The scope of the middleboxes to which \nthese
    managed objects apply is limited to NATs and Firewalls.  \nHowever, the MIB module
    as defined by this document is intended to \nprovide a baseline for the dynamic
    configuration of other types of \nmiddleboxes. The applicability of existing Management
    Information \nBase (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM requirements, framework and \nsemantics
    is described. Additional managed objects are defined to \nsatisfy the entirety
    of the MIDCOM requirements, framework and \nsemantics, providing a complete MIDCOM
    MIB for NATs and Firewalls to \nfully realize the requirements of the MIDCOM protocol.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
