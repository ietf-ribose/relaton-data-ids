abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document looks at a number of issues surrounding the need\n
    \  for network address translation (NAT) when IPsec is used to\n   create virtual
    private networks (NAT).  This document only\n   looks at simple VPNs.  That is
    VPNs consisting of a single\n   IPsec tunnel as compared to VPNs consisting of
    chained\n   and/or nested IPsec tunnels and/or transports.\n\t </p>\n      "
