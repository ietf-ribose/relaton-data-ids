abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption
    at the transport layer. It identifies in-network uses of transport layer header
    information. It then reviews the implications of developing end-to-end transport
    protocols that use encryption to provide confidentiality of the transport protocol
    header and expected implications of transport protocol design and network operation.
    Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics
    have been important to the design of current transport protocols, it also considers
    the impact on transport and application evolution.</p>"
