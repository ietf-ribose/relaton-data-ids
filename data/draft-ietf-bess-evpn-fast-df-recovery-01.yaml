abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution [RFC7432] describes
    DF election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments. These procedures are
    enhanced further in [RFC8584] by applying Highest Random Weight Algorithm for
    DF election in order to avoid DF status unnecessarily upon a failure. This draft
    makes further improvement to DF election procedures in [RFC8584] by providing
    two options for fast DF election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated
    with the multi-homing Ethernet Segment. This fast DF election is achieved independent
    of number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via
    a simple signaling between the recovered PE and each PE in the multi-homing group.</p>"
