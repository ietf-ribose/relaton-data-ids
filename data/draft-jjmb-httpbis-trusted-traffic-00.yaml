abstract:
- content: "<p>Current methods for managing traffic through content inspection tend
    to process all sessions similarly. Internet traffic examples like DDoS mitigation
    require all data to pass through one of a limited number of scrubbing centers,
    which create both natural choke points and the potential for widespread collateral
    damage should a center become overloaded. Similar issues exist with email SPAM
    and malware filtering, traffic shaping, etc. We propose a method to utilize existing
    HTTP and HTTPS protocols that enables destinations to temporarily confer trust
    on sources, and for trusted traffic to be routed and processed differently from
    untrusted traffic.</p>"
