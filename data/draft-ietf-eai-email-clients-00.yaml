    Email Address Internationalization (EAI) as outlined in RFC 4952. A number of
    interoperability cases between different versions of email components are reviewed.
    Recommendations are made to improve interoperability and usability and to minimize
    discrepancies between the display of composed and received email in different
    language environments.</p>"
