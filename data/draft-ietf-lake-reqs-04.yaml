    key exchange protocol for OSCORE. This draft has completed a working group last
    call (WGLC) in the LAKE working group. Post-WGLC, the requirements are considered
    sufficiently stable for the working group to proceed with its work. It is not
    currently planned to publish this draft as an RFC.</p>"
