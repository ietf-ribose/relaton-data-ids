abstract:
  content: "<p>This document surveys existing mechanisms in the Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP) for identifying and authenticating the source of a SIPrequest (or caller
    identification). It describes how identificationand authentication are not always
    end-to-end and the problems thatthis can lead to, particularly since media security
    based ontechniques such as DTLS-SRTP is dependent on end-to-end authenticatedidentification
    of parties.This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
