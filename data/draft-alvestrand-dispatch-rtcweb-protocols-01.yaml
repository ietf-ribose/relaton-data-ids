  content: "\t <t>This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suiteintended
    for use with real-time applications that can be deployed inbrowsers - \"real time
    communication on the Web\".It intends to serve as a starting and coordination
    point to make sureall the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable,
    andthat the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fullyspecified
    and on the right publication track.This work is an attempt to synthesize the input
    of many people, butmakes no claims to fully represent the views of any of them.
