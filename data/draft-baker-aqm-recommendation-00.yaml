abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning
    measures to improve and preserve Internet performance. It presents a strong recommendation
    for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management
    in routers, to improve the performance of today's Internet. It also urges a concerted
    effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of router mechanisms
    to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive to congestion
    notification.</p>"
