abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\nfor use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn
    particular, it defines a textual convention for doing Diffie-\nHellman key agreement
    key exchanges and a set of objects which extend\nthe usmUserTable to permit the
    use of a DH key exchange in addition\nto the key change method described in [14].
    \ In other words, this MIB\nadds the possibility of forward secrecy to the USM
    model.  It also\ndefines a set of objects that can be used to kick start security
    on\nan SNMPv3 agent when the out of band path is authenticated, but not\nnecessarily
    private or confidential.\nThe author is submitting this draft at the request of
    the O&amp;M area\ndirector.  This memo revises and updates RFC 2786 [19] with
    the goal\nof moving the described protocol and MIB from Experimental to\nStandards
    Track.  The one minor substantive change from the\nExperimental RFC is a restatement
    of the conditions on the selection\nof the DH public number (see DHKeyChange and
    usmDHKickstartMyPublic\nin the body of the MIB as well as the MIBs revision history).
    \ The\nspelling of 'Hellman' was corrected throughout.  Author contact\ninformation
    was updated.  Slight structural modifications were made\nto more cleanly seperate
    boilerplate from substantive text.\n\t </p>\n      "
