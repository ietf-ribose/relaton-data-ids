abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unlike the existing active and passive OAM techniques, the
    emerging\n   on-path flow telemetry techniques provide unmatched visibility into\n
    \  user traffic, showing great application potential not only for\n   today's
    network OAM but also for future's automatic network\n   operation.  Summarizing
    the current industry practices that addresses\n   the deployment challenges and
    application requirements, we provide a\n   closed-loop framework, named In-situ
    Flow Information Telemetry\n   (iFIT), for efficiently applying a family of underlying
    on-path flow\n   telemetry techniques in various network environments.  The framework\n
    \  enumerates several key architectural components and describes how\n   these
    components are assembled together to achieve a complete and\n   closed-loop working
    solution for on-path flow telemetry.  Following\n   such a framework allows better
    scalability, fosters application\n   innovations, and promotes both vertical and
    horizontal\n   interoperability.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
