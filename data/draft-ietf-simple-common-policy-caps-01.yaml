abstract:
  content: "<p>An important component of presence and location services is policy.Policy
    systems allow the presentity or location target to grantaccess to specific pieces
    of information to specific watchers orrequestors. These policy systems can be
    extremely simple, allowing auser to accept or block requests based solely on the
    identity of therequestor, to extremely complex, allowing for time based rules
    thatgrant or deny specific pieces of information. Policy systems oftensupport
    vendor proprietary features. To allow for interoperabilitybetween clients which
    set such policies, and servers which executethem, it is necessary for clients
    to be able to determine thecapabilities of the server to which it is connected.
    Thisspecification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) basedformat for
    expressing such capabilities.</p>"
