abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) provides
    a\n   provision for the hosts to request for a specific IPv6 address and\n   manage
    the same, whereas the StateLess Address AutoConfiguration\n   (SLAAC) doesn't
    have such a provision.  Also, unavailability of\n   DHCPv6 across all OS platforms
    has limited the IPv6 nodes to not use\n   features like soliciting a prefix of
    desired length and lifetime,\n   renewing, releasing / declining a prefix, etc.
    \ This document\n   proposes IPv6ND extensions for enabling SLAAC devices to solicit\n
    \  prefix information as a hint PIO in RS and other methods like\n   renewing
    or releasing or declining a prefix without introducing any\n   new ICMPv6 message
    or option types.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
