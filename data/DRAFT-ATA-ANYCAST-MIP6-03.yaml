abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited.  In this document
    we\n   explain a new network architecture for global anycasting to solve (1)\n
    \  in practical use and able to realize with existing technology easily,\n   (2)
    about support for stateful communications keeping a session\n   information at
    the end nodes such as TCP. The architecture is based\n   on MIPv6 because there
    are many similarities between MIPv6 and global\n   anycast.\n\t </p>\n      "
