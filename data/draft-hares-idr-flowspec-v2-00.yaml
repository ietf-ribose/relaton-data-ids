abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution
    of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via
    BGP to BGP peers. Three applications utilize this traffic filter policy: (1) mitigation
    of Denial of Service (DoS), (2) enabling of traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNS,
    and (3)centralized traffic control for networks with SDN or NFV controllers. Application
    of centralized traffic utilizing BGP Flow Specification traffic filters may need
    user-ordered filters rather than RFC5575's strict ordering of filters and defined
    ordering of actions. This document proposes a new BGP Flow specification version
    2 that supports user-order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions</p>"
