abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for sessions
    to be\n   redirected by the use of the 3xx response code.  This response code\n
    \  allows redirect servers and proxies to redirect the session or for\n   the
    message to be sent all the way back to the initiating client to\n   recurse.  There
    is no way to direct the domain responsible for the\n   Request-URI to perform
    the redirection.  This document defines a new\n   response code that clients and
    redirect servers could use to ensure\n   that recursion take place within the
    domain responsible for the\n   Request-URI rather than allowing the initiating
    client do perform the\n   redirect.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
