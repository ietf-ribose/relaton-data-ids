abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive
    Cruise\n   Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development\n
    \  Organizations such as ETSI, IEEE P1609, SAE, 3GPP, ISO and FirstNet.\n\n   C-ACC
    and Platooning involve concepts of direct vehicle-to-vehicle,\n   and device-to-device
    communications, which are developed by 3GPP\n   following on work done within
    the METIS EU project.  They are\n   illustrated very clearly in emergency settings
    such as FirstNet.\n\n   IP packets - instead of link-layer frames - are pertinent
    for C-ACC\n   and Platooning use-cases because applications for road safety such
    as\n   WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently involving infrastructure) make use\n
    \  of IP messages, and have proved successful in deployments.\n   Applications
    such as Sentinel operate directly between vehicles, but\n   currently use messages
    not carried over IP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
