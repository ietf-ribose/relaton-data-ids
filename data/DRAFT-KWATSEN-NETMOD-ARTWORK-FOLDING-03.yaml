abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy
    for\n   handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\\')\n   character
    where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any\n   text based artwork,
    producing consistent results regardless the\n   artwork content.  Using a per-artwork
    header, the strategy is both\n   self-documenting and enables automated reconstitution
    of the original\n   artwork.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
