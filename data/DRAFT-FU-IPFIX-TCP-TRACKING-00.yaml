abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes several new TCP connection related Information\n
    \  Elements (IEs) for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol.\n   The
    new Information Elements can be used to export certain\n   characteristics regarding
    a TCP connection.  Through massive\n   gathering of such characteristics, it can
    help build an image of the\n   TCP traffic passing through a network.  The image
    will facilitate the\n   detection of anomaly TCP traffic, especially attacks targeting
    at\n   TCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
