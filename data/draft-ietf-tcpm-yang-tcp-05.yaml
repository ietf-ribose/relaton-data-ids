abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a minimal YANG model for TCP on devices that
    are configured by network management protocols. The YANG model defines a container
    for all TCP connections and groupings of authentication parameters that can be
    imported and used in TCP implementations or by other models that need to configure
    TCP parameters. The model also includes basic TCP statistics. The model is compliant
    with Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).</p>"
