abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth
    for high\n   bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union\n   Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended its\n   Recommendations G.694.1 and
    G.872 to include a new dense wavelength\n   division multiplexing (DWDM) grid
    by defining a set of nominal\n   central frequencies, channel spacings and the
    concept of \"frequency\n   slot\".  In such an environment, a data plane connection
    is switched\n   based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the\n
    \  optical spectrum creating what is known as a flexible grid (flexi-\n   grid).\n\n
    \  Given the specific characteristics of flexi-grid optical networks and\n   their
    associated technology, this document defines a framework and\n   the associated
    control plane requirements for the application of the\n   existing GMPLS architecture
    and control plane protocols to the\n   control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.  The
    actual extensions to the\n   GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.\n\n\t
