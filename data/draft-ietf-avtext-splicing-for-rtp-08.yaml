abstract:
- content: "<p>Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia
    stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the substitutive multimedia
    content to the receivers for a period of time. Splicing is commonly used for local
    advertisement insertion by cable operators, replacing a national advertisement
    content with a local advertisement. This memo describes some use cases for content
    splicing and a set of requirements for splicing content delivered by RTP. It provides
    concrete guidelines for how a RTP mixer can be used to handle content splicing.</p>"
