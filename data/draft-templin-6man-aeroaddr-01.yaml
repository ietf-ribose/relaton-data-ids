abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is unique
    on the link. Nodes normally derive a link local address through the use of IPv6
    Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) along with Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD). This document presents a method for a node to construct a link-local address
    that is assured to be unique on the link when the node has already received a
    delegated prefix. This is through the construction of a link-local address format
    known as the AERO address.</p>"
