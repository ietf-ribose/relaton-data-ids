abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow
    HTTP\n   servers to cryptographically bind authentication tokens (such as\n   cookies
    and OAuth tokens) to TLS [RFC5246] connections.\n\n   We describe both _first-party_
    and _federated_ scenarios.  In a\n   first-party scenario, an HTTP server is able
    to cryptographically\n   bind the security tokens it issues to a client, and which
    the client\n   subsequently returns to the server, to the TLS connection between
    the\n   client and server.  Such bound security tokens are protected from\n   misuse
    since the server can generally detect if they are replayed\n   inappropriately,
    e.g., over other TLS connections.\n\n   Federated token bindings, on the other
    hand, allow servers to\n   cryptographically bind security tokens to a TLS connection
    that the\n   client has with a _different_ server than the one issuing the token.\n\n
    \  This Internet-Draft is a companion document to The Token Binding\n   Protocol
    [I-D.ietf-tokbind-protocol]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
