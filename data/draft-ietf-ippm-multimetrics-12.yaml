abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has standardized IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) for measuring
    end-to-end performance between two points. This memo defines two new categories
    of metrics that extend the coverage to multiple measurement points. It defines
    spatial metrics for measuring the performance of segments of a source to destination
    path, and metrics for measuring the performance between a source and many destinations
    in multiparty communications (e.g., a multicast tree). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
