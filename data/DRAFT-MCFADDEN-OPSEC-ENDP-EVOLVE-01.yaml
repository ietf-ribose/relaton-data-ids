abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses the traditional model of security where\n
    \  endpoints in the network are protected by a variety of tools. It\n   proposes
    a model for endpoints and then argues that the older,\n   traditional approach
    is no longer sufficient for operational\n   security at the endpoint. A series
    of operational examples are\n   discussed in an Appendix.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
