abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload\nformat
    for the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) command\nlanguage.  The format
    encodes all commands that may legally appear on\na MIDI 1.0 DIN cable.  The format
    is suitable for interactive\napplications (such as network musical performance)
    and content-\ndelivery applications (such as file streaming).  The format may
    be\nused over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines tools for\ngraceful
    recovery from packet loss.  Stream behavior, including the\nMIDI rendering method,
    may be customized during session setup.  The\nformat also serves as a mode for
    the mpeg4-generic format, to support\nthe MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General
    MIDI, Downloadable Sounds\nLevel 2, and Structured Audio.\n\t </p>\n      "
