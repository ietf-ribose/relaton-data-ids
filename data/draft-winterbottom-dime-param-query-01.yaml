abstract:
- content: "<p>In an emergency services environment a Location Information Server
    (LIS) receives requests from end hosts, SIP proxies or Public Safety Answering
    Points (PSAPs). When receiving these requests a LIS has to perform a location
    determination procedure that depends on the specific network deployment. In any
    case, an interation with other network elements is needed, particularly with AAA
    servers, that store information about the current attachment of the end host.
    This document descirbes a Diameter application, called Diameter Parameter Query,
    which allows a Location Information Server to interact with a Diameter server
    to obtain information needed for the location determination procedure. The style
    of the described Diameter application offers flexibility for different deployments.</p>"
