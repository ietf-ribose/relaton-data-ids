abstract:
  content: "<p>In an emergency services environment a Location Information Server(LIS)
    receives requests from end hosts, SIP proxies or Public SafetyAnswering Points
    (PSAPs). When receiving these requests a LIS has toperform a location determination
    procedure that depends on thespecific network deployment. In any case, an interation
    with othernetwork elements is needed, particularly with AAA servers, that storeinformation
    about the current attachment of the end host.This document descirbes a Diameter
    application, called DiameterParameter Query, which allows a Location Information
    Server tointeract with a Diameter server to obtain information needed for thelocation
    determination procedure. The style of the describedDiameter application offers
    flexibility for different deployments.</p>"
