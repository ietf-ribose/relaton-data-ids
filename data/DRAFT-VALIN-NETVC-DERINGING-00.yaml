abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a deringing filter that takes into
    account\n   the direction of edges and patterns being filtered.  The filter works\n
    \  by identifying the direction of each block and then adaptively\n   filtering
    along the identified direction.  In a second pass, the\n   blocks are also filtered
    in a different direction, with more\n   conservative thresholds to avoid blurring
    edges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
