abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes a proposed mechanism under which differing
    schemes for the naming, allocation and management of new international top-level
    domains may be tried without their interfering with each other. This memorandum
    discusses the trademrk issues underlying the current debate on International TLDs,
    and proposes non-interfering simultaneous experiments, following the proposals
    of [DENNINGER],[HIGGS],[MASEK] and [POSTEL]. This memo is being distributed to
    the Internet community in order to solicit their opinions of the proposals contained
    in it. In particular, The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM SHARED-TLD and related mailing lists
    are invited to read and comment on this material.</p>"
