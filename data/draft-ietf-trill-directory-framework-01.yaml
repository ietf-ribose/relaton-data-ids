abstract:
- content: "<p>Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and
    their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed through. When an
    ingress RBridge receives a data frame with its destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN)
    unknown, the data frame is flooded within the VLAN across the TRILL campus. When
    there are more than one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of
    them can be designated as the Appointed Forwarder port for forwarding/receiving
    native traffic to/from each VLAN, the other RBridge ports on that LAN have to
    be disabled for native traffic in that VLAN. This draft describes the framework
    for using directory services to assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination
    frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, improving TRILL
    network scalability in environment, such as data centers.</p>"
