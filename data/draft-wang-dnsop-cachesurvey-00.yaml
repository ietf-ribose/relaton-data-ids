abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cache directly serves the DNS queries from stub resolvers as the
    data source in the specified network area. For the present, however, operators
    manage and run the cache service in a diversified manner. This arouses the main
    motivation of this survey report. Instead of regulating or specifying the operation
    of the DNS cache service, our aim is to investigate the situation of the DNS cache
    service (at least in mainland China) and propose the future operation recommendations
    with solid practical foundation.</p>"
