abstract:
  content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in whichboth
    the routers and their interconnects are constrained. LLNrouters typically operate
    with constraints on processing power,memory, and energy (battery power). LLN router
    supported trafficflows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-point.
    The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides themechanisms to support those
    traffic flows. The currently availablesecurity services in RPL will not protect
    against a compromisedinternal node that can also construct and disseminate fake
    messages. In this document, a service is described that prevents an internalattacker
    from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed AcyclicGraph (DODAG) root.
    Moreover, the establishment and maintenance ofany cryptographic key is out of
    the scope of the current RPLproposal. In this document a service that allows nodes
    to agree onlocal keys with their neighborhood is also presented.</p>"
