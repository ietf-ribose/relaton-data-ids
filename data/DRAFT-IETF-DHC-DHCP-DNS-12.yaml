abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DHCP provides a powerful mechanism for IP host configuration.\nHowever,
    the configuration capability provided by DHCP does not\ninclude updating DNS,
    and specifically updating the name to address\nand address to name mappings maintained
    in the DNS.\nThis document specifies how DHCP clients and servers should use the\nDynamic
    DNS Updates mechanism in [RFC2136] to update the DNS name to\naddress and address
    to name mappings so that the mappings for DHCP\nclients will be consistent with
    the IP addresses that the clients\nacquire via DHCP.\n\t </p>\n      "
