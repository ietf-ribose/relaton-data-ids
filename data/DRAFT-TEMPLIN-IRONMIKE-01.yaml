abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new routing
    and\n   addressing architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer\n
    \  packets within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast,\n   multiple
    access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  The IKEv2 Mobility\n   and Multihoming
    Protocol (MOBIKE) allows a Virtual Private Network\n   (VPN) client to keep a
    connection to a VPN gateway active across\n   multiple network points of attachment
    or while moving from one\n   network point of attachment to another.  This document
    examines the\n   similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and observes that they
    are\n   addressing the same fundamental networking objectives.  It further\n   proposes
    ways in which the basic MOBIKE model could be extended\n   through adoption of
    IRON architectural constructs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
