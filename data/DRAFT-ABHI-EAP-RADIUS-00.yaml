abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EAP is used to establish secure communication channel in \nIKEv2
    and in Wireless Security. EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MD5, \nEAP-SIM uses radius protocol
    for communication bewteen \nradius server and the client. These protocols are
    used in \nboth Wireless network authentication and in IKEV2 authentication \nto
    establish VPN tunnel. \n\n\n\n   +----------+        +----------+        +----------+\n

    protocol which can be used \nto establish the secure communication channel between
    the \nradius server and  pass through server. Pass through server \nis access
    point in the case of wireless communication and \nit is gateway in case of IKEV2
    authnetication.\n\t </p>\n      "
