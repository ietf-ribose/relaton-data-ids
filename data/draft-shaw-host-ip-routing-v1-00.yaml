abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies an additional ip routing technique.A host will
    use a route table to determine how to best transmit anetwork datagram packet to
    the destination host. The destinationaddress is compared to a locally maintained
    routing table to determinethe specific gateway. The best route and/or lowest metric
    is used todetermine the gateway to use to reach the destination host. A defaultgateway
    is used if no matches are found in the routing table.</p>"
