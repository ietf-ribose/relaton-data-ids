abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an OPTIONAL feature extending the NFSv4 protocol
    which allows extended attributes (hereinafter also referred to as xattrs) to be
    interrogated and manipulated using NFSv4. An xattr is a file system feature that
    allows opaque metadata, not interpreted by the file system, to be associated with
    files and directories. Such support is present in many modern local file systems.
    New file attributes are proposed to allow clients to query the server for xattr
    support, and new operations to get and set xattrs on file system objects are provided.</p>"
