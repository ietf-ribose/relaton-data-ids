abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the DNS resolver (DNSR) option used to advertise
    \non a link IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers.  The DNSR option, which lists \nthe
    IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that all nodes of the link may use \nto resolve
    name or address, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery \nRouter Advertisement
    messages that are sent across a link. This \ndocument specifies the process used
    by a host to decide how to \nconfigure the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that
    the host could \nuse in IPv6 networks. This document defines the mechanism by
    which a \nnode processes the DNSR option and updates valid IPv6 addresses \nof
    DNS resolvers.\n\t </p>\n      "
