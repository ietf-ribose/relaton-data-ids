abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines Name-based sockets. name-based sockets allow\napplication
    developers to refer to remote hosts (and it self) by name\nonly, passing on all
    IP (locator) management to the operating system.\nApplications are thus relieved
    of re-implementing features such as\nmulti-homing, mobility, NAT traversal, IPv6/IPv4
    interoperability and\naddress management in general.  The operating system can
    in turn re-\nuse the same solutions for a whole set of guest applications. name-\nbased
    sockets aims to provide a whole set of features without adding\nnew indirection
    layers, new delays or other dependences while\nmaintaining transparent backwards
    compatibility.\n\t </p>\n      "
