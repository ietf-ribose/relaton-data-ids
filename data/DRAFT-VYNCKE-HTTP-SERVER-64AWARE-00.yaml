abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Rather than forcing the client to decide whether IPv4 or IPv6
    is more\nconvenient to reach a web server; this document proposes to let the\nweb
    server check whether there is IPv6 connectivity to the client;\nthen the web server
    can do a HTTP redirect to the force the client to\nuse IPv6.\n\nThis is done easily
    by a script within the server HTML pages and does\nnot require any change in the
    client applications or configuration.\nThe client still can control whether he/she
    wants to enabled IPv6.\n\nThis draft could be discussed on the Applications Discuss
    mailing\nlist, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.\n\t </p>\n
