abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document  defines a R2 package in association with the MEGACO
    \nProtocol that can be used to control a Media Gateway (MG) from an \nexternal
    controller, called a Media Gateway controller (MGC).\n\nThe document is organised
    into the following major sections:\n* Introduction to R2 signalling\n* Definition
    of R2 package with brief description of the Events and \nsignals in the package.\n*
    Different call flow scenarios where R2 signalling is used on either \none end
    or both ends. Scenarios with multiple MGCs are also \nconsidered.\n\t </p>\n      "
