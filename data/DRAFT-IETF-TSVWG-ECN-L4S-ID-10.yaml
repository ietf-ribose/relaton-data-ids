abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP
    packets\n   for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n
    \  throughput (L4S).  It is similar to the original (or 'Classic')\n   Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN).  'Classic' ECN marking was\n   required to be equivalent
    to a drop, both when applied in the network\n   and when responded to by a transport.
    \ Unlike 'Classic' ECN marking,\n   for packets carrying the L4S identifier, the
    network applies marking\n   more immediately and more aggressively than drop,
    and the transport\n   response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to
    that for\n   drop.  The two changes counterbalance each other so that the\n   throughput
    of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a non-L4S flow\n   under the same conditions.
    \ Nonetheless, the much more frequent\n   control signals and the finer responses
    to them result in much more\n   fine-grained adjustments, so that ultra-low and
    consistently low\n   queuing delay (typically sub-millisecond on average) becomes
    possible\n   for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.  Thus even\n
    \  capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very\n   low
    delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load.\n\n   The L4S
    identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from\n   'Classic' (e.g.
    \ TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.  It gives an incremental\n   migration path so that
    suitably modified network bottlenecks can\n   distinguish and isolate existing
    traffic that still follows the\n   Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading
    the low queuing delay and\n   loss of L4S traffic.  This specification defines
    the rules that L4S\n   transports and network elements need to follow to ensure
    they neither\n   harm each other's performance nor that of Classic traffic.  Examples\n
    \  of new active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms and examples\n   of
    new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are specified\n   separately.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
