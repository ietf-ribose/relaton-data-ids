abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many (if not all) terminal servers support the ability to set
    up a\n   telnet listener on a serial port.  This allows a connection to a port\n
    \  to be made via the network, however only (two way) data can be\n   transferred
    between the client and the port.\n \n   By using the Remote Serial Port (RSP)
    telnet option, the client is\n   able to control non-data aspects of the port
    such as baud rate and\n   modem signals.  This is especially important where the
    port is\n   attached to a modem and modem signals are required to hangup the\n
    \  modem.\n \n   This document defines a simple protocol which allows terminal
    servers\n   (and other systems which provide access to serial ports via a network\n
    \  connection) to provide access to these features.\n\t </p>\n      "
