abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an LDAP [RFC4511] schema for implementing theKerberos
    5 [RFC4120] KDC Information Model[I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model]. It also defines
    additional elementswhich are not covered by the Information Model, but are already
    incommon use.1. Background and MotivationBoth Kerberos and LDAP are frequently
    used separately for distributedauthentication. They can also be used in combination,
    but typicallytheir user databases remained separate. This distinction indatabases
    causes unnecessary duplication of data and administrationoverhead. As such it
    is desirable for both systems to share a singledatabase. Since the LDAP data model
    is more general it is mostappropriate to store the Kerberos data in LDAP.A number
    of Kerberos implementations already have support for usingLDAP as their KDC backing
    store. However, each implementation usesits own schema, and the multiple schemas
    are mutually incompatible.For the sake of interoperability and administrative
    ease, it isimportant to define a single standard schema that can be useduniformly
    by all Kerberos KDC implementations and interoperates withexisting LDAP specifications.2.
