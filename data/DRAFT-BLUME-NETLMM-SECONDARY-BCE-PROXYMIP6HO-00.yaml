abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized\nmobility
    management, which takes basic operation for registration, \ntunnel management
    and de-registration into account in a first \nprotocol release. This document
    proposes an extension to Proxy \nMobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple
    network interfaces\nimplemented and can be connected over more than one network
    interface\nat the same time.\nThis extension introduces a secondary binding at
    the local Mobility \nAnchor (LMA) that is valid for receiving uplink packets but
    is not \nused for tunneling downlink packets towards the MN. This allows for \npreparation
    of the new binding while avoiding that the LMA will \nprematurely forward data
    packets to the mobile node's new interface \nbefore the address configuration
    of this interface has completed. \nFurthermore, secondary bindings can be used
    to avoid loss of delayed \npackets arriving at the LMA after the Binding Cache
    has been updated\nby a Proxy Binding Update from a new MAG.\nWith the proposed
    extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is not \nnecessary and packet losses
    during an inter-technology handover can \nbe mitigated.\n\t </p>\n      "
