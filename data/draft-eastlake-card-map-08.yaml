    of ISO 7812 financial transaction identification card (i.e.,credit/debit card)
    numbers and ISO 7816 smart card or related numbersmay need to locate on the Internet.
    For example, some systems assumea smart card holder can contact the issuer of
    a smart cardapplication for maintenance and update functions and the paymentprotocols
    may assume that a card holder can locate the appropriatecertification authority
    to obtain a card holder certificate. Thisdocument specifies a method using the
    DNS as an important element inlocating card related facilities on the Internet
    by mapping ISO 7812and ISO 7816 number systems into domain names.</p>"
