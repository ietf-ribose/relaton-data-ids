abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to names using the Domain
    Name\n   System (DNS) is colloquially known as \"Reverse Mapping\".  Reverse\n
    \  Mapping support for registered multicast address assignments in IPv4\n   is
    currently incomplete and ad-hoc; in IPv6 there is no support at\n   all.\n\n   This
    document describes procedures to be followed that will result in\n   more systematic
    and predictable support for Reverse Mapping for IPv4\n   multicast address assignments,
    and introduces analogous support for\n   IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
