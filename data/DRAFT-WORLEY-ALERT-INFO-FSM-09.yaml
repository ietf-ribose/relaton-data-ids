abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"alert\" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can
    be used in\n   the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n
    \  requests and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the\n   characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or\n   terminated.  The user agent
    must resolve the URNs into a signal, that\n   is, it must select the best available
    signal to present to its user\n   to indicate the characteristics of the call.\n\n
    \  RFC 7462 describes a non-normative algorithm for signal selection.\n   This
    document describes a more efficient alternative algorithm: A\n   user agent's
    designer can, based on the user agent's signals and\n   their meanings, construct
    a finite state machine (FSM) to process the\n   URNs to select a signal in a way
    that obeys the restrictions given in\n   the definition of the \"alert\" URN namespace.\n\n\t
