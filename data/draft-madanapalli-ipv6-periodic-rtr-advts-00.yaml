abstract:
- content: "<p>Periodic IPv6 router advertisements are a concern in mobile and cellular
    networks in which the hosts are attached to the network and access router but
    switch state to dormant mode in order to conserve battery power. In addition the
    air interface is a resource that should be used optimally and hence periodic router
    advertisements that an access router would send should be limited. Transmission
    of Periodic router advertisements to hosts on a link by a router should be optional.
    At the very least the interval between such router advertisements should be configurable
    to a value that is significantly higher than currently specified. This document
    provides a recommendation for the periodic router advertisement interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval)
    and router lifetime.</p>"
