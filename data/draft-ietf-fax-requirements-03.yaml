abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition of being a telephony applicationfrom
    one terminal device to another, where the terminal deviceconsists of a paper input
    device (scanner), a paper output device(printer), and a limited amount of processing
    power. The transmissionof data end-to-end is accompanied by negotiation (to ensure
    that thescanned data can be rendered at the recipient) and confirmation ofdelivery
    (to give the sender assurance that the final data has beenreceived and processed.)
    Over time, facsimile has been extended toallow for PCs connected running software
    to send and receive fax, tosend data other than paper images, as well as many
    extensions to thebasic image model, e.g., recent ITU fax standards for color fax.Other
    delivery extensions have included sub-addressing (additionalsignals after the
    call is established to facilitate automated routingof faxes to desktops or mailboxes),
    and enhanced features such asfax-back, polling, and even the transfer of binary
    files. Many mechanisms for sending fax documents over the Internet have beendemonstrated
    and deployed and are currently in use. This document summarizes the requirements
    for Internet Fax asdiscussed in the IETF Internet Fax working group. It is an
    attempt toestablish a baseline of agreed-to requirements against which anyproposal
    for Internet Fax can be judged. This document encompasses therequirements for
    both 'real-time' fax as well as 'store and forward'fax (both terms defined in
    Section 2).</p>"
