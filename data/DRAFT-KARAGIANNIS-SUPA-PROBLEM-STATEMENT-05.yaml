abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The raise in complexity and size of modern networks makes it\n
    \  significantly more challenging to deploy new services and to keep\n   networks
    up to date while maintaining stability and availability for\n   critical business
    services. This is a major challenge that network\n   operators (service providers,
    SME, etc) face today. The operators aim\n   at streamlining operations and the
    deployment of new services by\n   relying increasingly on programmatic control
    of network elements and\n   the use of various virtualization technologies. In
    this context,\n   providing network operators with a set of standard generic YANG-based\n
    \  data models that enable management and automation of services on\n   their
    network is essential. This document describes the set of\n   related problems
    addressed by the SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy\n   Abstractions ) working group.\n\n\n\t
