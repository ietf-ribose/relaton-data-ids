abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the metric of network capacity, including
    link\ncapacity aspect, router capacity aspect and path capacity aspect.\nRFC5136
    has defined link capacity and path capacity, where the router\nimpact is implicitly
    considered in link capacity.  However, in this\ndocument, router capacity is considerred
    as a separate factor of path\ncapacity, no longer a factor of link capacity.  This
    document\nexplicitly describes the router capacity and its impact to network\ncapacity,
    e.g. how to evaluate path capacity.\n\nThis document is derived from RFC5136 and
    obsoletes RFC5136.\n\t </p>\n      "
