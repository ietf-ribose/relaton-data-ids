abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A multi-homed host with multiple physical and/or virtual network
    \n   interfaces has to select which one of the network interfaces to use \n   for
    a new outgoing IPv4 or IPv6 connection. This document describes a \n   method
    to select an interface by using destination's fully qualified \n   domain name
    and DNS suffix information received dynamically for each \n   network interface.
    The method is useful, for example, in split \n   horizon DNS and walled garden
    scenarios, where right network \n   interface has to be selected even before DNS
    resolution is conducted.\n\t </p>\n      "
