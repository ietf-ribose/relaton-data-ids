abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for
    the\n   Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange.\n   This
    document has three goals.  First, increase the security of\n   Kerberos pre-authentication
    exchanges by making offline brute-force\n   attacks infeasible.  Second, enable
    the use of second factor\n   authentication without relying on FAST.  This is
    achieved using the\n   existing trust relationship established by the shared first
    factor.\n   Third, make Kerberos pre-authentication more resilient against time\n
    \  synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted\n   timestamp
    from the client.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
