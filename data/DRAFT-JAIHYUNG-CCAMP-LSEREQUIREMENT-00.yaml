abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this draft, we propose requirement to implement MPLS technology\nfor
    Ethernet switched network. Ethernet has become major building\nblock in local
    area network and the area of deployment is quickly\nexpanding to core network.
    While there have been industry needs to\novercome weakness of Ethernet, MPLS has
    not been considered as key\ntechnology to improve Ethernet. Currently MPLS [RFC3031]
    and GMPLS\n[GARCH] architecture do not define label-switching function on\nL2SC
    interface, i.e. over LAN media. Hence, it is necessary to\ndiscuss lightweight
    implementation of MPLS for Ethernet. Since\nthere is disparity in requirements
    depending on hierarchy of Ethernet,\nit is appropriate to separate discussion
    in Customer Premise Network\n(CPN), Access Network (AN) and Core Network (CN).
    Some candidate \nmethods to consider for label encoding for Ethernet are discussed.\n\t
