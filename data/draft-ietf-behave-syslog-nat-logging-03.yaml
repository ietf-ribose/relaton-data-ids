abstract:
- content: "<p>With the wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the logging
    of NAT-related events has become very important for various operational purposes.
    The logs may be required for troubleshooting, to identify a host that was used
    to launch malicious attacks, and/or for accounting purposes. This document identifies
    the events that need to be logged and the parameters that are required in the
    logs depending on the context in which the NAT is being used. It goes on to standardize
    formats for reporting these events and parameters using SYSLOG (RFC 5424). A companion
    document specifies formats for reporting the same events and parameters using
    IPFIX (RFC 5101). Applicability statements are provided in this document and its
    companion to guide operators and implementors in their choice of which technology
    to use for logging.</p>"
