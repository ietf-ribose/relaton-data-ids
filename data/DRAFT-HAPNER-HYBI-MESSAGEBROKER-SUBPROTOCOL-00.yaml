abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The WebSocket protocol [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol]
    provides\n   a subprotocol extension facility.  The MessageBroker WebSocket\n
    \  Subprotocol (MBWS) is a WebSocket Subprotocol used by messaging\n   clients
    to send messages to, and receive messages from an internet\n   message broker
    (herein called a message broker).  A message broker is\n   a messaging intermediary
    that queues messages sent by its clients for\n   asynchronous delivery to its
    clients.\n\n   Messages are addressed to message-broker-specific address names.\n
    \  Clients send messages to addresses and consume messages from\n   addresses.
    \ Clients do not send messages directly to other clients.\n\n   Message brokers
    provide a range of functionality that is outside the\n   scope of MBWS.  Typically
    an internet message broker provides a REST\n   API for working with this functionality;
    such as configuring client\n   credentials; setting client access controls; configuring
    address\n   routing; etc.\n\n   MBWS limits its scope to the definition of a WebSocket
    subprotocol\n   that provides a full duplex, reliable message transport protocol\n
    \  between message brokers and their clients; and, between message\n   brokers.\n\n
    \  Since reliable message transport is often independent of a broker's\n   particular
    features, MBWS can be used as the message transport\n   protocol for a wide range
    of message brokers.  MBWS utilizes two\n   elements of WebSocket extensibility
    - opcodes and extension data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
