abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force
    attacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed adversary.  As
    a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications continue to rely on DES for security, and
    designers and implementers continue to support it in new applications.  While
    this is not always inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security
    implications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all the information
    they need to make judicious decisions regarding its use.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t </p>\n      "
