abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices
    include\n   more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries\n   between
    telecommunication and other applications becomes less clear.\n   Simultaneously,
    as the end-devices become more mobile, application\n   traffic transits more often
    between enterprise networks, the\n   Internet, and cellular telecommunication
    networks.  In this context,\n   it is crucial that quality of service be aligned
    between these\n   different environments.  However, this is not always the case
    by\n   default, and cellular communication networks use a different QoS\n   nomenclature
    from the Internet and enterprise networks.  This\n   document specifies a set
    of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n   Quality of Service (QoS) Class
    Identifiers (QCI) to Differentiated\n   Services Code Point (DSCP) mappings, to
    reconcile the marking\n   recommendations offered by the 3GPP with the recommendations
    offered\n   by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent QoS treatment between\n
    \  cellular networks and the Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
