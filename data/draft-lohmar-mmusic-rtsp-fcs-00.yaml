abstract:
  content: "<p>RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streamingmedia
    sessions, which are delivered via an external media transportprotocol such as
    RTP/UDP. RTSP does not define a mechanism to changethe content during an on-going
    streaming session. Such a mechanismimproves the streaming experience when a user
    browses throughmultiple offerings on a single streaming site.This document describes
    several methods to improve content switching.The basic principle is to re-use
    already established transportsessions (e.g. RTP/UDP sessions) and negotiate new
    content to bedelivered on the existing sessions. If additional transport sessionsare
    necessary, those sessions are established separately. Thisprinciple of re-using
    the RTSP control and transport sessionsdecreases the content switch delay to a
    large extent and improves theend-user experience.The present document defines
    a mechanism for switching to newcontent, both when the client already has the
    content descriptionavailable and when it does not.This document additionally considers
    switching of a single mediastream in a session, when several alternative media
    components areavailable. For instance, the content may provide several alternateaudio
    tracks in different languages to be played with a single videostream.The principle
    of Fast Content Switching and Start-up is also definedin 3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234]
    for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].</p>"
