abstract:
  content: "<p>This document introduces an extension to Mobile IPv6 to providesupport
    for Localized Mobility Management. This proposed Hop-by-HopLocal Mobility Agents
    Probing scheme specifies the Local MobilityAgents Discovery, Selection and Failure
    Detection architecture andprocedures for deploying the localized mobility management,
    wherebythe Local Mobility Agents are distributed. It reduces the amount ofsignalling
    to the home agent and correspondent nodes when mobile nodemoves among the subnets
    of the visited domain</p>"
