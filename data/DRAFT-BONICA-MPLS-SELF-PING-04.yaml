abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LSP Self-ping is a new, light-weight protocol that ingress
    LSRs can\n   use to verify an LSPs readiness to carry traffic.  LSP Self-ping
    does\n   not consume control plane resources on the egress LSR.\n\n   When an
    ingress LSR executes LSP Self-ping procedures, it constructs\n   a probe message.
    \ The probe message is an IP datagram whose\n   destination address represents
    an interface on the ingress LSR.\n\n   The ingress LSR forwards the probe through
    the LSP under test.  If\n   the LSP is ready to forward traffic, the egress LSR
    receives the\n   probe.  Because the probe is addressed to the ingress LSR, the
    egress\n   LSR forwards the probe back to the ingress.  When the ingress LSR\n
    \  receives the probe, it has verified LSP readiness without consuming\n   control
    plane resources at the egress LSR.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
