abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of the assignment is to emphasise on the necessity
    of \navailable transport protocol for public broadcast of audio-video data in
    a packet switching network, in particular in Internet. A theoretic \nscheme of
    such protocol is suggested, conventionally called RTVP - Radio and Television
    Protocol. The spreading of information, that the teoretic protocol is trying to
    achieve, is general, i.e. independence in loading the supplying radio and television
    program server from the number of viewers has been sought. The purpose also is
    to achieve receiving quality which is independant from the number of viewers.
    The theoretical RTVP achieves these goals by implementing the radio transmitting
    idea in a packet switching network.\n\t </p>\n      "
