abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an end-to-end mechanism to guarantee
    bandwidth\n   and delay into the Differentiated Services mechanism to constant
    rate\n   traffic  such  as  voice and video. The  mechanism  requires  network\n
    \  routers  to  be able to serve packets according to three  classes  of\n   priority.
    \ The needed call admission control is performed by an  end-\n   to-end  signaling
    \ procedure that implicitly looks for  the  required\n   bandwidth and seizes
    it, if available. Short delays are guaranteed by\n   the  regular  structure of
    constant rate traffic. No  entities  other\n   than  source  and destination are
    involved  and  multicast  operation\n   comes  at no further cost, which makes
    the mechanism  fully  scalable\n   and integrable into the existing Internet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
