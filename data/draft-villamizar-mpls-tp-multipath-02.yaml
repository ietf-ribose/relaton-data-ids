abstract:
- content: "<p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many
    MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth
    applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS-TP has discouraged
    the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot
    be avoided when operating over current high bandwidth multipath implementations.
    The tradeoffs involved in using multipath techniques with MPLS and MPLS-TP are
    described. Requirements are discussed which enable full MPLS-TP compliant LSP
    including full OAM capability to be carried over MPLS LSP which are traversing
    multipath links. Other means of supporting MPLS-TP coexisting with MPLS and multipath
    are discussed.</p>"
