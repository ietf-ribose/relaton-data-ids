abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text describes evolving networking technology within\n
    \  increasingly large residential home networks.  The goal of this\n   document
    is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home\n   networking, describing
    the associated principles, considerations and\n   requirements.  The text briefly
    highlights specific implications of\n   the introduction of IPv6 for home networking,
    discusses the elements\n   of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6
    mechanisms and\n   addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture\n
    \  describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain\n   additional
    functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network\n   is not actively managed,
    and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack\n   network.  There are no recommendations
    in this text for the IPv4 part\n   of the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
