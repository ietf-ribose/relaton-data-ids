abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level
    (such\n   as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and\n
    \  gateway control level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this\n   RFC is
    related to gateway control specific SDP usage. Gateway\n   control protocols do
    NOT usually define and introduce any new SDP\n   parameters, however, gateway
    control protocols need specific SDP\n   parameter values in addition to those
    defined usaged at call or\n   bearer control level. Such SDP codepoints are collected
    by this RFC\n   with the purpose of registration with IANA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
