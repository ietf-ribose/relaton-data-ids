abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NEMO Basic support protocol [1] specifies the operation
    of a\n   Mobile Router.  The Mobile Router has a bi-directional tunnel to\n   its
    Home Agent through which it reverse tunnels all traffic.  When\n   the Mobile
    Router roams and connects to an access network that only\n   implements IPv4,
    it needs to use IPv6 transition tunneling mechanisms\n   to reach its Home Agent.
    \ This will result in a NEMO tunnel inside a\n   transition tunnel.  This document
    describes protocol extensions to\n   the NEMO Basic support protocol to maintain
    IPv6 connectivity for the\n   Mobile Router via its Home Agent with IPv6-over-IPv4
    encapsulation\n   with no special boxes to be deployed anywhere in the network.\n\t
