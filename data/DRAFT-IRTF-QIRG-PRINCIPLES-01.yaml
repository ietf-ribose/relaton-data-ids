abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance
    Internet\n   technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points\n
    \  on Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be\n   built
    from the ground up as the physical nature of the communication\n   is fundamentally
    different.  The first realisations of quantum\n   networks are imminent, but there
    is no practical proposal for how to\n   organise, utilise, and manage such networks.
    \ In this memo, we\n   attempt lay down the framework and introduce some basic
    architectural\n   principles for a quantum internet.  This is intended for general\n
    \  guidance and general interest, but also to provide a foundation for\n   discussion
    between physicists and network specialists.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
