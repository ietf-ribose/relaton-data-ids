abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document  identifies the basic information to be handled
    by\nService Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when\nconsidering
    the deployment of value-added IP service offerings over\nthe Internet. Such IP
    service offerings can be provided together with\na given quality of service (QoS),
    which is expected to be defined in\nsuch SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since
    these IP services are\nlikely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding\nQoS
    will be based upon a set of technical parameters that both\ncustomers and services
    providers will have to agree upon. From this\nperspective, this draft aims at
    listing (and promoting a standard\nformalism for) a set of basic parameters which
    will actually compose\nthe elementary contents of a SLS.\n\t </p>\n      "
