abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes remote checksum offload for VXLAN. Remote
    checksum offload is a mechanism that provides checksum offload of transport checksums
    in encapsulated packets using rudimentary offload capabilities found in most Network
    Interface Card (NIC) devices. The outer UDP checksum is enabled on transmit and,
    with some additional meta data, a receiver is able to deduce the checksum to be
    set in an encapsulated packet. Effectively this offloads the computation of the
    inner checksum which can be a significant performance optimization. Enabling the
    UDP checksum has the additional advantage that it covers more of the packet including
    the IP pseudo header and virtual network identifier.</p>"
