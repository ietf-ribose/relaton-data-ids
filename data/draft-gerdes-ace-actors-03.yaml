abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    Due to the limitations of the constrained nodes it is especially important to
    develop a light-weight security solution which is adjusted to the relevant security
    objectives of each participating party in this environment. Necessary security
    measures must be identified and applied where needed. In this document, the required
    security related tasks are identified as guidance for the development of authentication
    and authorization solutions for constrained environments. Based on the tasks,
    an architecture is developed to represent the relationships between the logical
    functional entities involved.</p>"
