abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the
    concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might
    be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols. Data channel setup
    can be done using either the in-band WebRTC Data Channel protocol or some external
    (in-band or out-of-band) negotiation. This document specifies how the SDP offer/answer
    exchange can be used to achieve such an external negotiation.</p>"
