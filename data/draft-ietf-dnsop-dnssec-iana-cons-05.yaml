abstract:
- content: "<p>This document changes the review requirements needed to get DNSSEC
    algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries. It updates RFC 6014
    to include hash algorithms for Delegation Signer (DS) records and NextSECure version
    3 (NSEC3) parameters (for Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence). It also updates
    RFCs 5155 and 6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms, and updates
    RFC 8624 to clarify the implementation recommendation related to the algorithms
    described in RFCs that are not on the standards track. The rationale for these
    changes is to bring the requirements for DS records and hash algorithms used in
    NSEC3 in line with the requirements for all other DNSSEC algorithms.</p>"
