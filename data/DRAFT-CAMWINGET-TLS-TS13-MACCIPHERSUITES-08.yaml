abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT)
    and\n   constrained environments that do not require confidentiality, though\n
    \  message integrity for all communications and mutual authentication\n   during
    tunnel establishment are both still mandated.  Examples of\n   such use cases
    are given, although a threat model is necessary to\n   determine whether or not
    a given situation falls into this catergory\n   of use cases.  In order to serve
    these use cases, this document\n   defines the use of HMAC only cipher suites
    for TLS 1.3, which\n   provides mutual authentication and data authenticity, but
    not data\n   confidentiality.  The approach described in this document is not\n
    \  endorsed by the IETF and does not have IETF consensus, but is\n   presented
    here to enable interoperable implementation of a reduced\n   security mechanism
    that provides authentication and message integrity\n   without supporting confidentiality.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
