abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The service function chaining concept differentiates between
    a\n   service function chain and a service function path.   A chain is a\n   sequence
    of service function types whereas a path is a sequence of\n   service function
    instances that realize each type of service\n   function.\n\n   This document
    describes the architectural approach to reducing the\n   abstract service function
    chain to the concrete service function\n   path.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
