abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is an informational document intended to outline what
    is known\n   about routing stability of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), traffic\n
    \  engineering techniques (TE) used in MPLS, and load balancing\n   techniques.
    \ Known stable and unstable conditions provide bounds of\n   known behavior.  Network
    operators and equipment suppliers have\n   relied heavily on operational experience
    as existence proof of\n   instability or evidence of apparent stability.  Between
    the bounds of\n   known stable and unstable behavior there may be conditionally
    stable\n   protocols and deployment scenarios.  There is some discussion of the\n
    \  difficulty of mathematical stability proof for some techniques and a\n   challenge
    to the research community.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
