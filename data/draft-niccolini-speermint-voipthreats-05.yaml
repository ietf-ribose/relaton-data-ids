abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo presents the different security threats related toSPEERMINT
    classifying them into threats to the Location Function, tothe Signaling Function
    and to the Media Function. The differentinstances of the threats are briefly introduced
    inside theclassification. Finally the existing security solutions in SIP andRTP/RTCP
    are presented to describe the countermeasures currentlyavailable for such threats.
    The objective of this document is toidentify and enumerate the SPEERMINT-specific
    threat vectors in orderto specify security-related requirements. Once the requirements
    areidentified, methods and solutions how to achieve such requirementscan be selected.</p>"
