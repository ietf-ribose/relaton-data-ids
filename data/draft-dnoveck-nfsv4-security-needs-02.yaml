abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the inadequate approach to security within
    the family of NFSv4 protocol specifications and proposes steps to correct the
    situation. Because the security architecture is similar for all NFSv4 minor versions,
    we recommend a single new standards- track document to encapsulate NFSv4 security
    fundamentals, and propose the introduction of several additional security-related
    documents.</p>"
