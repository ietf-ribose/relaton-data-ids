abstract:
  content: "<p>When operators start to customize user terminals, host-based IPv6 translation
    will be feasible. Host-based translation should overcome single-point failure
    problems and support various connections between two IP families networks simultaneously.
    In addition, legacy IPv4 applications should not be modified. This document will
    discuss host-based translation applicable scenarios and corresponding issues.</p>"
