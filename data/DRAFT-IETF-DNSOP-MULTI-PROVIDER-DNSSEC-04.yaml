abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many enterprises today employ the service of multiple DNS providers\n
    \  to distribute their authoritative DNS service.  Deploying DNSSEC in\n   such
    an environment may present some challenges depending on the\n   configuration
    and feature set in use.  In particular, when each DNS\n   provider independently
    signs zone data with their own keys,\n   additional key management mechanisms
    are necessitated.  This document\n   presents deployment models that accommodate
    this scenario and\n   describe these key management requirements.  These models
    do not\n   require any changes to the behavior of validating resolvers, nor do\n
    \  they impose the new key management requirements on authoritative\n   servers
    not involved in multi signer configurations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
