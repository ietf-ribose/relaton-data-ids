abstract:
- content: "<p>The problem of today's VoIP user agents (hardware terminals, SIP soft
    phones) is the need for quite a bit of manual configuration at the initialization
    time as well as when moving from one environment to another. The information to
    be configured is typically not known by the end-user. Automatic configuration
    of SIP user agents would release the user of these configuration tasks. This memo
    describes the challenges of auto-configuration of SIP user agents and gives some
    requirements for further discussions.</p>"
