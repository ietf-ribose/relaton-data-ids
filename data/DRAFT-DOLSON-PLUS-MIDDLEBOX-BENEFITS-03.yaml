abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate
    (PLUS)\n   protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits\n
    \  that might be provided by permitting middleboxes to have some\n   visibility
    to transport-layer information.\n\n   This document summarizes benefits provided
    to the Internet by\n   intermediary devices that provide functions apart from
    normal IP\n   forwarding.  Such intermediary devices are often called\n   \"middleboxes\".\n\n
    \  RFC3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the Internet.\n   Most
    of those middleboxes utilize or modify application-layer data.\n   This document
    primarily focuses on devices that observe and act on\n   information carried in
    the transport layer, and especially\n   information carried in TCP packets.\n\n
    \  A primary goal of this document is to provide information to working\n   groups
    developing new transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and\n   QUIC working
    groups, to aid understanding of what might be gained or\n   lost by design decisions
    that may affect (or be affected by)\n   middlebox operation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
