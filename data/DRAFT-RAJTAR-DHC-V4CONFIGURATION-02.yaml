abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers
    are\n   taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-\n   stack
    functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services\n   is still an
    ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6\n   softwire tunnels are
    being developed to meet this need.\n\n   In order to provision end-user's hosts
    with the necessary IPv4\n   configuration, a number of different mechanisms have
    been proposed.\n   This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with
    the aim\n   of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
