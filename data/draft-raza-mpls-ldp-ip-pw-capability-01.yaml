abstract:
- content: <p>Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like
    IP label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling. When an LDP session comes up, an LDP
    speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for such LDP applications
    even when the peer session may be established for some other applications like
    ICCP. This document proposes a solution by which an LDP speaker announces its
    "incapability" or disability or non-support for IP label switching or L2VPN/PW
    application, hence disabling corresponding application state exchange over the
    established LDP session.</p>
