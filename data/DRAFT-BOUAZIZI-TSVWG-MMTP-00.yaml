abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPEG Media Transport Protocol (MMTP) is a transport protocol
    that\n   is designed to support download, progressive download, and streaming\n
    \  applications simultaneously.  MMTP provides a generic media streaming\n   mode
    by optimizing the delivery of generic media data encapsulated\n   according to
    the ISO-Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF).  In the file\n   delivery mode, MMTP
    supports the delivery of any type of file.  MMTP\n   may used in IP unicast or
    multicast delivery and supports both\n   Forward Error Correction (FEC) and retransmissions
    for reliable\n   delivery of content.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
