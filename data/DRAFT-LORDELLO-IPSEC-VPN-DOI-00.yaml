abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPSec DOI for ISAKMP defines identities for phase 2 exchanges\nthat
    are suitable for a flat, unique address space. On the other\nhand, different VPN's
    cannot guarantee a non-overlapping address\nspace among them. Therefore when security
    gateways on an ISP network\nnegotiate IPSec SA's in the context of multiple VPN's,
    identifying\ntraffic flows for this multiplicity of VPN's become an issue. Of\ncourse,
    an alternative would be to have multiple contexts of\nsecurity gateways, one for
    each VPN. Unfortunately that would impose\nsevere administrative challenges to
    an ISP, some of which are\ndescribed later. Another alternative and a more appealing
    one would\nbe to have a single security gateway with a single tunnel endpoint\naddress,
    a single X.509 certificate, etc., that exists in a common\ncontext and is able
    to negotiate IPSec tunnels for any VPN with a\npresence in the security gateway.
    For the later to be possible\nhowever, it is required for this common security
    gateway to be able\nto negotiate phase 2 SA's on behalf of each one of these VPN's
    with\noverlapping address spaces. A second motivation for the later\napproach
    would be to simply negotiate IPSec tunnels for each VPN as\na whole without implying
    any specific traffic flow. This\nspecification describes an extended DOI for ISAKMP
    which, while\ninheriting the existing IPSec DOI in its entirety, defines extra\ntypes
    of phase 2 identities which include a VPN-ID field as an extra\npiece of tunnel
    identity, i.e., a qualifier for the IP addresses\nselectors. The VPN-ID is defined
    in RFC 2685.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
