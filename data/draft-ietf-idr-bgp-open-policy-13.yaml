abstract:
- content: "<p>Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate assumptions
    of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route learned from one lateral peer
    to another lateral peer or a transit provider, passing a route learned from one
    transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral peer. Existing approaches
    to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no check
    that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP neighbor, or enforcement
    that the two eBGP speakers agree on the relationship. This document enhances BGP
    OPEN to establish agreement of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route
    Server client) relationship of two neighboring eBGP speakers to enforce appropriate
    configuration on both sides. Propagated routes are then marked with an Only to
    Customer (OTC) attribute according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention
    and detection of route leaks.</p>"
