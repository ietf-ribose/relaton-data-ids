abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While conventional wisdom has it that Wireless Access Points arestrictly
    Layer 2 bridges, such devices today perform some higherlayer functions of routers
    or switches in wired Infrastructure inaddition to bridging the wired and wireless
    networks. For example,in 802.11 networks, Access Points can function as Network
    AccessServers. For this reason, Access Points have IP addresses and canfunction
    as IP devices.</p>"
