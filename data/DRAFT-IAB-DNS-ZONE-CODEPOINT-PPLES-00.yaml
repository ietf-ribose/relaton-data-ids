abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IDNA makes available to DNS zone administrators a very wide
    range of\n   Unicode code points.  Most operators of zones should probably not\n
    \  permit registration of U-labels using the entire range.  This is\n   especially
    true of zones that accept registrations from outside\n   parties, including (and
    most importantly) the root.  It is\n   unfortunately not possible to generate
    algorithms to determine\n   whether a code point is intrinsically safe to permit.
    \ This memo\n   presents a set of principles that can be used to guide the decision\n
    \  of whether a Unicode code point may be wisely included in the\n   repertoire
    of permissible code points in a U-label in a zone.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
