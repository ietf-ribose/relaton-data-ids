abstract:
  content: "<p>DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals important
    information about the person who caused the queries, and it would be better if
    eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic. This document describes how to use
    TLS for encrypting DNS traffic between a system acting as a DNS stub resolver
    and a system acting as a DNS recursive resolver. It defines how to transport DNS
    queries and responses under TLS on port 443 using ALPN. Discussion of this draft
    should take place in the DPRIVE WG.</p>"
