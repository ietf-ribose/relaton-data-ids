abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents the test specification for M3UA (MTP3 User
    \nAdaptation) protocol (ver 05), which can be used to test M3UA \nimplementations
    for conformance to the protocol definition. The list \nof test is exhaustive and
    covers almost all the categories of test.\nThis draft can also be used in conjunction
    with M3UA specification by\nimplementers of protocol as implementers guide, as
    the pictorial \nrepresentation of various scenarios help easy understanding of
    the \nprotocol.\n\nNext revision of the draft will cover the additions done to
    the\nprotocol revision and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
