  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft intends to trigger discussions within the SIP community
    on\n   how to implement session-specific policies in SIP. In particular, we\n
    \  discuss why the piggyback model, which was proposed previously, does\n   not
    meet important requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
