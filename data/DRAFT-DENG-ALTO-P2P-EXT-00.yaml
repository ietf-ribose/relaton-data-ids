abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The initial purpose for ALTO protocol is to provide better
    than\n   random peer selection for p2p networks.  The peer selection method\n
    \  does not only depend on the peer location, but also on other\n   properties
    of a peering node.  In this document, we define the\n   possible ALTO endpoint
    property extensions that will impact peer\n   selection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
