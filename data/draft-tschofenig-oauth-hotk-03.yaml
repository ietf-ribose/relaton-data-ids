abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing
    access to protected resources. Bearer tokens require Transport Layer Security
    to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server when presenting the
    access token. The security model is based on proof-of-possession: access token
    storage and transfer has to be done with care to prevent leakage. There are, however,
    use cases that require a more active involvement of the OAuth client for an increased
    level of security, particularly to secure against token leakage. This document
    specifies an OAuth security framework using the holder-of-the-key concept, which
    requires the OAuth client when presenting an OAuth access token to also demonstrate
    knowledge of keying material that is bound to the token.</p>"
