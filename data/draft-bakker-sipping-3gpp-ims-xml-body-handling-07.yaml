abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers new disposition-types for the Content- Disposition
    header field that apply to the application/3gpp-ims+xml body used by 3GPP. The
    applicability of these content-disposition values are limited to 3GPP IMS. The
    application/3gpp-ims+xml body has the following three distinct uses: (1) for redirecting
    the emergency session to use a different domain (e.g. using a Circuit Switched
    call), (2) for delivering user profile specific information from the SIP registrar
    to an Application Server, and (3) for causing a UAC to attempt to re-register
    with the IMS.</p>"
