abstract:
  content: "<p>Outside of the IETF community, lot of people think that IPv4 to IPv6transition
    consist merely at solving the problem of how does a v4 boxcommunicate with a v6
    box and vice versa. Within the IETF, the dualstack approach has long been defined.
    There is an ongoing discussionto understand if translation with tools like [NAT-PT]
    is absolutlyneeded to enable IPv6 nodes to communicate with an IPv4 node or if
    wecan/should mandate IPv6 nodes to also deploy an IPv4 stack if/whenthey needs
    to communicate with IPv4 nodes. This draft is aimed atclarifying the discussion
    without taking side by studying in 3 casesthe implications of mandating a dual-stack
    versus the implications ofdeploying a translation device.</p>"
