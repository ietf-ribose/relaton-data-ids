abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TWAMP protocol provides a common architecture for two way\n
    \  measurements in the IP network.  However IP network performance are\n   also
    affected by a set of L4-L7 service deployed in the network.\n   Monitoring of
    these service performance in the IP network also plays\n   a vital role in network
    optimization and application layer traffic\n   optimization.  This capability
    is not supported by the existing TWAMP\n   protocol.\n\n   In this document, we
    extend TWAMP protocol to support service\n   performance monitoring and service
    KPIs calculation.  Some of the\n   existing fields in the TWAMP protocol are extended
    to support new\n   modes for calculating these KPIs.  A set of new messages are
    added in\n   the control protocol between TWAMP client (session sender) and the\n
    \  TWAMP server (session reflector).  Services here ranging from Layer 4\n   to
    Layer 7 services,such as Http based services, Traffic load\n   balancer, DPI,
    Video caching, real time streaming and IPSec.  The\n   KPIs MAY be service latency,
    liveliness of an application, number of\n   flows and sessions per service, load
    balancer statistics.\n\n   There is a separate Draft[I.D-spv-ippm-monitor-implementation-\n
    \  services-kpi] that talks about implementation of monitoring these\n   KPIs
    in the network using TWAMP.  Monitoring of these KPIs in the\n   service plane
    with in a network play a vital role in optimum usage of\n   network resources
    and improving the overall performance and capacity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
