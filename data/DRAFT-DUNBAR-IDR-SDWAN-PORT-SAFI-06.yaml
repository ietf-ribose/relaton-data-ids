abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document describes how the SDWAN SAFI, which is assigned
    by IANA\n   in the First Come First Server range, is used for SDWAN edge nodes\n
    \  to propagate its WAN port properties to its controller.\n\n   In the context
    of this document, BGP Route Reflectors (RR) is the\n   component of the SDWAN
    Controller that receives the BGP UPDATE from\n   SDWAN edges and in turns propagate
    the information to a group of\n   authorized SDWAN edges reachable via overlay
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
