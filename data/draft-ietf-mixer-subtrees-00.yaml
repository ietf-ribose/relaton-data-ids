abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines techniques for representing two types of information
    mapping in the OSI Directory: Mapping from a key to a value (or set of values),
    as might be done in a table lookup, and mapping from a distinguished name to an
    associated value (or values), where the values are not defined by the owner of
    the entry. This is achieved by use of a directory subtree. [STANDARDS-TRCK]</p>"
