abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond or to respond
    correctly to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term
    problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of common
    classes of queries to which some servers either fail to respond or else respond
    incorrectly. This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other similar
    zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem. The document does
    not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure of the responses.</p>"
