abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems
    within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway Protocol [BGP],
    which is used to provide routing information between autonomous systems. This
    document proposes a system where the origin of any advertisement within BGP can
    be verified and authenticated, preventing the advertisement of prefix blocks by
    unauthorized networks, verifying that the final destination in the path is actually
    within the autonomous system to which the packets are being routed, and proving
    the validity of the AS Path contained in the update.</p>"
