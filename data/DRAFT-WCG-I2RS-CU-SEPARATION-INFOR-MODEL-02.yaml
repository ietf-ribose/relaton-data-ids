abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To improve network resource utilization and reduce the operation\n
    \  expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation conception is\n   raised
    [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].  This document\n   describes the information
    model for the interface between Control-\n   Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.
    \ This information model may\n   involve both control channel interface and configuration
    channel\n   interface.  The interface for control channel allows the Control-\n
    \  Plane to send several flow tables to the User-Plane, such as user's\n   information
    table, user's interface table, and user's QoS table, etc.\n   And it also allows
    the User-Plane to report the resources and\n   statistics information to the Control-Plane.
    \ The interface for\n   configuration channel is in charge of the version negotiation
    of\n   protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane, the configuration\n
    \  for devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane, and the reports of User-\n   Plane's
    capabilities, etc.  The information model defined in this\n   document enables
    defining a standardized data model.  Such a data\n   model can be used to define
    an interface to the CU separation BNG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
