abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internationalization of protocols and programs often requires\n
    \  determining where to use one or another character repertoire,\n   codeset,
    encoding, where to perform localization, and so on.  This\n   document aims to
    serve as a guide to Internet protocol designers in\n   determining what they may
    or should recommend or require of protocol\n   implementors.  Of particular interest
    in this document are filesystem\n   protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
