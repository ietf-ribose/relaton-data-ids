abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document identifies the situations where a signature\n
    \    verification fails in a recursive security aware DNS server, and\n     how
    DNS servers should handle these cases, and the errors that\n     should be reported
    to DNS resolvers.  This document proposes a new\n     error to be returned by
    DNSSEC capable servers.\n \n     A DNSSEC server acting as a recursive server
    MUST validate the\n     signatures on RRsets in a response it passes on; this
    draft\n     addresses the case when the data it receives fails signature\n     verification.
    \ The end resolver must be notified of this occurence\n     in such a way that
    it will not confuse it with another error.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
