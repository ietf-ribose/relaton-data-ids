abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dynamic bandwidth management using ATM Resource Adjuster Cells
    provides\nthe capability to support fast effective end-to-end bandwidth control\nfor
    IP traffic transported over an ATM backbone network. This feature\ncan open up
    potential new services for Service Providers to offer\ndynamic service levels
    traffic agreements to their customers. By\noffering dynamic service levels, Service
    Providers can broaden their\nscope of service differentiation. For example, using
    dynamic bandwidth\nfeature, Service Providers can offer their customers real-time
    video or multimedia transport capability across the networks. \n\nUsing Dynamic
    Resource Adjuster Cells (DRACs), the network supporting it\ncan quickly adjust
    bandwidth without taking down the ATM network\nconnection and re-establishing
    it. In a fast changing dynamic\nenvironment, this dynamic adjuster capability
    makes a difference in\nboth performance and scalability.\n\t </p>\n      "
