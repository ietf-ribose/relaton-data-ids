abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a way to perform mobility in IPv4 \n
    \  (potentially IPv6) without requiring any new entity in networks \n   infrastructure
    (e.g. Home Agent, Foreign Agent, etc.). Instead of \n   using infrastructure entities
    this method delegates all the mobility \n   function to the end nodes. The method
    relies on source and \n   destination address translation at the end nodes, and
    signaling \n   between end nodes to perform hand offs - all these function can
    be \n   encapsulated in an entity called Mobility Agent (MA) in the end \n   nodes.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
