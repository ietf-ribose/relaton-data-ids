abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote
    secure\n   key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to also operate in domains\n
    \  featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between involved\n   components.
    \ To support such use cases, BRSKI-AE relies on the\n   exchange of authenticated
    self-contained objects (signature-wrapped\n   objects) also for requesting and
    distributing of domain specific\n   device certificates.  The defined approach
    is agnostic regarding the\n   utilized enrollment protocol allowing the application
    of existing and\n   potentially new certificate management protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n
