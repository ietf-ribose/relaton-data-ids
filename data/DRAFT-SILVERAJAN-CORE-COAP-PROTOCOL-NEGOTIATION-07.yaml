abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging\n   CoAP
    resource representations, this document introduces a way forward\n   for CoAP
    endpoints as well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate\n   transport and
    protocol configurations as well as URIs for CoAP\n   messaging.  Several mechanisms
    are proposed: Extending the CoRE\n   Resource Directory with new parameter types,
    introducing a new CoAP\n   Option with which clients can interact directly with
    servers without\n   needing the Resource Directory, and finally a new CoRE Link
    Attribute\n   allowing exposing alternate locations on a per-resource basis.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
