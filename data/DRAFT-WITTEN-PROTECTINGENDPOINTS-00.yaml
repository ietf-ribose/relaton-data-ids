abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the logic for third-party and network\n
    \  security to complement strong cryptographic protocols, and presents\n   data,
    including independently verifiable data, helping scale the\n   importance of blocking
    attacks that might be hiding in encrypted\n   network traffic.  This report includes
    data from multiple sources.\n   Some of that data is verifiable.\n\n\t </p>\n
