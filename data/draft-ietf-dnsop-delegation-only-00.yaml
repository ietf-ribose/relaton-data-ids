abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that
    indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data across a label. That
    is, every label (dot) underneath is considered a zone cut and must have its own
    (signed) delegation. Additionally, it indicates the zone is expecting its parent
    to never bypass or override the zone. DNSSEC Validating Resolvers can use this
    flag to mark any data that violates the DELEGATION_ONLY policy as BOGUS.</p>"
