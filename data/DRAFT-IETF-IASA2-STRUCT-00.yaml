abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n
    \  established in 2005.  In the 13 years from 2005 to 2018, the needs of\n   the
    IETF have evolved in ways that require changes to its\n   administrative structure.
    \ The purpose of this document is to outline\n   a proposed new \"IASA 2.0\" structure.
    \ The proposal is for the work of\n   the IETF's administrative and fundraising
    tasks to be conducted by a\n   new administrative organization, the IETF Administration
    Limited\n   Liability Corporation (\"LLC\").  Under the proposal, the Internet\n
    \  Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) will be eliminated, and its\n   oversight
    and advising functions transferred to the new LLC Board.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
