abstract:
- content: <p>There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against requests
    from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no response path
    from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource consumption
    in constrained systems while updating a bulk of resources simultaneously, or updating
    a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP already provides Non-confirmable (NON)
    messages that are not acknowledged by the recipient. However, the request/response
    semantics still require the server to respond with a status code indicating "the
    result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request". This specification
    introduces a CoAP option called 'No-Response'. Using this option the client can
    explicitly tell the server to suppress all responses against the particular request.
    This option also provides granular control to enable suppression of a particular
    class of response or a combination of response-classes. This option may be effective
    for both unicast and multicast requests. This document also discusses a few exemplary
    applications which benefit from this option.</p>
