abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP)
    for\nnetwork traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-Based\nSending
    (PBS) NSLP.  This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service\n(DoS) attacks and other
    forms of unauthorized traffic.  PBS NSLP is\nbased on the proactive approach of
    explicitly granting permissions\nand the reactive approach of monitoring and reacting
    against the\nattacks.  Signaling installs and maintains the permission state of\nrouters
    for a data flow.  PBS NSLP uses two security mechanisms:\nmessage security in
    an end-to-end fashion and channel security in a\nhop-by-hop fashion.  The message
    security is for protecting the\nintegrity of the message on end-to-end traffic
    and channel security\nis for protecting the integrity and confidentiality between
    adjacent\nnodes.  These security mechanisms enable the secure distribution of\nshared
    keys, as well as protection of signaling messages.  To\nauthenticate data packets,
    the PBS NSLP requests a sender to use an\nexisting security protocol, the IPsec
    Authentication Header (AH).\nThis allows routers to drop bogus packets by using
    an IP packet\nfilter.  To avoid a compromised router that drops legitimate packets,\nthe
    PBS NSLP triggers the sender to change the data flow path.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis
