abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Discovery of the Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP
    area or\n   routing domain is possible using OSPF and IS-IS IGP discovery.\n   However,
    it has been established that in certain deployment scenarios\n   PCEs may not
    wish, or be able to participate within the IGP process.\n   In those scenarios,
    it is beneficial for the Path Computation Client\n   (PCC) (or other PCE) to discover
    PCEs via an alternative mechanism to\n   using an IGP discovery.\n\n   This document
    specifies the requirements, use cases, procedures and\n   extensions to support
    PCE discovery along with certain relevant\n   information type and capability
    discovery via DNS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
