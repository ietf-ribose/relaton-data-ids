abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Self-certifying names are one way of binding a given public
    key to a\n   certain name in Information Centric Networking.  However, an\n   additional
    binding of a self-certifying name to a Real-World identity\n   is needed in most
    cases, so that a recipient of some information\n   cannot only verify that the
    publisher was in possession of the\n   correct corressponding private key for
    the requested name, but that\n   in addition the name itself is the intended one.
    \ This draft\n   specifies how such a binding of Real-World identities with self-\n
    \  certifying ICN names can be done, taking existing IETF specifications\n   into
    account.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
