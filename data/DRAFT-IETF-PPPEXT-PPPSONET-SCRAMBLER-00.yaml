abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface defined\nin
    the IETF RFC 1619 and its application in public Internet backbone\nnetworks. By
    experimental analysis it is found that this SONET interface\nspecification is
    deficient in providing payload transparency. This\ndeficiency leads to deleterious
    effects in providing reliable network\noperations. A simple SONET payload scrambler
    enhancement is proposed to overcome this deficiency. This work has been brought
    to the\nANSI T1X1.5 as an action item for the addition of the RFC 1619 mapping\nto
    T1.105 with a scrambler to be determined by T1X1.\n \nWe are submitting the same
    proposal to IETF now with the interest to\nenhance RFC-1619 accordingly and achieve
    alignment with ANSI T1 standards.\nTo facilitate this alignment, we have recommended
    that T1X1 establish a\nformal liaison with IETF in regard to IP/SONET interface
    standards\nand associated IP transmission standards development.\n\t </p>\n      "
