abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space, several techniques
    have been proposed to share the same IPv4 address among several uses. As an alternative
    to introducing a level of NAT in the provider's core network, this document provides
    a mechanism to assign non-overlapping layer 4 port sets to users assigned with
    the same IPv4 address: Port Set DHCPv4 Option.</p>"
