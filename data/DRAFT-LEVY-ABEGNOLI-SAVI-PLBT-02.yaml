abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Different documents [savi-fcfs] [savi-dhcp] [savi-send] propose\ndifferent
    preference schemes to resolve binding entry collisions\n(same L3 address, different
    binding anchors) based of the address-\nassignment method that they cover.  For
    instance [fcfs] keeps the\nfirst entry and rejects others.  However, in heterogeneous\ndeployments,
    all address-assignment methods co-exist, and there is a\nneed for defining an
    algorithm that compare colliding entries across\nthese different methods (and
    any other method not covered) to pick up\na preferred one.  This document describes
    one such algorithum.\n\t </p>\n      "
