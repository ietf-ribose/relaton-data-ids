abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological
    success\n   in information technology of the last half century.  As Internet\n
    \  become pervasive, IP start replacing communication technology for\n   domain-specific
    solutions.  However, domains with specific\n   requirements as well as communication
    behaviors and semantics still\n   exists and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes
    as \"limited domains\".\n   When communicating within limited domains, the address
    semantic and\n   format may differ with respect to the IP address one.  As such,
    there\n   is a need to adapt the domain-specific addressing to the Internet\n
    \  addressing paradigm.  In certain scenarios, such adaptation may raise\n   challenges.\n\n
    \  This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase\n   possibly
    different addressing requirements which are challenging to\n   be accommodated
    in the IP addressing model.  These scenarios\n   highlight issues related to the
    Internet addressing model and call\n   for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve
    the addressing\n   model so to better accommodate different domain-specific\n
    \  requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
