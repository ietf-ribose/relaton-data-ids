abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label in
    non-DNS contexts or for names that have no meaning in a global context. It also
    provides advice and guidance to developers developing alternate namespaces. [
    Ed note: This document lives in GitHub at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld
    . Issues and pull requests happily accepted. ] [ Question for Working Group. It
    has been proposed that the string .ALT should be replaced with something else
    e.g. .NOT-DNS. As naming discussions in the IETF are always short, simple, and
    not controversial, we figured we should open these for discussion now. We would
    appreciate clear feedback on preference and rationale. ]</p>"
