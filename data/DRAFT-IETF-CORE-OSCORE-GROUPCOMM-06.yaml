abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mode for protecting group communication\n
    \  over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  The proposed mode\n   relies
    on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments\n   (OSCORE) and the CBOR
    Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) format.\n   In particular, it defines how
    OSCORE is used in a group communication\n   setting, while fulfilling the same
    security requirements for group\n   requests and responses.  Source authentication
    of all messages\n   exchanged within the group is provided by means of digital
    signatures\n   produced by the sender and embedded in the protected CoAP messages.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
