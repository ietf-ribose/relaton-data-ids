abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a common misconception that the IPv6 Addressing Architecture
    requires the use of only /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing and on-link determination.
    This document clarifies the characterization of the relationship between IPv6
    routing and the 64-bit boundary in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture, which is
    that of a recommendation for the use of /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing
    and on-link determination in most circumstances, not a requirement for such. To
    further clarify the relationship, the document also provides operational guidance
    for the configuration of subnet prefixes and updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</p>"
