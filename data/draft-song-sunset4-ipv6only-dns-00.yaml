abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment of IPv6-only networks are impacted by assumptions of IPv4-only
    or dual-stack transition scenarios. For example, these assumptions are in the
    operations of DNS. This memo is problem statement and hopes to eventually propose
    a mitigation technique.</p>"
