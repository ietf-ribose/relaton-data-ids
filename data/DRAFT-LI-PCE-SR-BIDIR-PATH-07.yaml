abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The
    Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching
    (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing paths\n   in Segment Routing (SR) TE networks.\n\n
    \  This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse\n   unidirectional
    SR Paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR Path when\n   using a Stateful PCE
    for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as\n   well as when using a Stateless
    PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
