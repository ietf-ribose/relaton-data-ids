abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism
    where\n   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to\n   indicate
    congestion to the end-points.  ECN-capable receivers will\n   feedback this information
    to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in\n   such a way that only one feedback
    signal can be transmitted per\n   Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently, new TCP mechanisms
    like ConEx or\n   DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case
    where\n   more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document\n   specifies
    a different scheme for the ECN feedback in the TCP header\n   to provide more
    than one feedback signal per RTT.  Furthermore this\n   document specifies a re-use
    of the Urgent Pointer in the TCP header\n   if the URG flag is not set to increase
    the robustness of the proposed\n   ECN feedback scheme.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
