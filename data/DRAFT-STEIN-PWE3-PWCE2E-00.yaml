abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PWE3 architecture document places the interworking function\nsolely
    in the PE, so that the attachment circuit between PE and CE\ncarries the native
    service.  This is appropriate for a service\nprovider that offers the customer
    a seamless alternative for\ntransporting the native service.  An alternative is
    to place the\ninterworking function in the CE, with ethernet access from CE to
    PE.\nWe present advantages of this approach and note required changes to\nthe
    PWE architecture.\n\t </p>\n      "
