abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the major advantages of SCTP is supporting multi-homed communication.
    If a multi-homed end-point has a redundant network connections, the SCTP associations
    have a good chance to survive network failures by migrating traffic from inactive
    networks to active ones. However, if the SCTP standard is followed, there can
    be a significant delay during the migration. During this period, SCTP might not
    be able to transmit much data to the peer. This issue drastically impairs the
    usability of SCTP in some situations. This memo describes the issue of the SCTP
    failover mechanism and specifies an alternative failover procedure for SCTP that
    improves its performance during and after failover. The procedures require only
    minimal modifications to the current specification.</p>"
