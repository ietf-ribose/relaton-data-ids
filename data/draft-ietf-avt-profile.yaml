abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a profile called "RTP/AVP" for the use of the
    real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol,
    RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.
    It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable
    for audio and video conferences. In particular, this document defines a set of
    default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document also describes
    how audio and video data may be carried within RTP. It defines a set of standard
    encodings and their names when used within RTP. The descriptions provide pointers
    to reference implementations and the detailed standards. This document is meant
    as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications.
    This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890. It is mostly backwards-compatible except for
    functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found. The
    additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under
    this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published.
