abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the term \"opportunistic security\".  In
    contrast to\n   the established approach of employing protection against both
    passive\n   and active attacks or else (frequently) no protection at all,\n   opportunistic
    security strives to deliver at least some protection\n   most of the time.  The
    primary goal is therefore broad\n   interoperability, with security policy tailored
    to the capabilities\n   of peer systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
