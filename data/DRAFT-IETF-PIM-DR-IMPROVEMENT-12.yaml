abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is a
    widely\n   deployed multicast protocol.  As deployment for the PIM protocol is\n
    \  growing day by day, a user expects lower packet loss and faster\n   convergence
    regardless of the cause of the network failure.  This\n   document defines an
    extension to the existing protocol, which\n   improves the PIM's stability with
    respect to packet loss and\n   convergence time when the PIM Designated Router
    (DR) role changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
