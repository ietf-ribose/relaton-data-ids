abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio\n
    \  technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks\n   based
    on CoAP.  The emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN)\n   present a particular
    set of constraints, which places them at the\n   intersection of infrastructure
    networks, ultra-dense networks, delay-\n   tolerant networks and low-power and
    lossy networks.  The main\n   objectives of LP-WAN signaling is to minimize the
    number of exchanged\n   messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure
    and\n   extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of\n   technology-independence
    (L2-independence).  This document describes\n   the use of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) as the main\n   signaling protocol for LP-WAN, over which minimal
    messages are\n   exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as\n
    \  authentication, authorization, and management.  The use of CoAP\n   signaling
    provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to\n   different LP-WAN technologies.\n\n\t
