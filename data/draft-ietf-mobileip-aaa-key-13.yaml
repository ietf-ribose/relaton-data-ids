abstract:
  content: "<p>AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within theInternet
    today to provide authentication and authorization servicesfor dial-up computers.
    Mobile IP requires strong authenticationbetween the mobile node and its home agent.
    When the mobile nodeshares a AAA security association with its home AAA server,
    however,it is possible to use that security association to create derivedmobility
    security associations between the mobile node and its homeagent, and again between
    the mobile node and the foreign agentcurrently offering connectivity to the mobile
    node. This documentspecifies extensions to Mobile IP registration messages that
    can beused to create mobility security associations between the mobile nodeand
    its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreignagent.</p>"
