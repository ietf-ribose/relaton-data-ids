abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface Identifiers
    to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), such that addresses
    configured using this method are stable within each subnet, but the Interface
    Identifier changes when hosts move from one network to another. This method is
    meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware
    address (e.g., using IEEE identifiers), such that the benefits of stable addresses
    can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy of users. The method specified
    in this document applies to all prefixes a host may be employing, including link-local,
    global, and unique- local addresses.</p>"
