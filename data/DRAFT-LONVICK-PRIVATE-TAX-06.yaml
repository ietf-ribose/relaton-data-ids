abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document attempts to provide some clarification for the
    way that\n   private use fields have been used in protocols developed in the IETF.\n
    \  It is strictly a taxonomy of what has been published and offers a\n   minimal
    amount of advice about how to design or use private use\n   options.\n\n\t </p>\n
