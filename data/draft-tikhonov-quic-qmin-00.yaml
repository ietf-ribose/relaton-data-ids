abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines QMIN, a compression format and protocol
    for HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) headers. QMIN is based on HPACK ([RFC7541]). The modifications
    to HPACK are meant to allow robust compression use in QUIC: That is, no head-of-line
    blocking and low overhead. QMIN is guided by HPACK design principles. It inherits
    all of HPACK's data structures and retains binary compatibility with it. While
    designed with QUIC in mind, QMIN can be used in other contexts.</p>"
