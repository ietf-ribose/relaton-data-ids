abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establish\nshared
    protection LSP tunnels.\nThe method presented enables the set up and reservation
    of resources\nof protection LSPs while sharing the network protection bandwidth.\nThe
    described use of RSVP allows the protection LSP to be established\nwithout changes
    to a pre-existing OSPF-TE protocol. Of course, A 'TE'\nrouting protocol is not
    required, but would be desirable as it would\nreduce the number of crank-backs.
    In the companion draft [Shared-\nOSPF-TE], extensions to OSPF/OSPF-TE are presented
    that enable\nfurther optimized operations to support efficient sharing of\nprotection
    bandwidth.\n\t </p>\n      "
