abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public keysignatures,
    shared secrets and EAP. EAP based authenticationrequires server to maintain information
    about the client until EAPcompletes. Public key based authentication mechanisms
    are highlycomputational intensive and demands server CPU resources.Redirect Mechanism
    for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2 thatenables a VPN gateway to redirect
    the VPN client to another VPNgateway, for example, based on the load condition.IKEv2
    Session Resumption proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows aclient to re-establish
    an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficientmanner, utilizing a previously established
    IKE SA.Redirect mechanism can also be used to redirect a client to anotherrouter
    (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication and an optionalproxy session negotiation
    on behalf of the server. This redirectionhappens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server
    does not maintain anyinformation about the redirected client. After mutual authenticationand
    optional proxy session negotiation trust anchor redirects theclient back to the
    server with an Access Token which can be used as adynamic pre-shared key between
    the server and client for passwordbased IKE_AUTH exchange. Mechanism described
    here allows servers tocompute the same pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting
    trustanchors, based on the information provided by the client duringIKE_AUTH exchange.
    Access Token based authentication permits IDr ofthe responder to be different
    from that specified in Ticket andpermits client to reuse the proxy session (negotiated
    between clientand trust anchor) between client and server.Such a mechanism is
    useful especially for low power devices likehandsets. For example, a mobile node
    can redirect a correspondentnode to its home agent. Home agent can form a proxy
    session withcorrespondent node and then redirect it back to mobile node.Status
