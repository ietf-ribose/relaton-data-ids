abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched\n   Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks is subject to a set of one or more\n   specific optimization
    criteria, referred to as objective functions.\n\n   In the Path Computation Element
    (PCE) architecture, a Path\n   Computation Client (PCC) may want a set of services
    that are required\n   to be diverse (disjointed) from each other.  In case when
    full\n   diversity could not be achieved, it is helpful to maximize diversity\n
    \  as much as possible (or in other words, minimize the common shared\n   resources).\n\n
    \  This document defines objective function code types for three new\n   objective
    functions for this purpose to be applied to a set of\n   synchronized path computation
    requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
