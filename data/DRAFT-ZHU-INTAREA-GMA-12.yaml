abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks,\n
    \  e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly\n   combine the
    connectivity over these networks below the transport\n   layer (L4) to improve
    quality of experience for applications that\n   do not have built in multi-path
    capabilities. Such optimization\n   requires additional control information, e.g.,
    a sequence number,\n   in each packet. This document presents a new light weight
    and\n   flexible encapsulation protocol for this need. The solution has\n   been
    developed by the authors based on their experiences in\n   multiple standards
    bodies including the IETF and 3GPP, is not an\n   Internet Standard and does not
    represent the consensus opinion of\n   the IETF. This document will enable other
    developers to build\n   interoperable implementations in order to experiment with
    the\n   protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
