abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When the path characteristics between two hosts change abruptly,
    TCPcan experience significant delays before resuming transmission in anefficient
    manner or TCP can behave unfairly to competing traffic.This document describes
    TCP extensions that improve transmissionbehavior in response to advisory, lower-layer
    connectivity-changeindications. The proposed TCP extensions modify the local behaviorof
    TCP and introduce a new TCP option to signal locally receivedconnectivity-change
    indications to remote peers. Performance gainsresult from a more efficient transmission
    behavior and there is nodifference in aggressiveness in comparison to a newly-startedconnection.</p>"
