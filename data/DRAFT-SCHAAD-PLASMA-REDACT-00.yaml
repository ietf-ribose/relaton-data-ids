abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Redacted documents are designed to have a single document which\n
    \  allows different individuals to view different portions of the\n   document
    basd on the attributes of the individual.  In this document,\n   a protocol extension
    to the basic PLASMA protocol is described that\n   allows for multiple keys, each
    with a different policy, to be used in\n   a single electronic document for enforcement
    of redaction levels.\n   This document is agnostic relative to the actual format
    of the\n   redacted document, the only requirement being that the redacted\n   document
    be able to carry the PLASMA defined lock box.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
