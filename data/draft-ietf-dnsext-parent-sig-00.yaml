abstract:
  content: "<p>When dealing with large amounts of keys the procedures to update azone
    and to sign a zone need to be clearly defined and practicallypossible. The current
    idea is to have the KEY RR and the parent'sSIG to reside in the child's zone and
    perhaps also in the parent'szone. We feel that this would lead to very complicated
    procedures forlarge TLDs. We propose an alternative scheme in which the parent
    zonestores the parent's signature over the child's key and also a copy ofthe child's
    key itself.</p>"
