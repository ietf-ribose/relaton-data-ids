abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics
    such as cost, delay and delay variation associated with the TE link formed by
    Label Switched Path (LSP) are not available to the ingress and egress nodes. This
    draft provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) to support automatic collection of cost, delay and delay variation information
    for the TE link formed by a LSP.</p>"
