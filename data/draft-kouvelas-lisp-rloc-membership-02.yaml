abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) operation is based on EID
    to RLOC mappings that are exchanged through a mapping system. The mapping system
    can use the RLOCs included in mapping registrations to construct the complete
    set of RLOC addresses across all xTRs that are members of the LISP deployment.
    This set can then be made available by the mapping system to all the member xTRs.
    An xTR can use the RLOC set to optimise protocol operation as well as to implement
    new functionality. This document describes the use of the LISP reliable transport
    session between an xTR and a Map-Server to communicate the contents of the RLOC
    membership set.</p>"
