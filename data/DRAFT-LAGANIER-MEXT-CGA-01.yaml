abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding
    Updates\nsent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair\nof
    unidirectional IPsec security associations between these two\nnodes.  The standard
    mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates\nsent by a Mobile Node to one
    of its Correspondent Nodes relies on the\nuse of a return routability test that
    involves the Correspondent Node\nverifying reachability of the Mobile Node at
    both its Home Address\nand its Care-of Address.  The mechanism also requires the\ncorrespondent
    node to send keying material to both of these\naddresses.\n\nRFC 4866 specifies
    a standard track mecanism that allows a Mobile\nNode that has configured a Cryptographically
    Generated Address (RFC\n3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding
    Updates sent\nits Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its\nCryptographically
    Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically\nGenerated Addresses have also
    been used to counter similar security\nissues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533)
    and Secure Neighbor\nDiscovery (RFC 3971.)\n\nThis memo proposes a mechanism that
    would let a Mobile Node use a\nsimilar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding
    Updates its sent to\nits Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use
    of\nCryptographically Generated Addresses.\n\t </p>\n      "
