abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client
    to\n   communicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes\n   responses
    to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a\n   downstream intermediary
    how its responses should be prioritized when\n   they are forwarded.  This document
    defines the Priority header field\n   for communicating the initial priority in
    an HTTP version-independent\n   manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for
    reprioritizing\n   responses.  These share a common format structure that is designed
    to\n   provide future extensibility.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
