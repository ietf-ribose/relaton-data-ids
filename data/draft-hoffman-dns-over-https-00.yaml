abstract:
  content: "<p>DNS queries sometimes experience problems with end to end connectivity
    at times and places where HTTPS flows freely. HTTPS provides the most practical
    mechanism for reliable end to end communication. Its use of TLS provides integrity
    and confidentiality guarantees and its use of HTTP allows it to interoperate with
    proxies, firewalls, and authentication systems where required for transit. This
    document describes how to run DNS service over HTTP using https:// URIs. [ This
    paragraph is to be removed when this document is published as an RFC ] Comments
    on this draft can be sent to the DNS over HTTP mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp
