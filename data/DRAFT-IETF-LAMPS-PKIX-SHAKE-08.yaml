abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates
    and\n   CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists).  This document describes the\n   conventions
    for using the SHAKE function family in Internet X.509\n   certificates and CRLs
    as one-way hash functions with the RSA\n   Probabilistic signature and ECDSA signature
    algorithms.  The\n   conventions for the associated subject public keys are also\n
    \  described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
