abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 2026 specifies a three-stage Standards Track. As currentlypracticed,
    IETF standards track documents typically attain only thefirst stage. This proposal
    discusses the problems caused by thedisparity between documented procedures and
    actual practice, andproposes a simplified, two-step standard track, which will
    streamlinethe IETF standardization process, with distinct benefits for eachstage.
    Clarification of the criteria for handling documents re-submitted as Proposed
    Standard is also provided.</p>"
