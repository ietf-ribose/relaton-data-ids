abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate Fast
    Re-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing link and node protection of node and adjacency
    segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework. This Fast Re-route (FRR) behavior
    builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs
    with directed forwarding (DLFA). It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed
    coverage in any IGP network. We accommodate the FRR discovery and selection approaches
    in order to establish protection over post-convergence paths from the point of
    local repair, dramatically reducing the operational need to control the tie-breaks
    among various FRR options.</p>"
