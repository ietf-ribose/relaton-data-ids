abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Robocalling has become an increasing problem in the Public
    Switched\n   Telephone Network (PSTN).  A partial remedy for it is the provision\n
    \  of an authenticated caller ID in the PSTN, which today is lacking.\n   Secure
    Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides this through the\n   usage of signed
    payloads in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls.\n   However, STIR deployment
    requires a global certificate system which\n   allows for worldwide issuance of
    certifications that attest to which\n   numbers a provider is responsible for.
    \ Such a system is likely to\n   take years to rollout.  To accelerate STIR deployment,
    this draft\n   proposes a technique wherein STIR can be used without certificates\n
    \  that attest to number ownership.  This is done through a combination\n   of
    self-signed certificates, reverse callbacks and cached\n   validations.\n\n\t
