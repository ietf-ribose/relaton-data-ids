abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the motivation for, and services required of,
    the management of devices deployed in a Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) environment.
    Together, this set of information outlines a conceptual DTN Management Architecture
    (DTNMA) suitable for deployment in any of the challenged and constrained DTN operational
    environments. The DTNMA is supported by two types of asynchronous behavior. First,
    the DTNMA does not presuppose any synchronized transport behavior between managed
    and managing devices. Second, the DTNMA does not support any query-response semantics.
    In this way, the DTNMA allows for operation in extremely challenging conditions,
    to include over uni-directional links and cases where delays/disruptions prevent
    operation over traditional transport layers.</p>"
