abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPv6 stateless auto-configuration(SLAAC) mechanism allows
    a host\nto generate its own addresses using a combination of locally\navailable
    information and information advertised by routers.  This\ndocument describes a
    failure scenario for SLAAC and discusses how\nhosts can recover from this failure
    in a properly configured network.\n\t </p>\n      "
