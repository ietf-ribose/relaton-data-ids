abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Location of a caller is essential to processing an emergency
    call.\n   Location is needed to correctly route the call, and to correctly\n   dispatch
    help to the right place.  Location can be specified in\n   geographic (latitude,
    longitude) or civic (country, province,\n   locality) forms.  This document proposes
    a DNS-based mechanism to\n   lookup emergency calling URIs and related emergency
    information from\n   a known civic location in a specific form.  Other companion
    documents\n   propose a non DNS-based approach to determine civic location from\n
    \  geographic location, and describe how to discover a civic location in\n   the
    appropriate local form(s) for this application.\n\t </p>\n      "
