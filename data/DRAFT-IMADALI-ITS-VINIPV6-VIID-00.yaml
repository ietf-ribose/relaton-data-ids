abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17 characters\n
    \  alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  This\n   code
    is standardized in ISO-3779 and ISO-3780; other standardization\n   bodies' implementation
    of this code (NHTSA, SAE) is compliant with\n   ISO standards.  The VIN is mandatory
    for each vehicle and used as a\n   unique identity.  Some public information related
    to a vehicle can be\n   obtained knowing its VIN code.\n\n   An IPv6 address is
    128 bit in length and its rightmost bits form the\n   Interface Identifier (IID).
    \ When the IPv6 address is used with IPv6-\n   over-Ethernet and Stateless Address
    Auto-Configuration, the length of\n   the IID is 64 bit.\n\n   This document presents
    an experimental method to convert an IPv6\n   Interface Identifier starting from
    the VIN code - the VIID.  The\n   conversion can be reverted - given a VIID formed
    from a VIN it easily\n   possible to find out the original VIN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
