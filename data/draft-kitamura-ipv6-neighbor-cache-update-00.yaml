abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes IPv6 neighbor cache update methods from external
    nodes. In current communication environments, using status of IP addresses is
    frequently changed by several operations, such as disconnecting / connecting nodes
    to networks at mobile environments, suspending / hibernating / resuming nodes,
    and consuming large number of IP addresses dynamically when ephemeral address
    [Ephemeral] function is enabled. When using status of an IP address is changed
    from "Used" to "Not Used", its related used resources such as neighbor cache entry
    should be deleted cooperatively from security enhancement viewpoint and efficient
    resource management viewpoint. [RFC4861] defines neighbor discovery methods and
    describes how to manage neighbor cache entries by neighbor discovery messages.
    However, [RFC4861] does not define quick and clear neighbor cache update (delete)
    functions. In order to meet above request, this document proposes two types of
    IPv6 neighbor cache update (delete) methods from external nodes. One is a heuristic
    type method that does NOT require neighbor discovery message extensions. The other
    is an explicit type method that requires small neighbor discovery message extensions.</p>
