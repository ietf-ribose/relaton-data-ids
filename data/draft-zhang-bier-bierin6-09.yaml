abstract:
- content: <p>BIER is a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets
    without requiring per-flow state inside the network. This document describes how
    the existing BIER encapsulation specified in RFC 8296 works in an IPv6 non-MPLS
    network, referred to as BIERin6. Specifically, like in an IPv4 network, BIER can
    work over L2 links directly or over tunnels. In case of IPv6 tunneling, a new
    IP "Next Header" type is to be assigned for BIER.</p>
