abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo summarizes common ideas on how good mailing lists should
    behave. Some of this is taken from IETF standards, some is not. This memo is not
    intended, itself, to become a standard, but might, if accepted by the IETF, be
    published as informational RFC or as a Best Current Practice (BCP) document.</p>"
