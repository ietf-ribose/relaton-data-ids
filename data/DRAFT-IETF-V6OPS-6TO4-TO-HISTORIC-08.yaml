abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience with the \"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\n
    \  (6to4)\" IPv6 transition mechanism defined in RFC 3056 has shown that\n   the
    mechanism is unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the\n   Internet,
    especially in its anycast mode.  This document requests\n   that RFC 3068, \"An
    Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers\", be made\n   obsolete and moved to historic
    status.  It also recommends that\n   future products should not support 6to4 anycast
    and that existing\n   deployments should be reviewed.  Thus it updates the guidelines
    in\n   RFC 6343.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
