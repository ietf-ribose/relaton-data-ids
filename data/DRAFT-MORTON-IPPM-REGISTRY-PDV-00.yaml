abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,\n
    \  primarily those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance\n   Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF.  Three aspects make IPPM\n   metric registration
    difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow\n   users to specify their own
    packet types. (2) Use of Flexible input\n   variables, called Parameters in IPPM
    definitions, some which\n   determine the quantity measured and others which should
    not be\n   specified until execution of the measurement. (3) Allowing\n   flexibility
    in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a\n   stream of measurement
    packets.  Specifically, this memo investigates\n   registry entries that would
    follow from RFC 3393, the specification\n   IP Packet Delay Variation that allows
    for many different forms of\n   unique metrics, as a difficult and important test
    of the registry\n   structure.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
