abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders
    inform\nthe network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in\nthe
    same flow.  Today, the network may signal congestion to the\nreceiver by ECN markings
    or by dropping packets, and the receiver may\npass this information back to the
    sender in transport-layer feedback.\nThe mechanism to be developed by the ConEx
    WG will enable the sender\nto also relay this congestion information back into
    the network in-\nband at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion
    is\nvisible to all IP devices along the path, from where it could, for\nexample,
    be provided as input to traffic management.\n\t </p>\n      "
