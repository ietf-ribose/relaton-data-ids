abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes PGMCC, a single rate multicast\ncongestion
    control scheme which is TCP-friendly and achieves\nscalability, stability and
    fast response to variations in\nnetwork conditions. PGMCC is suitable for both
    non-reliable\nand reliable data transfers.  It is mainly designed for NAK-\nbased
    multicast protocols, and uses a window-based, TCP-like\ncontrol loop using positive
    ACKs between one representative of\nthe receiver group (the ACKER) and the sender.
    \ The ACKER is\nselected dynamically and may change over time.\nPGMCC is made
    of two components: a window-based control loop,\nwhich closely mimics TCP behaviour,
    and a fast and low-\noverhead procedure to select (and track changes of) the ACKER.\nThe
    scheme is robust to measurement errors, and supports fast\nresponse to changes
    in the receiver set and/or network\nconditions.\n\t </p>\n      "
