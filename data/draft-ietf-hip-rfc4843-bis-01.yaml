abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic HashIdentifiers
    (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address-like identifiers. These
    identifiers are intended to be used asendpoint identifiers at applications and
    Application ProgrammingInterfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location
    at theIP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as applicationlayer
    entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should notappear in actual IPv6
    headers. To make them more like vanilla IPv6addresses, they are expected to be
    routable at an overlay level.Consequently, while they are considered non-routable
    addresses fromthe IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications areexpected
    to be able to use them in a manner compatible with currentIPv6 addresses.This
    document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of theIPv6 addressing
    space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic HashIdentifiers. By default, the prefix
    will be returned to IANA in2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus.</p>"
