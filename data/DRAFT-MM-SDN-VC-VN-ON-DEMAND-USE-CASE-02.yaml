abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize
    and\n   abstract the network and presents the virtual/abstract resources to\n
    \  the third-party applications/software.  The applications/software\n   can,
    by the programmable interface or Northbound API, request,\n   manipulate and monitor
    the services that the network provided.  With\n   this SDN capability, more innovative
    services can be introduced and\n   rapidly deployed.  Additionally, existing services
    can be deployed\n   and managed in a much more simple way.\n\n   This document
    outlines two use cases that leverage the SDN\n   architecture/model to implement
    a kind of \"self-help\" and automated\n   set of network services: Virtual Connection
    on Demand (VCoD) and\n   Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
