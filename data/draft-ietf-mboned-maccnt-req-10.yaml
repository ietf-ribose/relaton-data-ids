abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and accesscontrol
    for IP multicasting. The scope of the requirements islimited to cases where Authentication,
    Accounting and Authorization(AAA) functions are coordinated between Content Provider(s)
    andNetwork Service Provider(s).In order to describe the new requirements of a
    multi-entity ContentDeliver System(CDS) using multicast, the memo presents three
    basicbusiness models: 1) the Content Provider and the Network Provider arethe
    same entity, 2) the Content Provider(s) and the NetworkProvider(s) are separate
    entities and users are not directly billed,and 3) the Content Provider(s) and
    the Network Provider(s) areseparate entities and users are billed based on content
    consumptionor subscriptions. The requirements of these three models are listedand
    evaluated as to which aspects are already supported by existingtechnologies and
    which aspects are not.General requirements for accounting and admission controlcapabilities
    including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues arelisted and the constituent
    logical functional components arepresented.This memo assumes that the capabilities
    can be realized byintegrating AAA functionalities with a multicast CDS system,
    withIGMP/MLD at the edge of the network.</p>"
