abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EDNS0 enables a DNS server to send large responses using UDP
    and is\n   widely deployed.  Path MTU discovery remains widely undeployed due
    to\n   security issues, and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses in\n   application
    protocols.  Currently, DNS is known to be the largest\n   user of IP fragmentation.
    \ It is possible to avoid IP fragmentation\n   in DNS by limiting response size
    where possible, and signaling the\n   need to upgrade from UDP to TCP transport
    where necessary.  This\n   document proposes to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
