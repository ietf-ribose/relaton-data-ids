abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Key Exchange Mechanism is primarily
    used\n   in constrained environments where resource intensive Asymmetric\n   Cryptography
    cannot be used. In the Internet of Things (IoT)\n   deployments, constrained devices
    are commonly used for collecting\n   data via sensors for use in home automation,
    smart energy etc. In\n   this context, DTLS is being considered as the primary
    protocol for\n   communication security at the application layer and in some cases,
    it\n   is also being considered for network access authentication.\n\n   This
    document provides a specification for a new extension for\n   Optimizing DTLS
    and TLS Handshake when the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based\n   Key Exchange is used.
    This extension is aimed at reducing the number\n   of messages exchanged and the
    RTT of the TLS &amp; DTLS Handshakes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
