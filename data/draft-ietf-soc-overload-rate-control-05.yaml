abstract:
- content: "<p>The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in Next Generation
    Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide adequate control mechanisms to
    maintain transaction throughput by preventing congestion collapse during traffic
    overloads. Already a loss-based solution to remedy known vulnerabilities of the
    SIP 503 (service unavailable) overload control mechanism has been proposed. This
    document proposes a rate-based control scheme to complement the loss-based control
    scheme, using the same signaling.</p>"
