abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends
    onpacket interception to identify the nodes that should participate insignalling
    sessions. The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis ofthe packet header as the
    interception algorithm. This documentdescribes an experimental extension to GIST
    to use the Router AlertOption (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency. It describes
    thetradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on legacyequipment
    and protocol deployability, and also the considerations tobe taken into account
    in selecting values for the RAO value field.</p>"
