abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the goals of the authors of Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-Based
    Service Discovery (DNS-SD) was to retire AppleTalk and the AppleTalk Name Binding
    Protocol (NBP) and to replace them with an IP-based solution.  This document presents
    a brief overview of the capabilities of AppleTalk NBP and outlines the properties
    required of an IP-based replacement.\n\t </p>\n      "
