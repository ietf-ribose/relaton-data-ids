abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft discusses a mechanism for reporting on failures\nto
    fulfil an SNMP request, in somewhat more detail than is\ncurrently possible.  This
    includes both providing a textual\ndescription of the error, and reporting on
    more than one\nproblem with an individual request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
