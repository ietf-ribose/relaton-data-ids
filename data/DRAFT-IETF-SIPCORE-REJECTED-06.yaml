abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.
    \ This\n   response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary\n
    \  rejected their call attempt.  The call will not be answered.  As a\n   6xx
    code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact\n   the same UAS
    will likely fail.  The present use case driving the need\n   for the 608 response
    code is when the intermediary is an analytics\n   engine.  In this case, the rejection
    is by a machine or other\n   process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted)
    SIP response code,\n   which a human at the target UAS indicated the call was
    not wanted.\n   In some jurisdictions this distinction is important.  This document\n
    \  also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses\n   to
    enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their\n   calls in error.
    \ This provides a remediation mechanism for legal\n   callers that find their
    calls blocked.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
