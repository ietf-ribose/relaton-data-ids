abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Secure transport protocols often consist of three logically
    distinct\n   components: transport, control (handshake), and record protection.\n
    \  Typically, such a protocol contains a single module that is\n   responsible
    for all three functions.  However, in many cases, this\n   coupling is unnecessary.
    \ For example, while cryptographic context\n   and endpoint capabilities need
    to be known before encrypted\n   application data can be sent on a specific transport
    connection,\n   there is otherwise no technical constraint that a cryptographic\n
    \  handshake must be performed on said connection.  This document\n   recommends
    a logical separation between transport, control, and\n   record components of
    secure transport protocols.  We compare existing\n   protocols such as Transport
    Layer Security, QUIC, and IKEv2+ESP in\n   the context of this logical separation.\n\n\t
