abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is
    used\nto negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in\nthe
    case of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode\nregistration.  This mechanism
    allows the mobile node to negotiate\nwhich type of traffic to be delivered encapsulated
    to the foreign\nagent while delivering other types of IP packets using direct\ndelivery
    style.  In particular, this mechanism gives the flexibility\nto eliminate tunnel
    overhead in the (typically) wireless medium\nbetween the mobile node and the foreign
    agent.  In addition to the\nreduced overhead, the new mechanism makes many multicast
    and\nbroadcast services available to the mobile node in a much more\ndeterministic
    and efficient way.\n\t </p>\n      "
