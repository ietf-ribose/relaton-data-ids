abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft specifies CEQMM, a Complete and Efficient Quality
    of \n   Service (QoS) Model for MANETs which combines the positive aspects \n
    \  of both IntServ and DiffServ. It uses a hybrid per-flow and per-class\n   provisioning
    scheme. In such a scheme, traffic of highest priority is\n   given per-flow provisioning
    while other priority classes are given\n   per-class provisioning. To offer this
    scheme and to ensure that\n   certain packets receive higher priority transmission
    than other \n   packets, priority classifier, active queue management and packet
    \n   scheduler are integrated. CEQMM applies the QOLSR protocol to support\n   multiple-metric
    routing criteria and to respond quickly when changes\n   in topology and/or QoS
    conditions are detected. Once a path is chosen\n   for one QoS flow, CEQMM performs
    call admission control (CAC) at each\n   intermediate node. For only QoS flows
    of highest priority, a node can\n   precede to soft and later hard bandwidth reservation
    on links during\n   the CAC process.  CEQMM implements congestion avoidance mechanisms
    to\n   prevent a network from entering the congested state.  However, in\n   MANETs,
    network congestion can still occur frequently under mobility.\n   In order to
    prevent performance degradation due to mobility-triggered\n   congestion, CEQMM
    uses congestion control scheme based on: (i) rated\n   control of best-effort
    traffic, (ii) path selection for best-effort\n   traffic, (iii) next hop maintaining
    for each QoS class (except the \n   high-priority class), (iv) active queue management
    and (v) backoff\n   timer method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
