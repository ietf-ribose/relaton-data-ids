abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    Router\n   Advertisement message defines an 8-bit prefix length field.  Prefix\n
    \  List entries are created using the prefix length in the Prefix\n   Information
    Option.  The Conceptual Model of a Host described in RFC\n   4861[RFC4861] does
    not clarify behavior of a host, when a short\n   prefix length is received.  This
    document updates RFC 4861(if\n   approved), and clarifies that hosts SHOULD NOT
    accept prefix length\n   shorter than /64.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
