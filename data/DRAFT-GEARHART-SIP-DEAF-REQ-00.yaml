abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SIP is attracting more and more attention as a valuable tool to\nenable
    and support voice and multimedia communications over the\nInternet.  However,
    a significant number of potential customers\nfor SIP-based services are for various
    reasons unable to, or\nchoose not to, use voice communication technologies. This
    document\noffers a proposed set of requirements and identifies some of the\nkey
    issues that need resolution to allow full accessibility for\nthis group to SIP-based
    Internet communications. This document is\nintended to continue the discussion
    begun in a previous draft (see\nAcknowledgements) and to lay a foundation for
    design and\nimplementation discussions in future drafts.\n\t </p>\n      "
