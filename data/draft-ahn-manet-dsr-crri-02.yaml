abstract:
- content: "<p>In DSR, a node can generate a route reply in response to a received
    route request if it has a fresh route to the destination in its route cache. However,
    this can incur the cached route reply implosion problem and DSR just tries to
    mitigate this problem by reducing the possibility of cached route reply collisions.
    This document describes how DSR can be extended for the resolution of the cached
    route reply problem.</p>"
