abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS 1.3 is sometimes used in situations where it is necessary to inject
    extra key material into the handshake. This draft aims to describe methods for
    doing so securely. This key material must be injected in such a way that both
    parties agree on what is being injected and why, and further, in what order.</p>"
