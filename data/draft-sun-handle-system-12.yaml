abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the Handle System in terms of
    its namespace and service architecture, as well as its relationship to other Internet
    services such as DNS, LDAP/X.500, and URNs. The Handle System is a general-purpose
    global name service that allows secured name resolution and administration over
    networks such as the Internet. The Handle System manages handles, which are unique
    names for digital objects and other Internet resources.</p>"
