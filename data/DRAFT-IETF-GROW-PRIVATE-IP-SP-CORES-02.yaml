abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of
    the\n   potential problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally-\n   routable
    addressing within the core of an SP network.  The discussion\n   focuses on link
    addresses and to a small extent loopback addresses.\n   While many of the issues
    are well recognised within the ISP\n   community, there appears to be no document
    that collectively\n   describes the issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
