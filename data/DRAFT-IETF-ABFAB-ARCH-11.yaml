abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred
    in the\n   space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has\n   focused
    on two use cases: network access and web-based access.\n   However, the solutions
    to these use cases that have been proposed and\n   deployed tend to have few building
    blocks in common.\n\n   This memo describes an architecture that makes use of
    extensions to\n   the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and
    non-\n   federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial\n
    \  In User Service (RADIUS) the Generic Security Service Application\n   Program
    Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible Authentication Protocol\n   (EAP) and the
    Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  The\n   architecture addresses the
    problem of federated access management to\n   primarily non-web-based services,
    in a manner that will scale to\n   large numbers of identity providers, relying
    parties, and\n   federations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
