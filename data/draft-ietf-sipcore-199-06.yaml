abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    response code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated, that a SIP forking proxy and a User
    Agent Server (UAS) can use to indicate to upstream SIP entities (including the
    User Agent Client (UAC)) that an early dialog has been terminated, before a final
    response is sent towards the SIP entities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
