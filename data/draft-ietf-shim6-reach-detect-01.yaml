abstract:
  content: <p>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allowsmultihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication betweenthe initially chosen addresses
    for a transport session is no longerpossible, a "shim" layer makes it possible
    to switch to a differentset of addresses without breaking current transport protocolassumptions.
    This draft discusses the issues of detecting failuresin a currently used address
    pair between two hosts and picking anew address pair to be used when a failure
    occurs. The input forthese processes are ordered lists of local and remote addressesthat
    are reasonably likely to work. (I.e., not include addressesthat are known to be
    unreachable for local reasons.) These listsmust be available at both ends of the
    communication, although theordering may differ. Building these address lists from
    locallyavailable information and synchronizing them with the remote endare outside
    the scope of this document.This text is for the most part based on discussions
    on the multi6list, several multi6 design team lists and the shim6 list, withnotable
    contributions from Erik Nordmark, Marcelo Bagnulo and JariArkko. Suggestions and
    additions are more than welcome.</p>
