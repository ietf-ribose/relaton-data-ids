abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 2119 defines words that are used in IETF standards documents
    to\nindicate standards compliance.  These words are fine for defining new\nprotocols,
    but there are certain deficiencies in using them when it\ncomes to protocol maintainability.
    \ Protocols are maintained by\neither updating the core specifications or via
    changes in protocol\nregistries.\n\nFor example, security functionality in protocols
    often relies upon\ncryptographic algorithms that are defined in external documents.\nCryptographic
    algorithms have a limited life span, and new algorithms\nregularly phased in to
    replace older algorithms.\n\nThis document proposes standard terms to use in protocol
    registries\nand possibly in standards track and informational documents to\nindicate
    the life cycle support of protocol features and operations.\n\t </p>\n      "
