abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a nested NEMO Route Opimization (NNRO)\n
    \  protocol for the communications between any two nodes in the same\n   nested
    mobile network.  A nested NEMO Route Opimization message is\n   used to exchange
    the routing information between two mobile network\n   nodes in the same nested
    mobile network.  The protocol is designed in\n   a way such that the mobility
    of the entire nested mobile network is\n   transparent to the nodes therein.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
