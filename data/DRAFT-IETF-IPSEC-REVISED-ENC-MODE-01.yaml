abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ISAKMP/Oakley document [HC97] describes a proposed standard
    for\n   using the Oakley Key Exchange Protocol in conjunction with ISAKMP to\n
    \  obtain authenticated and secret keying material for use with ISAKMP,\n   and
    for other security associations such as AH and ESP for the IETF\n   IPsec DOI.\n
    \n   The public-key encryption method of carrying out Phase 1 of the key\n   exchange
    in the ISAKMP/Oakley document provides significant security\n   advantages over
    the other alternatives and should be the method of\n   choice in many implementations.
    Unfortunately, as currently\n   described in [HC97] the method requires two public
    key\n   encryption and decryption operations from both the Initiator and\n   the
    Responder. The present document describes a small modification\n   to this method.
    The resulting scheme requires only one public key\n   encryption and decryption
    operation from each party, while maintaining\n   (and even improving on) the strong
    security properties of the\n   ISAKMP/Oakley public-key encryption mode.\n \n
    \  Remark: This document is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an\n   addendum
    to the authentication methods defined in [HC97].\n   In particular, it uses notation
    and definitions of [HC97].\n   Thus, it is best read in conjunction with [HC97].\n\t
