abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained\n
    \  devices.  Access to existing MIBs is included.  The proposed\n   integration
    of CoAP with SNMP reduces the code size by removing an\n   important part of the
    SNMP code.  The draft lists a set of CoMI\n   objects that describe the operational
    settings of the applications on\n   the device.  A majority of them is taken over
    from other drafts to\n   provide one uniform CoMI based access.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion
    and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
