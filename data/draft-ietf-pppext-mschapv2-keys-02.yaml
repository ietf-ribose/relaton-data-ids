abstract:
  content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method fortransporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. The PPP Compression Control
    Protocol [2] provides a method to negotiateand utilize compression protocols over
    PPP encapsulated links. Version 2 of the Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication
    Protocol(MS-CHAP-2) [3] is a Microsoft-proprietary PPP authentication protocol,providing
    the functionality to which LAN-based users are accustomedwhile integrating the
    encryption and hashing algorithms used on Windowsnetworks.Microsoft Point to Point
    Encryption (MPPE) [4] is a means ofrepresenting PPP packets in an encrypted form.
    MPPE uses the RSA RC4[5] algorithm to provide data confidentiality. The length
    of the ses-sion key to be used for initializing encryption tables can be negoti-ated.
    MPPE currently supports 40-bit and 128-bit session keys. MPPEsession keys are
    changed frequently; the exact frequency depends uponthe options negotiated, but
    may be every packet. MPPE is negotiatedwithin option 18 [6] in the Compression
    Control Protocol. This document describes the method used to derive the initial
    MPPE ses-sion keys from MS-CHAP-2 credentials. The algorithm used to change ses-sion
    keys during a session is described in [4].</p>"
