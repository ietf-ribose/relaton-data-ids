abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the IP Layer metrics and methods to\n
    \  measure the Edge Computing Servers running status and\n   environment for IP
    networks to select the optimal Edge\n   Computing server location in 5G Edge Computing
    (EC)\n   environment. Those measurements are for IP network to\n   dynamically
    optimize the forwarding of 5G edge computing\n   service without any knowledge
    above IP layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
