abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to
    the migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual
    Network Elements (VNEs). VM migration scheme across IP subnets is needed to implement
    virtual computing resources sharing across multiple network administrative domains.
    Many technologies are involved in the VM migration across DCs. These technologies
    are classified and discussed according to their different locations in the inter-DC
    and intra-DC network. For the seamless online migration in various scenarios,
    many problems need to be resolved in the control plane. The VM migration process
    should be adapted to these aspects. We also describe the limitations of various
    types of virtual local area(VLAN) networking technologies and virtual private
    networking (VPN) technologies that are traditionally expected to support such
    migration, mobility, and interconnections.</p>"
