abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a framework of a new scheme for trafficcontrol
    to achieve end-to-end QoS for interactive multimediaservices. The scheme is based
    on end-to-end measurement of networkresources by end systems. The network is assumed
    to fully supportthe priority control scheme specified in the Diffserv architecturefor
    QoS and SIP [1] for session control. Since the scheme relies onthe behavior of
    the end systems, this document also touches onmechanisms for monitoring end-system
    behavior.</p>"
