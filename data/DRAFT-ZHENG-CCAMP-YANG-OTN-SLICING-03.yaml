abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The requirement of slicing network resources with desired quality
    of\n   service is emerging at every network technology, including the\n   Optical
    Transport Networks (OTN).  As a part of the transport\n   network, OTN can provide
    hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation\n   and deterministic low latency, which
    are highly demanded in the\n   Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n\n   This document
    describes a framework for OTN network slicing and a\n   YANG data model augmentation
    of the OTN topology model.  Additional\n   YANG data model augmentations will
    be defined in a future version of\n   this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
