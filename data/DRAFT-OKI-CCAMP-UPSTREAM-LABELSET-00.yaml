abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling
    required\nto support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up.
    \ In\nthe existing drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for the\nupstream
    path has to be reserved at an intermediate node before Path\nmessage is transmitted
    to the next-hop node. On the other hand, a label\nset that includes one or more
    labels for the downstream path is carried\nby Path message and then Resv message
    reserves a label at each interme-\ndiate node on the route or a source node.  This
    document proposes the\nway to support the upstream label set as is the case of
    the Label Set\nfor downstream.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
