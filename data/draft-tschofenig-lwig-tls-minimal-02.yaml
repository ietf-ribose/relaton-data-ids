abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol that
    offers communication security services at the transport layer. The initial design
    of TLS was focused on the protection of applications running on top of the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as a more recent
    connection-oriented transport protocol, also benefits from TLS support. Subsequent
    standardization efforts lead to the publication of the Datagram Transport Layer
    Security (DTLS) protocol, which allows TLS payloads to be exchanged on top of
    the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    (DCCP). TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and every feature has a certain
    cost. To offer input for implementers and system architects this document provides
    guidance for the usage of TLS and DTLS features for smart objects and constraint
    node networks.</p>"
