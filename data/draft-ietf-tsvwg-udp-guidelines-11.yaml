abstract:
- content: "<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing
    transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and
    upper-layer protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ
    mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness
    with concurrent traffic. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for
    the designers of unicast applications and upper-layer protocols. Congestion control
    guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other
    topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, and middlebox traversal.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
