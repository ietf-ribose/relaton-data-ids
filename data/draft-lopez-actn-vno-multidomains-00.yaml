abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating
    the application of virtual network abstractions to network operation. These abstractions
    shall create a virtualized environment supporting operators in viewing and controlling
    different domains (at any dimension: applied technology, administrative zones,
    or vendor-specific technology islands) as a single virtualized network. Such an
    approach will facilitate the deployment of NFV (Network Function Virtualization)
    mechanisms, and accelerate rapid service deployment of new services, including
    more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall network operations and
    scaling of existing services. This use-case considers the application of these
    abstractions within the network of a single operator.</p>"
