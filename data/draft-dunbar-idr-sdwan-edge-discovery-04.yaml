abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes the encoding of BGP UPDATE messages for the
    SDWAN edge node discovery. In the context of this document, BGP Route Reflectors
    (RR) is the component of the SDWAN Controller that receives the BGP UPDATE from
    SDWAN edges and in turns propagates the information to the intended peers that
    are authorized to communicate via the SDWAN overlay network.</p>"
