abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
    version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
    version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.
    The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0,
    and is considered a separate protocol. This document obsoletes RFC 8881. In addition
    to many corrections and clarifications, it relies on NFSv4-wide documents to substantially
    revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization, and security,
    superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the protocol appearing in RFCs
    5661 and 8881.</p>"
