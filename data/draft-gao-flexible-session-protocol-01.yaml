abstract:
- content: "<p>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides
    mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper layer thread
    ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is applied to protect authenticity
    of the origin of the FSP packets. It introduces the concept of transmit transaction
    to facilitate a quad-party sub-protocol for shared secret installation. It provides
    transport layer features of zero round-trip connection multiplication and on-the-wire
    compression, in addition to ubiquitous message authentication with optional encryption
    service.</p>"
