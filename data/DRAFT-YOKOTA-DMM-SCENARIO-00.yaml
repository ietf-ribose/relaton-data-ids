abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document explores applicability of Distributed Mobility\nManagement
    (DMM) and use case scenarios for different parts of the\nmobile network.  DMM
    approaches and scenarios are divided into two\ncases: partially and fully distributed.
    \ For each case, benefits and\nissues are provided.  It also refers to applicability
    of existing\nprotocols and necessity of development of new protocols in order
    to\nprovide a guideline for best suited solutions for the target\narchitecture.\n\t
