abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that
    indicates that this zone will only produce delegation responses for data outside
    of its own apex (or _underscore labels). That is, the Answer Section for queries
    that do not involve the apex (or _underscore labels) of the zone is empty, and
    only glue records in the Authority Section and Additional Section will be acceptable
    data in the response message. Additionally, it indicates that it is not expected
    that the parent of this delegation-only zone bypasses or removes the delegation
    to this zone. DNSSEC Validating Resolvers can use this flag to mark any data that
    violates the DELEGATION_ONLY policy as Bogus.</p>"
