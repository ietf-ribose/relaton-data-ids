abstract:
- content: "<p>Path manager and packet scheduler are two important components of MPTCP
    protocol and associated implementations. Normally they are implemented and configured
    statically. This draft discusses the scenarios where statically configured path
    manager and packet scheduler are not sufficient, and presents the cases that deserve
    the negotiation of these multipath transmission features which are currently not
    addressed by MPTCP.</p>"
