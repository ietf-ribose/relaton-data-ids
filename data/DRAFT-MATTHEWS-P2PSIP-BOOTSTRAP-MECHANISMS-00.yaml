abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes mechanisms that a peer can use to locate
    and\n   establish a Peer Protocol connection to an admitting peer in order to\n
    \  join an overlay network.  In the first mechanism, the joining peer\n   uses
    multicast to locate a bootstrap peer; in the second, the node\n   uses one or
    more bootstrap servers to locate a bootstrap peer; in\n   both cases, the bootstrap
    peer then proxies the request by the\n   joining peer on to the admitting peer.
    \ Each mechanism has its\n   advantages and disadvantages, and a node can utilize
    both.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
