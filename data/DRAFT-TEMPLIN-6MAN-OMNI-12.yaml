abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations, terrestrial\n
    \  vehicles, seagoing vessels, enterprise wireless devices, etc.)\n   communicate
    with networked correspondents over multiple access\n   network data links and
    configure mobile routers to connect end user\n   networks.  A multilink interface
    specification is presented that\n   enables mobile nodes to coordinate with a
    network-based mobility\n   service and/or with other mobile node peers.  This
    document specifies\n   the transmission of IP packets over Overlay Multilink Network
    (OMNI)\n   Interfaces.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
