abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a multicast solution for Segment Routing with
    MPLS data plane. It is consistent with the Segment Routing architecture in that
    an IGP is augmented to distribute information in addition to the link state. In
    this solution it is multicast group membership information sufficient to synchronize
    state in a given network domain. Computation is employed to determine the topology
    of any loosely specified multicast distribution tree.</p>"
