abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides an experimental update to RFC3168.  It updates
    the\n   TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via\n   Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN).  The updated method reduces\n   cwnd by a smaller
    amount than TCP does in reaction to loss.  The\n   intention is to achieve good
    throughput when the queue at the\n   bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product
    of the\n   connection.  This is more likely when an Active Queue Management\n
    \  (AQM) mechanism has used ECN to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet\n   was
    lost.  Future versions of this document will discuss SCTP as well\n   as other
    transports using ECN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
