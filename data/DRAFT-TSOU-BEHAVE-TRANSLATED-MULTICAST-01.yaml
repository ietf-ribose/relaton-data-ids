abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition\nscenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one\nIP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IP\nversion.  Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast group\nwhich is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies a\nstateful translation mechanism whereby the host can obtain its\ndesired
    access using the native multicast capabilities of Network A.\n\t </p>\n      "
