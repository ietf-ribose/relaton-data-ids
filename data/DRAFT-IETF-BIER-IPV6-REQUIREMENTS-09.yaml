abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There have been several proposed solutions with BIER being
    used in\n   IPv6.  But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem\n
    \  and lists the requirements.  The goal of this document is to describe\n   the
    general BIER IPv6 encapsulation problem and detail solution\n   requirements,
    thereby assisting the working group in the development\n   of acceptable solutions.\n\n\t
