abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support
    NFV and\n   Cloud environments, where policies are used to enforce business\n
    \  rules and to specify resource constraints in a number of subsystems.\n   This
    document approaches the policy framework and architecture from\n   the perspective
    of overall orchestration requirements for services\n   involving multiple subsystems.
    The analysis extends beyond common\n   orchestration constraints across compute,
    network, and storage\n   subsystems to also include energy conservation constraints.
    This\n   document also analyses policy scope, global versus local policies,\n
    \  policy actions and translations, policy conflict detection and\n   resolution,
    interactions among policies engines, and a hierarchical\n   policy architecture/framework
    to address the demanding and growing\n   requirements of NFV and Cloud environments.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
