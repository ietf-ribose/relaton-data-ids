abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information in order to allow applications to make\n   informed decisions.
    \ The present draft proposes to extend the cost\n   information provided by the
    ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden\n   the decision possibilities of applications
    to not only decide 'where'\n   to connect to, but also 'when'.  This is useful
    to applications that\n   have a degree of freedom on when to schedule data transfers,
    such as\n   non- instantaneous data replication between data centers or service\n
    \  provisioning to end systems with irregular connectivity.  ALTO\n   guidance
    to schedule application traffic can also efficiently help\n   for load balancing
    and resources efficiency.\n\n   The draft specifies a new Cost Mode, \"Calendar\"
    Mode, that is\n   applicable to time-sensitive ALTO metrics and allows Applications
    to\n   carefully schedule their connections or data transfers.  In the\n   Calendar
    Mode, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO Cost Values in JSON arrays\n   where each value
    corresponds to a given time interval.  The time\n   intervals as well as other
    Calendar attributes are specified in the\n   IRD.  Besides the functional time-shift
    enhancement the ALTO Cost\n   Calendar also allows to schedule the ALTO requests
    themselves and\n   thus save a number of ALTO transactions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
