abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a DHT based distributed EID-to-RLOC mappingmethod.
    The distributed EID-to-RLOC mapping is stored in an overlay,which is different
    from the data forwarding plane, and made up by DHTrings. The DHT based overlay
    is deployed in an AS, and the inter-AScommunication is through DHT Border Server,
    which in located in theborder of DHT rings. The DHT Border Server is used to flood
    thecross routing and forward the cross domain data packet. The DHTbased Distributed
    mapping system is a hybrid push and pull method.</p>"
