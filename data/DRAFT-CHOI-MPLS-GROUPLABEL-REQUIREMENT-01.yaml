abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As the group communication become more important, the special
    label \nshould be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. \nThe
    allocation mechanism of a group label can be applied to a point-\nto-multipoint(P2MP)
    communication in MPLS networks. Currently used \nlabel is locally significant,
    while this group label should be common \nobject within a single MPLS domain.
    \nThis document presents a set of requirements for multicast service \nusing a
    group label over Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS). It \nidentifies functional
    and performance capabilities required to \nallocate a group label in master-slave
    network and peer to peer \nnetwork, which facilitates efficient and reliable group
    communication \nand Quality of Service(QoS) in MPLS domain. It also identifies
    \nfunctional capabilities required to implement several services \nrelated to
    Content Distribution Network(CDN) in master-slave network.\n\t </p>\n      "
