abstract:
  content: "<p>The more and more complicated IP networks require a new interaction
    mechanism between their customers and their networks. A service description language
    is needed to enable customers to easily describe their diverse service requirements.
    SDN controller would compile these service requirements into device configurations.
    This document analyzes requirements for such service description language and
    gives considerations for designing such service description language.</p>"
