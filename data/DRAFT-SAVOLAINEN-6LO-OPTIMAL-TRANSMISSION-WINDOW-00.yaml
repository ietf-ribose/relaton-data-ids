abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a class of gateways an activation of an uplink network\n
    \  connection, such as cellular radio connection, incurs a fixed cost in\n   form
    of consumed energy.  For these gateways minimizing the number of\n   uplink activations
    is of importance.  This specification describes an\n   Optimal Transmission Window
    option for ICMPv6 Router Advertisement\n   that a gateway can use to communicate
    optimal transmission window for\n   nodes it is serving, thus helping to group
    separate transmissions\n   together and thereby reduce number of gateway's uplink
    connection\n   activation events.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
