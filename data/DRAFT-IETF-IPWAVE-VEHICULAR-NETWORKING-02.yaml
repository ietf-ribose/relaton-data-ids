abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses use cases, survey, and problem statement
    on\n   IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of\n
    \  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of\n   vehicular
    networking are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-\n   infrastructure (V2I),
    and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) networking.\n   First, this document surveys
    use cases using V2V and V2I networking.\n   Second, this document deals with some
    critical aspects in vehicular\n   networking, such as vehicular network architectures,
    standardization\n   activities, IP address autoconfiguration, routing, mobility\n
    \  management, DNS naming service, service discovery, and security and\n   privacy.
    \ For each aspect, this document discusses problem statement\n   to analyze the
    gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and\n   requirements in IP-based vehicular
    networking.  Finally, this\n   document articulates discussions including the
    summary and analysis\n   of vehicular networking aspects and raises deployment
    issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
