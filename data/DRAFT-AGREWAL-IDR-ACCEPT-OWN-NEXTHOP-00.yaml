abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Various Service chain techniques utilize a Controller to inject\n
    \  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes to\n   help
    steer traffic through a given path.  The Controller does so by\n   controlling
    how these VPN routes are imported into various Virtual\n   Routing and Forwarding
    (VRF) tables at routers along the desired\n   path.  A couple of such approaches
    are specified in\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-service-chaining].  These approaches rely
    on the\n   Controller modifying the Route Target (RT) list and next-hop of a VPN\n
    \  route received from a downstream router and redistributing these\n   modified
    routes to upstream routers.  This is done such that -\n\n   o  routes originated
    by an ingress VRF at the downstream router are\n      imported into the egress
    VRF at the immediately preceding upstream\n      router and\n\n   o  next-hop
    advertised to the upstream router is the address of the\n      immediately succeeding
    downstream router.\n\n   This forces the traffic to flow through a sequence of
    network\n   functions creating a service chain.\n\n   This works fine as long
    as the VRF importing the route received from\n   the Controller is on a different
    router than the VRF that originally\n   exported the route to the Controller.
    \ This is because BGP protocol\n   [RFC4271] specifies that a router reject routes
    received with its own\n   next-hop.  This document proposes a new community the
    reception of\n   which relaxes this particular rule in the BGP protocol standard
    and\n   describes at least one way of how next-hops of such routes could be\n
    \  resolved.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
