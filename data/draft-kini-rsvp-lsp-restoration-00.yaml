abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label
    switched paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with bandwidthguarantees.
    The reliability of these LSPs can be increased by providinga backup LSP onto which
    traffic can be switched upon failure of anelement in the path of the active LSP.
    Backup LSPs can be routed in away that bandwidth can be shared between backup
    links of more than oneactive path while still guaranteeing recoverability for
    a set offailures. This sharing greatly increases the network efficiency therebyincreasing
    the number of LSPs that can be carried while maintainingguarantees. Algorithms
    which can route such recoverable LSPs whileusing only aggregate network usage
    information are being developed.Keeping these algorithms as the primary motivation
    this documentdescribes a mechanism to signal shared backup LSPs using RSVP.</p>"
