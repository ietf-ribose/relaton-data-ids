abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the methodology and results of an experiment which
    tested the availability of the DNS Extension Mechanism (EDNS0) on a large set
    of authority-only nameservers. The experiment was conducted in the bar during
    the IETF 72 meeting on 27 July 2008. The results of this experiment suggest that
    EDNS0 deployment is extensive: it was found that 94.4% of non-defective authority-only
    servers are EDNS0-capable.</p>"
