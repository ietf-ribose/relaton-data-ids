abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 2026 and some of its predecessors require that Proposed and
    Draft\nStandards either advance in grade within a reasonable period of time\nor
    that they expire and be moved to Historic.  That procedure has\nnever been followed
    on a systematic basis.  A new procedure has been\nproposed that would make that
    action easier for protocols that have\nnot gotten any real acceptance.  In the
    interest of symmetry,\nfairness, and an orderly attic, it is worth noting that
    there are a\nnumber of protocol descriptions which have been at less than Full\nStandard
    level for a long time but which have proven their value by\nthe traditional criteria
    of multiple interoperable implementations\nThis document provides a procedure
    for upgrading such documents to\nFull Standards without creating an unreasonable
    burden on authors\npurely to meet the needs of procedural rituals or placing an\nunreasonable
    load on groups charged with performing other tasks in\nthe IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
