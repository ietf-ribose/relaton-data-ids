abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n
    \  applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing
    business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of
    new services.\n\n   New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n
    \  including the optimization of network functions through application\n   control.
    \ This control could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy
    or orchestrated in a centralized manner.\n\n   The current version of the Application-based
    Policy for Network\n   Functions (APONF) proposed working group mentions the NSIS
    framework\n   as a possible signaling protocol, through the definition of a new\n
    \  NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The present memo analyses if\n   this
    proposition is suitable for the designed purpose and if other\n   protocols would
    be more suitable.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
