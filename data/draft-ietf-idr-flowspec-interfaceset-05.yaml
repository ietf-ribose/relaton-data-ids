abstract:
- content: <p>The BGP Flow Specification (flowspec) Network Layer Reachability Information
    (BGP NLRI) extension (draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis) is used to distribute traffic
    flow specifications into BGP. The primary application of this extension is the
    distribution of traffic filtering policies for the mitigation of distributed denial
    of service (DDoS) attacks. By default, flow specification filters are applied
    on all forwarding interfaces that are enabled for use by the BGP flowspec extension.
    A network operator may wish to apply a given filter selectively to a subset of
    interfaces based on an internal classification scheme. Examples of this include
    "all customer interfaces", "all peer interfaces", "all transit interfaces", etc.
    This document defines BGP Extended Communities (RFC4360) that allow such filters
    to be selectively applied to sets of forwarding interfaces sharing a common group
    identifier. The BGP Extended Communities carrying this group identifier are referred
    to as the BGP Flowspec "interface-set" Extended Communities.</p>
