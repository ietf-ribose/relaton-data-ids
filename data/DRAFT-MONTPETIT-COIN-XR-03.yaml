abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), combined as
    Extended\n   Reality or XR, challenge networking technologies and protocols\n
    \  because they combine the features of fast information display, image\n   processing,
    computing and forwarding.  This document presents some of\n   these challenges
    and how adding computing in the network could\n   respond to them.\n\n\t </p>\n
