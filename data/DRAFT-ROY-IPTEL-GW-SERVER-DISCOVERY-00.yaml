abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This contribution describes a discovery protocol that can be used\nbetween
    gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-\nITAD communications
    environment. The entities work in peer-to-peer\nmode to discover each other. A
    peer can find which peer(s) to\nregister with based on policy. Each peer can also
    decide whether\ncapabilities should also be taken into consideration during the\ndiscovery
    process before they proceed for registration. The\ndiscovery protocol will be
    a part for building a single unified\nintra-ITAD protocol described in a following
    contribution. The\nmessage formats of the intra-ITAD protocol including the discovery\nmessage
    are similar to TRIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
