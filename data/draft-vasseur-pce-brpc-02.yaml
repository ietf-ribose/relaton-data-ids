abstract:
  content: "<p>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)and Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (wherea domain is referred to as a collection
    of network elements within acommon sphere of address management or path computationalresponsibility
    such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems) has beenidentified as a key requirement
    . This document specifies aprocedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation
    Elements(PCEs) in order to compute such inter-domain shortest constraintpaths
    along a determined sequence of domains, using a backwardrecursive path computation
    technique while preserving confidentialityacross domains, which is sometimes required
    when domains are managedby different Service Providers.</p>"
