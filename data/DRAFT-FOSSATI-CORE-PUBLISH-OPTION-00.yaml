abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP).\n\n   The Publish Option is used by a sleepy node to temporarily
    delegate\n   the authority of one of its resources to another, always on, node\n
    \  which is typically a proxy but doesn't need to be necessarily.\n\n   The sleepy
    node is given a simple RESTful messaging protocol that\n   enables the setup,
    renew and removal of the authority transfer.  The\n   whole process is driven
    by the (sleepy) origin, which may actually\n   never need to listen or to keep
    any state.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
