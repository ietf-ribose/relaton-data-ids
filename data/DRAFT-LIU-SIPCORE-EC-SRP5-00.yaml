abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the way that the elliptic curve secure
    remote\n   protocol (EC-SRP) is applied to SIP authentication. SIP Client and\n
    \  server perform mutual authenticate by using the modern 'zero\n   knowledge'
    method without disclosing the password in the process. It\n   has low computation
    complexity and low bandwidth consumption due to\n   the use of elliptical curve
    cryptography. This makes it more suitable\n   for resource-constrained environments,e.g.
    wireless network. The\n   security of the scheme is based on the computational
    intractability\n   of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. It is resilient
    to\n   various kinds of attacks, including off-line dictionary attacks.\n\n\n\n\t
