abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain
    to\n   know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the\n   routing
    domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3 for advertising
    optional router capabilities.  A new Router\n   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement
    (LSA) is proposed for this\n   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented
    with a new opaque\n   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented
    with a new\n   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be\n
    \  advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or\n   autonomous
    system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by\n   providing a revised specification
    including support for advertisement\n   of multiple instances of the RI LSA and
    a TLV for functional\n   capabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
