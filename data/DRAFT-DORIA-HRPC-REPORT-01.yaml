abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an overview snapshot of the HRPC project
    to\n   map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to\n
    \  human rights, with a focus on the promotion and protection of the\n   freedom
    of expression and of association.\n\n   It provides a framework while reporting
    on the study including:\n   theoretical background, results and basic considerations.
    \ It will\n   reference the detailed work being done on terminlogy and case studies\n
    \  documented in the research draft.  It also folds in discussions from\n   the
    research literature.  The documents, [HRPC-Research] and this\n   document, form
    an interrelated set that may later be combined into a\n   single document.\n\n
    \  This draft is still in very early stages and welcomes further\n   contribution.
    \ Text is solicited.\n\n   Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n   https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc\n\n\t
