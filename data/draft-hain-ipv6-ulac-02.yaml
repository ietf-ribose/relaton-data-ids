abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines Centrally Allocated IPv6 Unique Local address
    prefixes. These prefixes are globally unique and are intended for local communications,
    usually within a single network administration. They are not intended to be used
    in place of Provider Independent (PI) address prefixes available from the Regional
    Internet Registries (RIR) &lt;ref: http://www.iana.org/numbers/ &gt; , and should
    not appear in the global routing table for the Internet. The draft is being discussed
    on the ipv6@ietf.org list. Legal This documents and the information contained
    therein are provided on an "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION
