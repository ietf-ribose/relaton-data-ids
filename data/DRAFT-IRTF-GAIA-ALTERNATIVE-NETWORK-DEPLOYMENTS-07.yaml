abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a taxonomy of a set of \"Alternative
    Network\n   Deployments\" that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing\n
    \  Internet connectivity to people or for providing local communication\n   infrastructure
    to serve various complementary needs and objectives.\n   They employ architectures
    and topologies different from those of\n   mainstream networks, and rely on alternative
    governance and business\n   models.\n\n   The document also surveys the technologies
    deployed in these\n   networks, and their differing architectural characteristics,\n
    \  including a set of definitions and shared properties.\n\n   The classification
    considers models such as Community Networks,\n   Wireless Internet Service Providers
    (WISPs), networks owned by\n   individuals but leased out to network operators
    who use them as a\n   low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks
    that\n   provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users and\n
    \  rural utility cooperatives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
