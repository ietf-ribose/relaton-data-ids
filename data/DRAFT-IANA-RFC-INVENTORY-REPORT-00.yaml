abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This RFC archives the report on the ICANN/IANA \"RFC Inventory\"\n
    \  Project.  This project examined older RFCs for \"IANA Actions\", that\n   is,
    actions that need to be performed by ICANN/IANA as part of the\n   protocol parameters
    portion of the IANA Functions Contract, that were\n   not completed, not properly
    referenced or, in some other fashion,\n   required re-examination for incomplete
    IANA Actions.  The goal was to\n   ensure that, for all RFCs, the IANA Actions
    had been identified and\n   completed as accurately as possible.\n\n   In order
    to ensure that this report is available in a format that is\n   accessible to
    the IETF, this RFC is available in two formats: an\n   ASCII format which contains
    a summary of the graphics and charts\n   contained in the report to the IESG;
    and a PDF version which contains\n   all the graphics and charts in their original
    presentation.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
