abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management \nInformation
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in \nthe Internet Community.
    \ In particular, it defines objects used for \nthe management of Domain Name System
    (DNS) servers, and reserves an \nexperimental branch in the MIB-2 tree for DNS
    servers and resolvers. \nThis version (the '-00' draft) is the initial draft of
    an intended \nreplacement for RFC1611 which was changed to Historic status in
    \nOctober, 2001, and is intended to generate discussion and comment on \nthe desirability
    and usefulness of a DNS server MIB. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
