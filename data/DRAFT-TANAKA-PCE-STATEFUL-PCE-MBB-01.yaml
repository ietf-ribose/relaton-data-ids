abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding\n
    \  protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful
    control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSP).  Stateful
    PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state\n   and attributes (e.g., bandwidth
    and route) and also creating totally\n   new LSPs in the network.\n\n   In the
    current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often\n   controlled by \"make-before-break
    (M-B-B)\" signaling by headend for\n   the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.
    \ In most cases, it\n   is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without
    any data\n   disruption.\n\n   This document specifies the procedure of applying
    stateful PCE's\n   control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,\n
    \  two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined,\n   implicit
    mode and explicit mode.  This document also specifies the\n   usage and handling
    of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)\n   messages, expected behavior
    of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several\n   extensions of additional PCEP objects.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
