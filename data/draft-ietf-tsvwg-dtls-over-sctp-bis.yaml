abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP). It is an improved alternative to the existing rfc6083. DTLS over
    SCTP provides mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection, and
    replay protection for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol and
    allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to
    give communications privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering
    or message forgery. Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport
    features provided by SCTP and its extensions. This document is an improved alternative
    to RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation on protected user message size by
    defining a secure user message fragmentation so that multiple DTLS records can
    be used to protect a single user message. It further updates the DTLS versions
    to use, as well as the HMAC algorithms for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies secure implementation
    by some stricter requirements on the establishment procedures.</p>"
