abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale
    and\n   complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage\n
    \  and configure the network. Deploying policy or configuration based\n   on an
    abstract view of the underlying network is much better than\n   manipulating each
    individual network element, however, in this case,\n   the policy and configuration
    cannot be recognized by the network\n   devices. This document describes guidelines
    for mapping configuration\n   and policy into device-level configuration. The
    SUPA framework\n   overview and primary procedures of mapping are proposed. Moreover,
    an\n   exemplary mapping scenario is provided to illustrate the mechanism\n   involved.\n\n\t
