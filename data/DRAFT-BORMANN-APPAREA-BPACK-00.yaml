abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the\n
    \  representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values,\n   numbers,
    strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of\n   applications have started
    to look for binary representation formats\n   that solve a similar problem.  In
    particular, constrained node\n   networks can benefit from such a binary representation
    format.\n\n   A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable\n
    \  to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a slight modification of\n   MessagePack
    has been defined that allows for distinguishing UTF-8\n   strings from binary
    data.  This draft, as an independent effort,\n   documents the resulting BinaryPack
    format.\n\n   The current version -00 of this document is an early draft that
    is\n   intended to spark further discussion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
