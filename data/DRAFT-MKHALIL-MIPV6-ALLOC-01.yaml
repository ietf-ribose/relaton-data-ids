abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Static configuration of the MN's (Mobile Node) home address \nis
    a very cumbersome task and a provisioning nightmare for \nthe Service Providers.
    With millions of subscribers, a \ntypical Service Provider stands to incur considerable
    \nexpenses in order to manually configure all of its MN's \nhome address. \n\nThe
    ability to dynamically and securely allocate MN's \nhome address, therefore, can
    immensely aid in providing \na cost-effective and efficient device management
    \nalternative to the Service Providers. \n\nThis draft provides a simple method
    for dynamically \nallocating MN's home address in a secure manner.\n\t </p>\n
