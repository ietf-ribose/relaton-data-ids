abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network
    Management\n   Protocol (DTNMP).  The DTNMP provides monitoring and configuration\n
    \  services between managing devices and managed devices, some of which\n   may
    operate on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links.\n   The protocol
    is designed to minimize the number of transmitted bytes,\n   to operate without
    sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and to\n   function autonomously when
    there is no timely contact with a network\n   operator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
