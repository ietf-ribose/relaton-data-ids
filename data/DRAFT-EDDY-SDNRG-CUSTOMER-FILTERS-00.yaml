abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to reduce unwanted traffic and make efficient use
    of limited\n   access link capacity or other network resources, it is advantageous\n
    \  if customers can filter traffic destined to them, within their\n   upstream
    Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  The customer\n   receiving traffic
    should have control over inbound filters, since\n   their definition of desirable
    versus undesirable traffic may change\n   over time (e.g. as new network services
    and protocols are\n   introduced).  In this document, we describe an SDN-based
    means for\n   customers to express computable logic to their ISPs in order to\n
    \  distinguish between desirable and undesirable inbound traffic.  These\n   rules
    can be dynamically and securely updated within the running ISP\n   network, with
    full automation One use case for this is in mitigating\n   denial of service attacks.
    \ Even if such filtering is only\n   implemented in an ISP's access network, it
    preserves capacity on the\n   customer access links for desirable traffic.  If
    implemented at the\n   ISP's edge connections to other providers, or prior to
    ingress to\n   their core, it can also preserve the ISP's own network capacity
    and\n   other resources that may be threatened by attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
