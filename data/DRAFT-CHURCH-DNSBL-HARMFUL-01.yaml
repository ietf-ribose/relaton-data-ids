abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As spam continues to grow throughout the Internet, various\n
    \  countermeasures have been developed.  Among these is the \"DNS\n   blacklist\",
    a DNS server configured to return a \"good\" or \"bad\"\n   response to a query
    on a given IP address; mail servers can be\n   configured to automatically query
    such a server and reject messages\n   which are flagged \"bad\".  If the blacklist
    is accurate, this allows\n   mail servers to reject spam without wasting the time
    of the human\n   recipient or the resources of the server.  However, between delays\n
    \  in responding to environmental changes and arbitrary operational\n   decisions
    by blacklist operators, such blocking of mail in fact\n   causes significant harm
    to innocent third parties.  This memo\n   describes the issues concerning these
    blacklists and suggests ways\n   to resolve the attendant problems.\n\t </p>\n
