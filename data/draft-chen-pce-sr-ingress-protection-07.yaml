abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to Path Computation Element (PCE)
    communication Protocol (PCEP) for fast protecting the ingress nodes of two types
    of paths or tunnels, which are Segment Routing (SR) paths and Bit Index Explicit
    Replication Tree/Traffic Engineering (BIER-TE) paths. The extensions comprise
    a foundation for protecting the ingress nodes of different types of paths. Based
    on this, the ingress protection of a new type of paths can be easily supported.</p>"
