abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Several applications, such as peer-to-peer (P2P), contentdistribution
    and realtime services rely on selection mechanisms inorder to select the peer
    or server from which to request the service.Examples of such services are: file
    sharing, media streaming andvoice gateways.Application-layer selection algorithms
    do not typically take intoaccount network-layer topology information; either that
    informationis unavailable to them, or when such information is available (e.g.,from
    BGP Looking Glass servers), it does not include sufficientinformation about the
    local topology in the neighbourhood of theapplication client(s). Therefore, most
    applications today make theirselection decisions based on performance measurements
    (combined withsome amount of random selection) and largely ignore network layerrouting.
    It has been demonstrated that by keeping the traffic local(e.g., within the same
    Autonomous System) both infrastructureutilization and application performance
    may be improved.By enhancing selection algorithms through the use of accuratenetwork-layer
    topology, applications may improve performance whilenetwork operators are also
    able to reduce the utilization ofinfrastructure resources by application traffic.
    At the same time,exchange of information between the application and the networkshould
    not be allowed to compromise confidentiality for either party.Detailed routing
    information owned by the service provider should notbe made publicly available,
    while detailed information about theapplication should also not be made known
    to the service provider.This draft introduces a signaling protocol which we call
    \"PROXIDOR\".The PROXIDOR protocol is a request-response protocol in which aPROXIDOR
    Client (PxC) issues requests to and receives responses froma PROXIDOR Server (PxS).
    The questions of how a PxC discovers a PxSand how a PxS acquires network-layer
    topology information are beyondthe scope of this document.</p>"
