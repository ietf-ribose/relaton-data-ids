abstract:
- content: "<p>The TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol,
    by default, learns end station addresses from observing the data plane. This document
    specifies an optional message by which an originating TRILL switch can explicitly
    flush addresses learned by other TRILL switches through the egress of data ingress
    by that originating TRILL switch. This is a supplement to the TRILL automatic
    address forgetting and can assist in achieving more rapid convergence.</p>"
