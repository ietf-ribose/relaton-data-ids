abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TLS protocol supports different credentials, including
    pre-shared\n   keys, raw public keys, and X.509 certificates.  For use with public\n
    \  key cryptography developers have to decide between raw public keys,\n   which
    require out-of-band agreement and full-fletched X.509\n   certificates.  For devices
    where the reduction of code size is\n   important it is desirable to minimize
    the use of X.509-related\n   libraries.  With the CBOR Web Token (CWT) a structure
    has been\n   defined that allows CBOR-encoded claims to be protected with CBOR\n
    \  Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).\n\n   This document registers a new value
    to the \"TLS Certificate Types\"\n   sub-registry to allow TLS and DTLS to use
    CWTs.  Conceptually, CWTs\n   can be seen as a certificate format (when with public
    key\n   cryptography) or a Kerberos ticket (when used with symmetric key\n   cryptography).\n\n\t
