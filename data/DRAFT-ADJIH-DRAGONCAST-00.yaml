abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast\n
    \  protocol suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad\n   hoc
    networks (MANET).  It provides data dissemination from a single\n   source, based
    on intra-flow network coding and for Internet Protocol\n   (IP).  It is designed
    to minimize the assumptions over the working\n   environment and thus may operates
    over dynamically evolving\n   environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
