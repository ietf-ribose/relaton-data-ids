abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where
    network\n   nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   congestion
    to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will feed this\n   information back
    to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a\n   way that it can only feed
    back one congestion signal per Round-Trip\n   Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for
    other transport protocols, such as\n   RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more
    accurate ECN feedback.\n   Recent new TCP mechanisms (like ConEx or DCTCP) need
    more accurate\n   ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is received
    in\n   one RTT.  This document specifies requirements for an update to the\n   TCP
    protocol to provide more accurate ECN feedback.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
