abstract:
  content: "<p>In reference and response to draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01, this
    document describes a solution in the form of a protocol function named VPLS External
    Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM). VLPM is a protocol for a service provider to
    deploy at the PE to detect layer-2 loops in any external layer-2 segments (customer
    LAN) where customer deployed loop prevention methods may have failed. After detection
    of such a loop it facilitates configurable actions to protect the rest of the
    VPLS Domain from being affected without the need for inter-operation with customer
    network protocols, other VPLS PEs or sites.</p>"
