abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains recommendations of maximum tolerable delays
    to be added by methods which improve bandwidth utilization through compression,
    multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path. Recommendations are presented
    only for real-time network services for which such bandwidth optimization techniques
    are applicable (i.e., services with low payload size to header size ratio).</p>"
