abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a new CoAP response code, 2.__ Pending.
    \ A\n   CoAP server can use this response code to signal that it has accepted\n
    \  the request but has not yet started processing it or that processing\n   the
    request will take longer than a client is typically willing to\n   wait for a
    response.  A 2.__ response can include status information\n   and indicate a location
    where the result will become available.\n\nNote\n\n   The string \"2.__\" is a
    placeholder for the CoAP response code that\n   will be assigned by IANA on completion
    of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
