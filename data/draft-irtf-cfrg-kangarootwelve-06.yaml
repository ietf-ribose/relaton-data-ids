abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the KangarooTwelve eXtendable Output Function
    (XOF), a hash function with output of arbitrary length. It provides an efficient
    and secure hashing primitive, which is able to exploit the parallelism of the
    implementation in a scalable way. It uses tree hashing over a round-reduced version
    of SHAKE128 as underlying primitive. This document builds up on the definitions
    of the permutations and of the sponge construction in [FIPS 202], and is meant
    to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide.</p>"
