abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To allow traversal of firewalls or provide additional network\n
    \  services such as QoS or supplemental bandwidth, it is necessary to\n   deploy
    application-aware network elements.  Such network elements are\n   costly to create,
    deploy, and are unable to adequately cope with\n   changes to the application
    itself, stifling innovation.\n\n   This document describes a different approach,
    where the application\n   explicitly signals its needs to the network.\n\n\n\t
