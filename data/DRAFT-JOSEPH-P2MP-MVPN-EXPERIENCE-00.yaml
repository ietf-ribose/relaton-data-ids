abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multicast based VPNs have been deployed for a while now, based
    on the \n   Draft Rosen solution. In today's scenario, network deployments are
    moving \n   towards a choice Label Switched Multicast, primarily to garner some
    of the \n   advantages that a Label Switched Network can offer. In short, the
    \n   requirement is to achieve more optimal multicast replication and in other
    \n   words achieve better and effective bandwidth savings. This document describes
    \n   some of the experiences gained from the implementation and deployment of
    \n   Label Switched multicast using the RSVP-TE P2MP Label Switched Path approach,
    \n   and such is information only. The intent is to translate the experiences
    \n   gained into valuable practices for the Service Provider and Enterprise community
    \n   who intend to deploy this class of mVPNs. Information based on \"Hierarchical
    \n   Multicast Trees\" and \"Aggregated P Tunnels\" have not been included, and
    will \n   follow in the next version of this draft.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
