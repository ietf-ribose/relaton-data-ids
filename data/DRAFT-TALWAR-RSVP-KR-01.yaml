abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Killer Reservation Problem encountered\n
    \  when merging RSVP reservation requests.  These requests get merged as\n   they
    travel up the multicast distribution tree, losing information\n   about individual
    requests.  A request, which would have succeeded on\n   its own, may suffer denial
    of service when the 'merged request' fails\n   admission control.  This is the
    problem for which we present\n   different solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
