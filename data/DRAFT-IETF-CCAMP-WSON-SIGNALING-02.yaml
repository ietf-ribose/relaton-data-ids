abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched\n   optical
    networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs\n   under a number of
    conditions including: (a) when optional processing,\n   such as regeneration,
    must be configured to occur at specific nodes\n   along a path, (b) where equipment
    must be configured to accept an\n   optical signal with specific attributes, or
    (c) where equipment must\n   be configured to output an optical signal with specific
    attributes.\n   In addition this memo provides mechanisms to support distributed\n
    \  wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs, and choice in\n   distributed
    wavelength assignment algorithms. These extensions build\n   on previous work
    for the control of lambda and G.709 based networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
