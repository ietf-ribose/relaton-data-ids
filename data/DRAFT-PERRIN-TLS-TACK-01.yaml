abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines TACK, a TLS Extension that enables a
    TLS server\n   to assert the authenticity of its public key.  A \"tack\" contains
    a\n   \"TACK key\" which is used to sign the public key from the TLS server's\n
    \  certificate.  Hostnames can be \"pinned\" to a TACK key.  TLS\n   connections
    to a pinned hostname require the server to present a tack\n   containing the pinned
    key and a corresponding signature over the TLS\n   server's public key.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
