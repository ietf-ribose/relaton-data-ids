abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Ethernet based aggregation networks, several subscriber premises\nmay
    be logically connected to the same interface of an edge router.\nThis document
    proposes a method for the edge router to identify the\nsubscriber premises using
    the contents of the received Router\nSolicitation messages.  The applicability
    is limited to the N:1 VLAN\nallocation model.\n\t </p>\n      "
