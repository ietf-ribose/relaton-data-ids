abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the HTTP transport for the Open Trust\n
    \  Protocol (OTrP), which is used to manage code and configuration data\n   in
    a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  An implementation of this\n   document
    can run outside of any TEE, but interacts with an OTrP\n   implementation that
    runs inside a TEE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
