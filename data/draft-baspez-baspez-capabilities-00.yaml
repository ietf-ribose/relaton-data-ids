abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a model of Security Capabilities. Security Capabilities
    are intended to describe the potentiality that Network Security Functions (NSFs)
    have for security policy enforcement purposes. Therefore, Security Capabilities
    are represented as abstract functionalities that a NSF owns in terms of enforcement
    actions, conditions that can apply in order to determine to which packet or traffic
    enforce the actions, and other mechanisms that NSF use to determine the actions
    to enforce. The proposed capability model defines without ambiguities the operations
    a function can do in term of security policy enforcement.</p>"
