abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an explicit per-flow transport-layer
    signal for\n   hybrid measurement of end-to-end RTT.  This signal consists of
    three\n   bits: a spin bit, which oscillates once per end-to-end RTT, and a\n
    \  two-bit Valid Edge Counter (VEC), which compensates for loss and\n   reordering
    of the spin bit to increase fidelity of the signal in less\n   than ideal network
    conditions.  It describes the algorithm for\n   generating the signal, approaches
    for observing it to passively\n   measure end-to-end latency, and proposes methods
    for adding it to a\n   variety of IETF transport protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
