abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism\nframework
    that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols\nand attributes.  This
    framework has been extended with a media\ncapabilities negotiation mechanism that
    allows endpoints to negotiate\nadditional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation
    is embedded\ninto the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.\n\nThis memo extends
    the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow\nendpoints to negotiate two
    additional SDP capabilities.  In\nparticular, this memo provides a mechanism to
    negotiate titles (\"i=\"\nline for each session or media) and bandwidth (\"b=\"
    line).\n\t </p>\n      "
