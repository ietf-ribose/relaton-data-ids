abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of interval values that must be
    supported\n   for transmitting BFD control packets and for calculating the\n   detection
    time in the receive direction.  Implementations are allowed\n   to define a lower
    limit for the interval so that only set values\n   equal or larger than the lower
    limit needs to be supported.\n\n   This solves the problem of finding an interval
    value that both BFD\n   speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation
    as\n   seen for hardware-based BFD.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
