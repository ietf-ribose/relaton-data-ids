abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded
    in \n      separate headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and \n
    \     the upper-layer header in a packet.  There are a small number of \n      such
    extension headers, each identified by a distinct Next \n      Header value. However,
    it presents no backward compatible way \n      for incrementally introducing new
    IPv6 extension headers inside \n      the network.  \n\n      Additionally since
    there is no standard format for extension \n      headers, it becomes impossible
    for intermediaries that want to \n      deep inspect the packet to parse an incoming
    packet which \n      carries an extension header that it does not recognize. \n\n
    \     This document attempts to standardize the IPv6 extension header \n      format
    to fix these issues. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
