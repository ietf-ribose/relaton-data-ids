abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
    video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often
    run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in
    the applications, then network congestion will deteriorate the user's multimedia
    experience. This acts as a safety measure to prevent starvation of network resources
    denying other flows from access to the Internet, such measures are essential for
    an Internet that is heterogeneous and for traffic that is hard to predict in advance.
    This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm; instead, it defines
    a minimal set of RTP circuit- breakers. Circuit-breakers are conditions under
    which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data in order to protect
    the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of
    severe congestion, all RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will
    be able to run without triggering these circuit breakers. Any future RTP congestion
    control specification will be expected to operate within the constraints defined
    by these circuit breakers.</p>"
