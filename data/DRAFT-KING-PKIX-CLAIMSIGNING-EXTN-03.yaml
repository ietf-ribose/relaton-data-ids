abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an Extended Key Usage (EKU) value which\n
    \  indicates that the certificate holder is authorized to sign security\n   tokens
    to assert claims, or attributes, about a subject.\n\n   When a certificate that
    asserts the claimSigning EKU signs a claim,\n   the owner of the service holding
    that certificate is asserting that a\n   statement about the subject is true.
    For example, a IdP secure token\n   service (STS) would use an X.509 certificate
    containing the\n   claimSigning EKU to sign SAML assertions containing an identifier
    and\n   attributes about a user. This EKU value would allow for a separation\n
    \  between the designation that a given Identity belongs within a given\n   Federation,
    and the empowerment of that entity within the federation\n   to sign claims..
    \ This approach allows for greater flexibility for\n   the operators of Federated
    systems and for Certification Authorities\n   and avoids the overloading of other,
    already established methods\n   (such as Assurance Level designation via certificatePolicy
    OID).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
