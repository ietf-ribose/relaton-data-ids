abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing (SR)
    LSPs in networks running Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP-TE) LSPs. In some
    instances, operators are also migrating existing services from RSVP-TE to SR LSPs.
    For example, there might be certain services that are well suited for SR and need
    to co-exist with RSVP-TE in the same network. In other cases, services running
    on RSVP-TE might be migrated to run over SR. Such introduction or migration of
    traffic to SR might require co-existence with RSVP-TE in the same network for
    an extended period of time depending on the operator's intent. The following document
    provides solution options for keeping the traffic engineering database (TED) consistent
    across the network, accounting for the different bandwidth utilization between
    SR and RSVP-TE.</p>"
