abstract:
- content: "<p>This information document gives an example of early compression mechanism
    from the GPRS networks. It shows a utilization of the early compression enabler
    enhancements proposed for ROHC-TCP. It does not show an exhaustive use of all
    the options of the enabler, but rather shows a use of the basic enabler function.</p>"
