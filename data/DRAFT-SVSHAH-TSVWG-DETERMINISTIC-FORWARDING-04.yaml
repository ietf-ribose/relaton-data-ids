abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Differentiated Services Per-Hop-Behavior\n
    \  (PHB) Group called Deterministic Forwarding (DF).  The document\n   describes
    the purpose and semantics of this PHB.  It also describes\n   creation and forwarding
    treatment of the service class.  The document\n   also describes how the code-point
    can be mapped into one of the\n   aggregated Diffserv service classes [RFC5127].\n\n\t
