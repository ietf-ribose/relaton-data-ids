abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on
    the\n   capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet\n   loss.\n\n
    \  The common reasons for packet drop are Link Congestion, Device\n   (Router/Switch/Firewall/etc.)
    Performance, Software issues (bugs) on\n   a network device, Faulty Hardware or
    Cabling and Service Function\n   processing errors.\n\n   Packet Loss Measurement
    capability also provides operators with\n   greater visibility into the performance
    characteristics of their\n   networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting,
    and network\n   performance evaluation.\n\n   This document specifies best possible
    efficient and accurate\n   mechanism for passive packet loss measurement for Service
    Function\n   Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
