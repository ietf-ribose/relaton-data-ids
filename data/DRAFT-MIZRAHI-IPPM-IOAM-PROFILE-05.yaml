abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Situ Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) is
    used for\n   monitoring network performance and for detecting traffic bottlenecks\n
    \  and anomalies.  This is achieved by incorporating IOAM data into in-\n   flight
    data packets.  This document introduces the concept of use\n   case-driven IOAM
    profiles.  An IOAM profile defines a use case or a\n   set of use cases for IOAM,
    and an associated set of rules that\n   restrict the scope and features of the
    IOAM specification, thereby\n   limiting it to a subset of the full functionality.
    \ The motivation\n   for defining profiles is to limit the scope of IOAM features,\n
    \  allowing simpler implementation, verification, and interoperability\n   testing
    in the context of specific use cases that do not require the\n   full functionality
    of IOAM.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
