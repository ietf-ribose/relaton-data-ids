abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades,
    without\n   rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time,\n
    \  RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them\n   as
    managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document updates\n   the specifications
    to match established practice.  We do this by\n   naming data types defined in
    RFC 6158, which have been used since at\n   least RFC 2865.  We provide an IANA
    registry for the data types, and\n   update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry
    to include a \"data type\"\n   field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend
    that authors of\n   RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing\n
    \  practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
