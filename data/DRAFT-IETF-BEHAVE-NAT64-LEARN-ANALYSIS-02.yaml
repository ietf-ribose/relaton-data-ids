abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an
    IPv6\n   address is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the\n
    \  IPv4 network or Internet.  This document analyses a number of\n   proposed
    solutions for communicating whether the synthesis is taking\n   place, used address
    format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and\n   DNS64.  The solutions enable
    both NAT64 avoidance and intentional\n   utilization by allowing local IPv6 address
    synthesis.  The document\n   concludes by recommending selection of heuristic
    discovery based\n   solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
