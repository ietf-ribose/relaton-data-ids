abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write
    access\n   to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic\n
    \  primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes\n   among
    distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a\n   hierarchical trust
    delegation scheme maintained within an access\n   list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL
    access policy allows authorized peers to\n   write a Shared Resource without owning
    its corresponding certificate.\n   This specification also adds mechanisms to
    store Resources with a\n   variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent
    rendezvous\n   processes are required.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
