abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the
    last\n   decade has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate.  All\n
    \  most every new mobile device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based\n   wireless
    interface and with pre-configured policy to prefer Wi-Fi to\n   cellular access.
    \ Matching this evolution is every service provider's\n   desire to offer Wi-Fi
    based broadband services; a new business\n   opportunity even for fixed line operators.
    \ Operators are exploring\n   options to monetize their existing networks, most
    with nation-wide\n   footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi service that can be
    the basis\n   for offering new wireless broadband services.  This document\n   identifies
    the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community\n   services and the
    mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF\n   that can be used for enabling
    these architectures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
