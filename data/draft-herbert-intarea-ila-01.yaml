abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes identifier-locator addressing (ILA) for
    IPv6. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location and identity
    of a network node. Part of an address expresses the immutable identity of the
    node, and another part indicates the location of the node which can be dynamic.
    Identifier-locator addressing can be used to efficiently implement overlay networks
    for network virtualization as well as solutions for use cases in mobility.</p>"
