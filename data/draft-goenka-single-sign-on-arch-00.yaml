abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are several different single sign-on (SSO) solutions offeredby
    various software vendors today. All such solutions requireapplications to be written
    to a vendor specific API. In view of alack of industry wide standard for SSO APIs,
    applicationdevelopers find it almost impossible to SSO enable theirapplications
    to work with any vendor solution. This documentpresents alternative SSO implementation
    architecture that allowsapplications to be transparently enabled for SSO. Further,
    itallows different SSO solutions to interoperate with relativelylittle effort.</p>"
