abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The address space holder needs to issue an ROA object when
    it\n   authorizes one or more ASes to originate routes to multiple prefixes.\n
    \  During the process of ROA issuance, the address space holder needs to\n   specify
    an origin AS for a list of IP prefixes.  Besides, the address\n   space holder
    has a free choice to put multiple prefixes into a single\n   ROA or issue separate
    ROAs for each prefix based on the current\n   specification.  This memo analyzes
    and presents some operational\n   problems which may be caused by the misconfigurations
    of ROAs\n   containing multiple IP prefixes.  Some suggestions and considerations\n
    \  also have been proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
