abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mobility and multihoming extension to the
    IKEv2 protocol. The main purpose of this extension is to update the (outer) addresses
    associated with IKE and IPsec Security Associations. The extension also includes
    features that assist in selecting which addresses to use, and verify return routability
    during and after updates. It is also able to work together with NAT Traversal
    in some scenarios.</p>"
