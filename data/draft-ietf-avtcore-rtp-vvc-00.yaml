abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ITU-T Recommendation [H.266] and ISO/IEC International Standard [ISO23090-3],
    both also known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and developed by the Joint Video
    Experts Team (JVET). The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or
    more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well
    as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. The payload format has
    wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate
    entertainment-quality video, among other applications.</p>"
