abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol [MLSPROTO] document
    has\n   the role of defining a Group Key Agreement, all the necessary\n   cryptographic
    operations, and serialization/deserialization functions\n   necessary to create
    a scalable and secure group messaging protocol.\n   The MLS protocol is meant
    to protect against eavesdropping,\n   tampering, message forgery, and provide
    good properties such as\n   forward-secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security
    (PCS) in the case\n   of past or future device compromises.\n\n   This document,
    on the other hand is intended to describe a general\n   secure group messaging
    infrastructure and its security goals.  It\n   provides guidance on building a
    group messaging system and discusses\n   security and privacy tradeoffs offered
    by multiple security mechanism\n   that are part of the MLS protocol (ie. frequency
    of public encryption\n   key rotation).\n\n   The document also extends the guidance
    to parts of the infrastructure\n   that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol
    document and left to\n   the application or the infrastructure architects to design.\n\n
    \  While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to\n   follow
    in order to interoperate at the protocol level, most will\n   vastly influence
    the overall security guarantees that are achieved by\n   the overall messaging
    system.  This is especially true in case of\n   active adversaries that are able
    to compromise clients, the delivery\n   service or the authentication service.\n\n\t
