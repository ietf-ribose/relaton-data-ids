abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how to provide IPsec-based flow protection\n
    \  (integrity and confidentiality) by means of an Interface to Network\n   Security
    Function (I2NSF) controller.  It considers two main well-\n   known scenarios
    in IPsec: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-\n   host.  The service described
    in this document allows the\n   configuration and monitoring of IPsec Security
    Associations (IPsec\n   SAs) from a I2NSF Controller to one or several flow-based
    Network\n   Security Functions (NSFs) that rely on IPsec to protect data traffic.\n\n
    \  The document focuses on the I2NSF NSF-facing Interface by providing\n   YANG
    data models for configuring the IPsec databases, namely Security\n   Policy Database
    (SPD), Security Association Database (SAD), Peer\n   Authorization Database (PAD),
    and IKEv2.  This allows IPsec SA\n   establishment with minimal intervention by
    the network administrator.\n   It defines three YANG modules but it does not define
    any new\n   protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
