abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A drawback with many NAT UDP hole punching techniques is thekeepalive
    traffic necessary to keep the UDP binding open. It itnecessary to send keepalives
    frequently because it is not possible todetermine or modify the NAT's binding
    lifetime. This keepalivetraffic causes server load and additional network traffic,
    which isespecially problematic with battery-operated wireless devices.This document
    describes two mechanisms to discover NATs and firewallsand a mechanism to query
    and control their binding lifetime. Withthese mechanisms, UDP binding discovery
    and UDP keepalive traffic canbe reduced to involve only the necessary NATs or
    firewalls. Thiseliminates the keepalive traffic to servers, and vastly reduceskeepalive
    traffic across the network. At the same time, backwardscompatibility with NATs
    and firewalls that do not support thisspecification is retained, which allows
    for incremental deployment ofthis mechanism.This document is discussed on the
    SAFE mailing list,&lt;http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/safe&gt;.</p>"
