abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes the architecture and solution options for
    \nmulticast receiver mobility.  The discussions are restricted only to \nthe receiver
    mobility with the assumption that the multicast source \nand network are stationary
    while the receiver is in the moving state.  \nThe suggestions are given on how
    to integrate mobile IP and fixed \nmulticast protocols to provide the feasible
    solutions, which \ninvolves the aspects of mobile receiver registration, group
    \nmembership management, tunnel or optimal multicast routing, and \nhandover optimization.
    \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
