abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes a data-plane in-band active measurement
    method\n   for SRv6.  A packet containing an SRH uses a flag bit to indicate it\n
    \  is an active probing packet.  The measurement information, such as\n   the
    IOAM header and data, is encapsulated in UDP payload.  The\n   probing packet
    originates from a segment source node and terminates\n   at a configured segment
    endpoint node.  Each segment node on the\n   path, when detecting the flag, parses
    the UDP header and the payload.\n   In case of IOAM, the node adds data to the
    IOAM node data fields.\n   The method avoids the performance and encapsulation
    issues for\n   applying IOAM as well as other measurement techniques in SRv6\n
    \  networks.  Multiple applications can be supported by the method.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
