abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance\n
    \  requirement of different services or customers in a shared network.\n   An
    IETF network slice may span multiple network domains.  In the\n   context of 5G,
    the 5G end-to-end network slices consist of three\n   major types of network segments:
    Radio Access Network (RAN),\n   Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN).\n\n
    \  In order to facilitate the mapping between network slices in\n   different
    network segments and network domains, it is beneficial to\n   carry the identifiers
    of the 5G end-to-end network slice, the multi-\n   domain IETF network slice together
    with the intra-domain network\n   slice identifier in the data packet.\n\n   This
    document defines the mechanism of encapsulating the end-to-end\n   network slice
    related information in IPv6 data plane.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
