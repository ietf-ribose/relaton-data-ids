abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation through
    class-based forwarding. IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) and LDP have already been
    extended to setup MTR. In order to deploy mLDP in an MTR network, mLDP is also
    required to become topology-aware. This document specifies extensions to mLDP
    to support Multi-Topology Routing.</p>"
