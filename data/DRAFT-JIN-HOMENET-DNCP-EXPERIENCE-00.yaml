abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP) is a generic
    state\n   synchronization protocol that offers data synchronization and dynamic\n
    \  network topology discovery within a network.  This document reports\n   experience
    with the DNCP, which includes its implementation status\n   and performance evaluation
    in a simulated environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
