abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA
    (SMC-R) protocol. This protocol provides RDMA communications to TCP endpoints
    in a manner that is transparent to socket applications. It further provides for
    dynamic discovery of partner RDMA capabilities and dynamic setup of RDMA connections,
    transparent high availability and load balancing when redundant RDMA network paths
    are available, and it maintains many of the traditional TCP/IP qualities of service
    such as filtering that enterprise users demand, as well as TCP socket semantics
    such as urgent data.</p>"
