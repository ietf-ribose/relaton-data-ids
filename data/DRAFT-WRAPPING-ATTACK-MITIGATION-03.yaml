abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   XML signature standard as described in [RFC3275] and defined
    by IETF/\n   W3C references or identifies signed elements by their unique\n   identities
    in the given XML document.  Hence, signed XML elements can\n   be shifted from
    one location to another location in a XML\n   document,and still, it does not
    have any effect on its ability to\n   verify its signature.  This flexibility
    paves the way for an attacker\n   to tweak original XML message without getting
    noticed by the\n   receiver.  This document proposes to use absolute XPath as
    an\n   \"Positional Token\" and modifies existing XML Digital Signature\n   algorithm
    to overcome the XML Signature wrapping/rewriting attacks on\n   XML ignatures.\n\n\t
