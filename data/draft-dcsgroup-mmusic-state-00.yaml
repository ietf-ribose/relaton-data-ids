abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes extensions to the Session InitiationProtocol
    RFC(2543) for supporting telephony services using theDistributed Call Signaling
    architecture described in [2]. Thisdocument discusses extensions to the host parameter
    in the SIP URLfor supporting the following: (a) a call signaling architecturewhere
    call state is distributed to the clients during call setup andstored there for
    the duration of the call, (b) support for localnumber portability and (c) relaxation
    of the strong coupling betweenthe phone number and its gateway in the telephony
    subscriber URL asdefined in RFC 2543. Additional headers in SIP messages for passingcall
    state information between the clients and their proxies, andsupport for PSTN-based
    operator services are also discussed in thisdocument. In addition, the need for
    the Also and Replaces headerspreviously discussed in [3]) are mentioned here.</p>"
