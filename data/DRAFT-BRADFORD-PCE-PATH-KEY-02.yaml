abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)
    \n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation \n   Elements
    (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such \n   as Autonomous Systems
    (ASs), the path may be computed by multiple \n   PCEs that cooperate, with each
    responsible for computing a segment \n   of the path. However, in some cases (e.g.
    when ASs are \n   administered by separate Service Providers), it would break
    \n   confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE \n   in
    another domain, thus disclosing internal topology information. \n   This issue
    may be circumvented by returning a loose hop and by \n   invoking a new path computation
    from the domain boundary LSR \n   during TE LSP setup as the LSP enters the second
    domain, but this \n   technique has several issues including the problem of maintaining
    \n   path diversity. \n    \n   This document defines a mechanism to hide the
    contents of a \n   segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).
    The \n   CPS may be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE \n
    \  Communication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource \n   Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) explicit route object.\n\t </p>\n      "
