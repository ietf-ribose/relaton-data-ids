abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a backward compatible optimization for
    the\nDatabase Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  In this\noptimization, a
    router does not list an LSA in Database Description\npackets sent to a neighbor,
    if the same or a more recent instance of\nthe LSA was listed in a Database Description
    packet already received\nfrom the neighbor.  This optimization reduces Database
    Description\noverhead by about 50% in large networks.  This optimization does
    not\naffect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information\nfrom
    Database Description packets.\n\t </p>\n      "
