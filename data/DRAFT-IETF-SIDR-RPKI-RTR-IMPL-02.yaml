abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an implementation report for the RPKI Router\n
    \  protocol as defined in [RFC6810].  The editor did not verify the\n   accuracy
    of the information provided by respondents or by any\n   alternative means.  The
    respondents are experts with the\n   implementations they reported on, and their
    responses are considered\n   authoritative for the implementations for which their
    responses\n   represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if
    the\n   feature had at least been tested in the lab.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
