abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
    defined in RFC 5575 for the dissemination of BGP flow specifications. RFC 5575
    requires that the originator of the flow specification matches the originator
    of the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in the flow
    specification. This allows only BGP speakers within the data forwarding path (such
    as autonomous system border routers) to originate BGP flow specifications. Though
    it is possible to disseminate such flow specifications directly from border routers,
    it may be operationally cumbersome in an autonomous system with a large number
    of border routers having complex BGP policies. The modification proposed herein
    enables flow specifications to be originated from a centralized BGP route controller.</p>"
