- content: "<p>In view of the unpredictable and problematic nature of wireless networks,
    arriving at an optimized wireless transport is a daunting task. We have reviewed
    the existing proposals along with future research items. Based on this overview,
    we also recommend mechanisms for implementation in long thin networks.</p>"
