abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of Constrained RESTful Environments\n
    \  (CoRE) Link Format Interface Descriptions [RFC6690] applicable for\n   use
    in constrained environments.  These include the: Actuator,\n   Paramter, Read-only
    parameter, Sensor, Batch, Linked Batch and Link\n   List interfaces.\n\n   The
    Batch, Linked Batch and Link List interfaces make use of resource\n   collections.
    \ This document further describes how collections relate\n   to interfaces.\n\n
    \  Many applications require a set of interface descriptions in order\n   provide
    the required functionality.  This document defines the\n   concept of function
    sets to specify this set of interfaces and\n   resources.\n\n   _Editor's note:
    The git repository for the draft is found at\n   https://github.com/core-wg/interfaces_\n\n
    \  _Editor's note: Two open issues are proposals for: Removing the\n   binding
    interface in favour of the link list interface.  Changing\n   \"rel\" type from
    one attribute to two to indicate src and\n   destination._\n\n\t </p>\n      "
