abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed solutions that promote a healthy IPv4 and IPv6
    co-existence. The happy eyeballs algorithm for instance, provides recommendations
    to application developers to help prevent bad user experience in situations where
    IPv6 connectivity is broken. This document describes a metric used to measure
    the effectiveness of the happy eyeballs algorithm. The insights uncovered by analysing
    the data from multiple locations is discussed.</p>"
