abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to add new\n
    \  RECOMMENDED attributes to be used in the protocol to provide\n   information
    about the data reduction properties of files. The new\n   data reduction attributes
    are proposed to allow the client\n   application to communicate to the NFSv4 server
    data reduction\n   attributes associated with files and directories using new
    metadata,\n   communicated to the Block Storage data reduction engines.\n   Corresponding
    new RECOMMENDED attributes are proposed to allow\n   clients and client applications
    to query the server for data\n   reduction attributes support and allow to get
    and set data reduction\n   attributes on files and directories. Such data reduction\n
    \  metadata is used as hints to the file server about what type of data\n   reduction
    to apply. The proposed data reduction attributes include\n   achievable ratios
    for compression and deduplication plus whether\n   each data reduction technique
    applies to a file or directory.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
