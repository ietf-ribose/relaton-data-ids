abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in
    multimedia\n   conferences that enables a Media Distribution Device (MDD) to\n
    \  facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the\n   Key
    Management Function (KMF) responsible for key distribution.  The\n   protocol
    is designed to ensure that key material used for end-to-end\n   encryption and
    authentication is inaccessible to the MDD, while key\n   material used for hop-by-hop
    encryption and authentication is\n   accessible to the MDD.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
