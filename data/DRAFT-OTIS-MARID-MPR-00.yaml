abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For domains sending or receiving mail, there is often a desire
    to\n   publish policies indicating types of mail sent or accepted, and to\n   specify
    the collateral Mail Channel to assist in these policies.  The\n   challenge is
    to allow the recipient a deterministic means for\n   obtaining this information,
    while not creating additional burdens for\n   normal mail use.\n\t </p>\n      "
