abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The generation of BGP adj-rib-in, local-rib or adj-rib-out
    comes from\n   BGP route exchange and route policy processing.  BGP Monitoring\n
    \  Protocol (BMP) provides the monitoring of BGP adj-rib-in [RFC7854],\n   BGP
    local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib] and BGP adj-rib-out\n   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out].
    \ By monitoring these BGP RIB's the\n   full state of the network is visible,
    but how route-policies affect\n   the route propagation or changes BGP attributes
    is still not.  This\n   document describes a method of using BMP to record the
    trace data on\n   how BGP routes are (not) changed under the process of route
    policies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
