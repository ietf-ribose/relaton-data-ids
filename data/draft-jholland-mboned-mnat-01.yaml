abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for a network to maintain Network Address
    Translation address mappings for the transport of globally addressed multicast
    traffic within a network that can't otherwise forward the globally addressed traffic.
    A new Multicast Network Address Translation (MNAT) service is defined to communicate
    the address mappings to ingress and egress points within the network, and considerations
    for operation of the MNAT service are described.</p>"
