abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
    view of the provider network topology containing the points from which its services
    can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN, network slices). The data model
    augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding the concept of service attachment
    points (SAPs). The service attachment points are the points to which network services
    (such as L3VPN or L2VPN) can be attached. The customer endpoint of an attachment
    circuits are not covered in the SAP network topology.</p>"
