abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
    furthers the development and specification of Internet technology through the
    general discussion of topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exists. As this
    is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed. Advertising,
    whether to solicit business or promote employment opportunities, falls well outside
    the range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal nature. This document
    obsoletes RFC3005.</p>"
