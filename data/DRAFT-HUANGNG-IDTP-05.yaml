abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       The Identifier Tracing Protocol (IDTP) is an application-level\n
    \      protocol for distributed and collaborative information systems. It\n       is
    a generic communication protocol which can be used for many tasks\n       with
    two types of forwarding mechanisms to achieve traceability by\n       using Universal
    Traceable Identifier (UTID) [I-D-UTID] which\n       contains two types of forwarding
    messages.\n\n       This document provides the specification of IDTP, including
    syntax,\n       data format, and the guidelines for their use, too.\n\n\t </p>\n
