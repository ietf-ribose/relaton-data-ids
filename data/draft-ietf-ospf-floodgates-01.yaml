abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specificationwhich
    allows the partial suppression of flooding between neighboringrouters. This suppression
    acts much like a floodgate, opening andclosing automatically when triggered by
    the proper conditions. Twotypes of flooding suppression are described, 1-Way and
    2-Way. Theoption applies to standard areas, stub areas, and NSSAs. It worksover
    any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured arebackward compatible
    with routers running an OSPFv2 compliantimplementation as defined in RFC 2328,
    and can be restricted to asubset of the OSPF routing domain. This option is applied
    onlybetween neighboring OSPF routers.</p>"
