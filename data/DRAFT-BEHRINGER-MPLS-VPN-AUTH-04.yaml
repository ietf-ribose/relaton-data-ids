abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Configuration errors on Provider Edge (PE) routers in Layer-3
    VPN \nnetworks based on [RFC2547] can lead to security breaches of the \nconnected
    VPNs. For example, the PE router could be mistakenly \nconfigured such that a
    connected Customer Edge (CE) router belongs to \nan incorrect VPN. Here we propose
    a scheme that verifies local and \nremote routing information received by the
    PE router before it \ninstalls new VPN routes into the Virtual Routing &amp; Forwarding
    \nInstance (VRF). The proposed changes affect only the PE routers.\n\t </p>\n
