abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The security provided by authenticated TLS connection between\n
    \  clients and servers should protect both parties from \"Man-in-\n   the-Middle\"
    (MITM) attacks.  Clients should be authenticating\n   that the server they are
    connected to is the server they\n   requested, and servers that act as client
    agents need to\n   authenticate that the connection is directly to their client.\n\n
    \  An extension to the Domain Name System (DNS), The DNS-Based\n   Authentication
    of Named Entities (DANE) (RFC 6698), allows TLS\n   servers to publish their public
    certificates for use by TLS\n   clients to authenticate the server connection.\n\n\t
