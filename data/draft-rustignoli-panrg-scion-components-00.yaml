abstract:
- content: "<p>SCION is a future Internet architecture that focuses on security and
    availability. Its fundamental functions are carried out by a number of components.
    This document illustrates the dependencies between its core components and extensions.
    It also discusses the relationship between SCION and existing protocols, with
    focus on illustrating which existing protocols are reused or extended. Additionally,
    it describes the motivations behind cases where a greenfield approach is needed,
    and the properties that can be achieved thanks to it. It then briefly touches
    on the maturity level of components.</p>"
