abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over
    \n   wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the \n   characteristics
    of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make \n   forwarding decisions. In
    mobile or other environments where these \n   characteristics change frequently,
    manual configurations or the  \n   inference of state through routing or transport
    protocols does not \n   allow the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional,
    event-\n   driven communication channel between the router and the modem is \n
    \  necessary.\n\t </p>\n      "
