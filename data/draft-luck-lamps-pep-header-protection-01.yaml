abstract:
- content: "<p>Issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been recently raised
    in the IETF LAMPS Working Group. The need for amendments to the existing specification
    regarding header protection was expressed. The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) implementations
    currently use a mechanism quite similar to the currently standardized message
    wrapping for S/MIME. The main difference is that pEp is using PGP/ MIME instead,
    and adds space for carrying public keys next to the protected message. In LAMPS
    voices have also been expressed, that whatever mechanism will be chosen, it should
    not be limited to S/MIME, but also applicable to PGP/MIME. This document aims
    to contribute to this discussion and share pEp implementation experience with
    email header protection.</p>"
