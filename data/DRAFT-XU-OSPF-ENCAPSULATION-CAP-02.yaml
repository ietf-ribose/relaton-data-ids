abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons.  A large
    variety\n   of tunnel types are defined and the ingress needs to select a type
    of\n   tunnel which is supported by the egress.  This document defines how\n   to
    advertise egress tunnel capabilities in OSPF Router Information.\n\n\t </p>\n
