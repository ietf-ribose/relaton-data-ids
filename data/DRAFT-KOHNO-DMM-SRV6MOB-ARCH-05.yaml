abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SRv6 mobile user plane is standardized in IETF.  It accomplishes
    the\n   mobile user-plane functions in a simple, flexible and scalable\n   manner,
    by utilizing the network programming nature of SRv6.  It\n   leverages common
    native IPv6 data plane and creates interoperable\n   overlays with underlay optimization.\n\n
    \  This document discusses the solution approach and its architectural\n   benefits
    of common data plane across domains and across overlay/\n   underlay.\n\n\t </p>\n
