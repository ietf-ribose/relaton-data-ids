abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture
    that\nis applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks and\nspecifies
    protocols for implementing it.  This tunneling architecture\nis designed to facilitate
    scalability and reliability.  A prominent\nfeature of it is to provide VPN tunnels
    over a connectionless\nnetwork.  Since a connectionless network can provide full
    mesh\nconnectivity without a connection establishment procedure, the\narchitecture
    enables scalable operation of a VPN more efficiently\nthan connection-oriented
    tunneling technologies.\n\t </p>\n      "
