abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium. The wireless medium
    presents significant challenges to achieve deterministic properties such as low
    packet error rate, bounded consecutive losses, and bounded latency. This document
    defines the RAW Architecture following an OODA loop that involves OAM, PCE, PSE
    and PAREO functions. It builds on the DetNet Architecture and discusses specific
    challenges and technology considerations needed to deliver DetNet service utilizing
    scheduled wireless segments and other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical
    media resources with stochastic traffic.</p>"
