abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document argues for more inclusive language conventions\n
    \  sometimes used by RFC authors and the RFC Production Centre in\n   Internet-Drafts
    that are work in progress, and in new RFCs that may\n   be published in any of
    the RFC series, in order to foster greater\n   knowledge transfer and improve
    diversity of participation in the\n   IETF.\n\n   This document represents the
    opinion of the authors and does not have\n   IETF consensus.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
