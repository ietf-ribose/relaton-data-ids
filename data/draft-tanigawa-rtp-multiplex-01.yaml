abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a simple voice stream multiplexing method
    which isdesigned to reduce the IP-UDP header overhead of RTP (real-time transportprotocol)
    streams and to decrease the number of packets in the end-to-endtransport functions.
    The proposed multiplexing method is to concatenateRTP packets destined for the
    same Internet Telephony Gateway (IP-GW) intoa single UDP packet. The benefits
    of this method are that no newadditional headers are required and the current
    well-defined H.323 andRTP standards can be used. Furthermore, this method is a
    general RTP packet multiplexing method thatis applicable not only to an IP-GW
    but also to other multiplexingapplications, as well as trunking VoIP streams application
    with insertionand deletion of RTP streams on the way.</p>"
