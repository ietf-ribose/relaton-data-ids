abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\n
    \  encryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\n   standpoint
    as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\n   message delivery is prioritized
    over security.  This document\n   describes a complementary SMTP service extension,
    REQUIRETLS.  If the\n   REQUIRETLS option is used when sending a message, it causes
    message\n   delivery to fail if a TLS connection with the required security\n
    \  characteristics cannot be completed with the next hop MTA or if that\n   MTA
    does not also advertise that it supports REQUIRETLS.  Message\n   originators
    may therefore expect transport security to be used for\n   messages sent with
    this option.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
