abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities,
    and\n   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When\n   establishing
    interactive communication \"calls\" there needs to be a\n   way to communicate
    and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's\n   language needs, abilities,
    and preferences with the capabilities of\n   the called party.  This is especially
    important with emergency\n   calling, where a call can be routed to a PSAP or
    call taker capable\n   of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay
    operator can\n   be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-\n
    \  emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling an airline\n   reservation
    desk).\n\n   This document describes the need and expected use, and discusses
    the\n   solution using either an existing or new SDP attribute.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
