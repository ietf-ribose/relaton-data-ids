abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a unified mode of operation for Virtual\n
    \  Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control\n   channel
    that is associated with a pseudowire (PW).  VCCV applies to\n   all supported
    access circuit and transport types currently defined\n   for PWs, as well as those
    being transported by the MPLS Transport\n   Profile.  This new mode is intended
    to augment those described in\n   RFC5085.  It describes new rules requiring this
    mode to be used as\n   the default/mandatory mode of operation for VCCV.  The
    older VCCV\n   types will remain optional.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
