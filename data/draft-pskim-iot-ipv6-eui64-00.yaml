abstract:
- content: "<p>An IoT-specific IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is suggested
    for diverse types of IoT devices. Both domain type and device type are defined
    and combined with 16-bit hexadecimal number, which is called the IoT type identifier.
    Then, this IoT type identifier is reflected in generating EUI-64 for each IoT
    device. An IoT-specific IPv6 address is developed using the stateless address
    autoconfiguration with the network prefix and the modified EUI-64.</p>"
