abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are multiple environments where IPv6 transition techniques
    can\nbe used.  There are multiple IPv6 transition techniques.  This\ndocument
    describes the applicability of transition techniques based\non the Tunnel Setup
    Protocol(TSP) used in different environments,\nsuch as: provider, enterprise,
    unmanaged networks, cable-dsl\noperators, wireless operators, mobile hosts and
    networks.  TSP\nenables the automation of prefix assignment, DNS delegation and\nrouting
    preferences.  TSP supports IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv6\nencapsulations,
    as well as UDP-IPv4 encapsulation for IPv4 NAT\ntraversals, through automatic
    NAT discovery.\n\t </p>\n      "
