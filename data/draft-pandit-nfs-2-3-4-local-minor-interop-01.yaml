abstract:
- content: "<p>NFS (Network File System) version 4 is a major rewrite of NFS. NFS
    version 4 has lot of new features added into the protocol and the behavior is
    changed a lot from the predecessors. This Draft considers the interoperability
    problems of all versions of NFS and local filesystem. Yet, access to any one file
    system through the NFS v2 or NFS v3 or NFS v4 protocol requires that a single
    server be accessed. This draft tries to suggest the behavior that could be expected
    when NFS version 4 is used in multi-protocol environment with NFS version 2 and
    version 3.</p>"
