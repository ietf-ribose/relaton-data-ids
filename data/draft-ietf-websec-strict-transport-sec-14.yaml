abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a mechanism enabling web sites to declare
    themselves accessible only via secure connections and/or for users to be able
    to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections.
    This overall policy is referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). The
    policy is declared by web sites via the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response
    header field and/or by other means, such as user agent configuration, for example.
