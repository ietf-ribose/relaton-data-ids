abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires
    that the\n   original data does not change during serialization or parsing.  By\n
    \  applying the rules defined by the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS),\n   data
    provided in JSON [RFC8259] format can be exchanged \"as is\",\n   while still
    being usable by secure cryptographic operations.  JCS\n   achieves this by building
    on the strict serialization formats for\n   JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript
    [ES6], constraining JSON data\n   to the I-JSON [RFC7493] subset, and through
    a platform independent\n   property sorting scheme.\n\n   The intended audiences
    of this document are JSON tool vendors, as\n   well as designers of JSON based
    cryptographic solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
