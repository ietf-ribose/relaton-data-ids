abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a profile for the structure of repositories that
    contain X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed
    objects. This profile contains the proposed object naming scheme, the contents
    of repository publication points, the contents of publication point manifests
    and a possible internal structure of a Repository Cache that is intended to facilitate
    synchronization across a distributed collection of repositories and facilitate
    certificate path construction.</p>"
