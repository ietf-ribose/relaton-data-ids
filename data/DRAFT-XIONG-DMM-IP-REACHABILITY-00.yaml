abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile
    node\n   (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address\n
    \  to communicate with different hosts.\n\n   When a new correspondent node (CN)
    initials an IP session with MN,\n   the CN needs to find and select one of the
    MN's IP addresses to best\n   (e.g. with low delay) for the IP session..\n\n   This
    draft provides two solutions to find and select of MN's IP\n   addresses, one
    is DDNS[rfc 2136]-based solution, the other is Server\n   Register-based solution.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
