abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets from
    congestion. Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routers with extension
    of this memo than by group member end-hosts. Because necessary interactions are
    limited among adjacent routers, this scheme substantially reduces overall signaling
    overhead among group members for packet recovery.</p>"
