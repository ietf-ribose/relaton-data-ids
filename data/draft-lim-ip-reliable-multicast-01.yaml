abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets fromcongestion.
    Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routerswith extension of this
    memo than by group member end-hosts. Becausenecessary interactions are limited
    among adjacent routers, this schemesubstantially reduces overall signaling overhead
    among group membersfor packet recovery.</p>"
