abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,\nPE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,...,
    CEm.  If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the
    core, it is desirable for a core  router \"P\"\ncarrying traffic to the failed
    edge router PEi to immediately restore\ntraffic by re-tunneling packets originally
    tunneled to PEi and\ndestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers
    that\nadvertised P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is\nhighly
    desirable to keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions on external
    connectivity. Thus (1) a core router should\nnot be required to learn any BGP
    prefix, (2) the size of the\nforwarding and routing tables in the core routers
    should be\nindependent of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should be no\nspecial
    router (or group of routers) that handles restoring traffic\nor the need for one
    router to store the forwarding table of another\nrouter, (4) re-routing traffic
    without waiting for re-convergence\nmust not cause loops, and (4) there should
    be no restrictions on what\nedge routers advertise what prefixes. For labeled
    prefixes, (6) the\nrepairing core router must swap the label stack advertised
    by the\nfailed edge router PEi for the prefix P/m with the label stack\nadvertised
    for the same prefix by the edge router PEj before re-\ntunneling the packet to
    PEj\n\n\t </p>\n      "
