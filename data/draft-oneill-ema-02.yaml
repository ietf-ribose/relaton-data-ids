abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft outlines a system for domain-based routing andaddressing
    support in handling edge mobility such as encountered incellular systems and Internet
    roaming. The system includes novelfeatures for IP session, address and localised
    host redirect routemanagement which promise significant scaling benefits compared
    toother micro-mobility solutions. In addition, the system is closelyintegrated
    with the Mobile IP architecture for both signalling anddata forwarding, so that
    a rich set of capabilities and InternetServices are possible, and incremental
    deployment of EMA is possiblewithin and between AS's. The draft also suggests
    a specific protocolbased on TORA for the implementation of such an architecture.
    Itadvocates the creation of a specific IETF working group to addressan overall
    architecture for edge mobility routing, specificextensions to existing routing
    protocols to accomplish thatarchitecture, and extensions to existing Internet
    technologies suchas Mobile IP to support this architecture.</p>"
