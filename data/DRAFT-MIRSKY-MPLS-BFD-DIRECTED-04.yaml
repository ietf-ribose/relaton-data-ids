abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor
    bi-\n   directional paths.  When a BFD session monitors in its forward\n   direction
    an explicitly routed path there is a need to be able to\n   direct egress BFD
    peer to use specific path as reverse direction of\n   the BFD session.\n\n\t </p>\n
