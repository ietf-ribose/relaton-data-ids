abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>While conventional wisdom has it that Wireless Access Points are\nstrictly
    Layer 2 bridges, such devices today perform some higher\nlayer functions of routers
    or switches in wired Infrastructure in\naddition to bridging the wired and wireless
    networks.  For example,\nin 802.11 networks,  Access Points can function as Network
    Access\nServers.  For this reason, Access Points have IP addresses and can\nfunction
    as IP devices.\n\t </p>\n      "
