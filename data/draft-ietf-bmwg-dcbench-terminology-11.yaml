abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions
    and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as it
    is to introduce new terminologies applicable to data center performance evaluations.
    The purpose of this document is not to define the test methodology, but rather
    establish the important concepts for benchmarking network switches and routers
    in the data center. The terminologies are not only data center specific and can
    be seen as updates to [RFC1242], [RFC2432], [RFC2544], [RFC2889] and [RFC3918],
    without the intent to cover the all use cases outside of data center.</p>"
