abstract:
  content: "<p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitionsand
    describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, aswell as it is
    to introduce new terminologies applicable to data centerperformance evaluations.
    The purpose of this document is not to definethe test methodology, but rather
    establish the important concepts forbenchmarking network switches and routers
    in the data center. Theterminologies are not only data center specific and can
    be seen asupdates to [RFC1242], [RFC2432], [RFC2544], [RFC2889] and [RFC3918],without
    the intent to cover the all use cases outside of data center.</p>"
