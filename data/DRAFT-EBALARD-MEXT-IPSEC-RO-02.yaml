abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo specifies an improved alternate route optimization\nprocedure
    for Mobile IPv6 designed specifically for environments\nwhere IPsec is used between
    peers (most probably with IKE).  The\nreplacement of the complex Return Routability
    procedure for a simple\nmechanism and the removal of HAO and RH2 extensions from
    exchanged\npackets result in performance and security improvements.\n\t </p>\n
