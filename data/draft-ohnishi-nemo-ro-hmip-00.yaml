abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In a nested mobile network situation, the packet transfer routebetween
    a correspondent node(CN) and a mobile node(MN) may becomemuch longer than in the
    simple Mobile IP case, because packets canreach endpoints through all of the home
    agents (HAs) to which themobile routers (MRs) and the MN belong. The existing
    routeoptimization function of Mobile IPv6 cannot solve this problem,because while
    it can bypass an MN's HA, it cannot skip the MRs' HAs.Furthermore, there is no
    route optimization method for communicationnodes without Mobile IPv6 functionality,
    which are the so-calledlocal fixed nodes (LFNs) within a mobile network. This
    draft providessolutions to achieve route optimization in these situations by usingHMIP
    technology and proxy Mobile IP functions.</p>"
