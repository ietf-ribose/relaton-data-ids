abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes Fast Route Attestation (FRA), a mechanism
    for\n   securing AS paths and preventing prefix hijacking by signing and\n   verifying
    critical AS path segments (i.e., adjacent AS triples along\n   AS path).  When
    full-deployed, FRA can achieve similar level of\n   security as BGPSec, but with
    much higher efficiency.  When partial-\n   deployed, FRA offers more security
    benefits than BGPSec.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
