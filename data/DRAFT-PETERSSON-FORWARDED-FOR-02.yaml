abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that
    allows\n   proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying\n   process,
    e.g. the originating IP number of a request or IP number of\n   the proxy on the
    incoming side.  Given a trusted path of proxying\n   components, each subsequent
    component will have access to all IP\n   numbers used in the chain of proxied
    HTTP requests.\n\n   This document also standardizes ways for a proxy administrator
    to\n   anonymize the origin of a request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
