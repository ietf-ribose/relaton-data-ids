abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications
    across\n   many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant\n
    \  messaging, and presence. In its current form, it allows session\n   invitations,
    instant messages, and other requests to be delivered\n   from one party to another
    without requiring explicit consent of the\n   recipient. Without such consent,
    it is possible for SIP to be used\n   for malicious purposes, including spam and
    denial-of-service attacks.\n   This document identifies a framework for consent-based
    communications\n   in SIP.\n\t </p>\n      "
