abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The ITU-T Rec. H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)\naddresses
    the combining of one or more elementary streams of video\nand audio, as well as
    other data, into single or multiple streams\nwhich are suitable for storage or
    transmission.  The necessary and\nsufficient information contained in the Program
    Specific\nInformation(PSI) tables to demultiplex and present programs must be\nacquired
    before a RTP receiver can process any data received in\nMPEG2-TS.  In this document,
    a Retransmission Server is specified to\ndeliver MPEG2-TS preamble prior to unicast
    burst RTP packets.  The\nRetransmission Server caches raw RTP packets with MPEG2-TS
    preamble\ninformation, and sends them to the RTP receiver which initiates rapid\nacquisition
    of MPEG2-TS multicast sessions.\n\t </p>\n      "
