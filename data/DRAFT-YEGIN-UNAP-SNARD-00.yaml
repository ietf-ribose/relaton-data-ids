abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet access through public networks require authentication
    of\nclients and networks to each other. While there are currently used\nlink-layer
    protocols such as PPP, it is very desirable to provide a\nnetwork-layer solution
    that can work across multiple types of links.\nAuthentication of roaming clients
    is generally handled by AAA\nprotocols. In order to use AAA between the network
    and the client, we\nneed a protocol to carry required messages. This draft defines
    how we\ncan extend the standard router discovery protocol to use it as a \ncarrier
    for the authentication purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
