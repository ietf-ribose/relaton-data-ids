abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft updates RFC7012 IPFIX information model by introducing\n
    \  several information elements (IEs) to enable IPFIX to export the BGP\n   community
    information, including BGP standard community defined in\n   RFC1997, BGP extended
    community defined in RFC4360, and BGP large\n   community defined in RFC8092.
    \ Network traffic flow information can\n   then be accumulated and analysed at
    the granularity specified by the\n   BGP communities, which is suitable for and
    needed by some traffic\n   optimization applications located in IPFIX collector,
    SDN controller\n   or PCE (Path Computation Element).\n\n   To clarify, no new
    BGP community attribute is defined in this\n   document and this document has
    no purpose to replace BGP Monitoring\n   Protocol BMP defined in RFC7854.  The
    IEs introduced in this document\n   are used by IPFIX together with other IEs
    to facilitate the IPFIX\n   collector analyzing the traffic in BGP community granularity
    without\n   running the heavy BGP protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
