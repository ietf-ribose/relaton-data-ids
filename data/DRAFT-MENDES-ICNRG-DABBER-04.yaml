abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER)\n
    \  protocol, which aims to extend the operation of distributed\n   Information
    Centric Networking frameworks to opportunistic wireless\n   networks such as Delay
    Tolerant Networks.  By \"opportunistic wireless\n   networks\" it is meant multi-hop
    wireless networks where finding an\n   end-to-end path between any pair of nodes
    at any moment in time may\n   be a challenge.  The goal is to assist in better
    defining\n   opportunities for the transmission of Interest and Data packets in
    a\n   store-carry-and-forward manner, based on a combination of proactive\n   and
    reactive approaches.  The document presents an architectural\n   overview of DABBER
    followed by the specification of the proactive\n   approach based on the dissemination
    of name-prefix information, and\n   the reactive approach based on the encounters
    probability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
