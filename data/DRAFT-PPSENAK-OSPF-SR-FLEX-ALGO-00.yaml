abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network
    based\n   on the IGP metric assigned to the links.  Many network deployments\n
    \  use RSVP-TE based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to\n   enforce
    traffic over a path that is computed using different metrics\n   or constraints
    than the shortest IGP path.  Various mechanisms are\n   used to steer the traffic
    towards such traffic engineered paths.\n   This document proposes a solution that
    allows IGPs themselves to\n   compute constraint based paths over the network
    without the use of\n   the above mentioned traffic engineering technologies.\n\n\t
