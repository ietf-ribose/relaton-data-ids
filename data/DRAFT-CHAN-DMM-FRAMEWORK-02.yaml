abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a framework for mobility management\n
    \  protocols in terms of their key, abstract logical functions.  We\n   explain
    how the framework is capable of presenting a unified view,\n   reducing the clutter
    that prevents a casual reader from understanding\n   the commonalities between
    different approaches in mobility\n   management.  A first order application of
    this framework is to enable\n   us to examine previously standardized mobility
    management protocols,\n   such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their
    extensions),\n   and describe their core functionality in terms of different\n
    \  configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.\n\n\t </p>\n
