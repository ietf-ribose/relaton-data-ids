abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a TCP/IP extension
    that is\n   widely implemented but hardly used due to the perceived unusablilty\n
    \  of ECN on many paths through the Internet caused by ECN-ignorant\n   routers
    and middleboxes.  This document specifies an ECN probing and\n   fall-back mechanism
    in case ECN has be successfully negotiated\n   between two connection endpoints,
    but might not be usable on the\n   path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
