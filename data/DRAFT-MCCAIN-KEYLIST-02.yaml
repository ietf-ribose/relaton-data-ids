abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client
    may\n   subscribe to an organization's keylist to keep its internal keystore\n
    \  up-to-date.  Ensuring that all members of an organization have their\n   colleagues'
    most recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining\n   operational security.
    \ Without the most recent keys and a source of\n   trust for those keys (as this
    document specifies), users must\n   manually update and sign each others keys
    -- a system that is\n   untenable in larger organizations.  This document proposes
    a\n   experimental format for the keylist file as well as requirements for\n   clients
    who wish to implement this experimental keylist subscription\n   functionality.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
