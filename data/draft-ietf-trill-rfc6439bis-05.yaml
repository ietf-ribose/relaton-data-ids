abstract:
- content: <p>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) supports multi-access
    LAN (Local Area Network) links where a single link can have multiple end stations
    and TRILL switches attached. Where multiple TRILL switches are attached to a link,
    native traffic to and from end stations on that link is handled by a subset of
    those TRILL switches called "Appointed Forwarders" as originally specified in
    RFC 6325, with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled by at most
    one TRILL switch. This document clarifies and updates the Appointed Forwarder
    mechanism. It updates RFCs 6325 and 7177 and obsoletes RFC 6439.</p>
