abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE).
    This scheme provides a variant of public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
    for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including
    one which authenticates possession of a pre-shared key, and two optional ones
    which authenticate possession of a KEM private key. HPKE works for any combination
    of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF),
    and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.
    Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations
    of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve
    Diffie-Hellman key agreement, HKDF, and SHA2. This document is a product of the
    Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
