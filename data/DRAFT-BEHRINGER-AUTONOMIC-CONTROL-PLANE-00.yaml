abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain scenarios, for example when bootstrapping a network,
    it is\n   desirable to automatically bring up a secure, routed control plane,\n
    \  which is independent of device configurations and global routing\n   table.
    \ This document describes an approach for an \"Autonomic Control\n   Plane\",
    which can be used as a \"virtual out of band channel\" - a\n   self-managing overlay
    network, which is independent of configuration,\n   addressing and routing on
    the data plane.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
