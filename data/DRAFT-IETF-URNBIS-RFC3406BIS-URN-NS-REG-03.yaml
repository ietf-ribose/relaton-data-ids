abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2141bis formalizes the concept of Uniform Resource Names
    (URNs)\n   for persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers within the\n
    \  generic URI system specified in RFC 3986.  To structure and organize\n   URN
    usage, RFC 2141bis specifies a hierarchy that divides the set of\n   possible
    URNs into \"URN Namespaces\" that can be individually defined\n   and managed.
    \ URN Namespaces allow to map existing identifier systems\n   into the URN scheme
    and thereby make available generic, network-based\n   resolution services for
    the identified resources (documents,\n   artifacts, and other objects) and metadata
    related to them.\n\n   To this end, URN Namespaces need to be defined and specified
    in a\n   comparable manner, and their Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) need to be\n
    \  registered with IANA, so that naming conflicts are avoided and\n   implementers
    of services can follow a structured approach in support\n   of various namespaces,
    guided by the registry to the related\n   documents and the particularities of
    specific namespaces, as\n   described in these Namespace registration documents.\n\n
    \  This RFC serves as a design guideline for stakeholders of URN\n   Namespaces
    and authors of URN Namespace definition and registration\n   documents.  It describes
    the process to be followed to register a URN\n   Namespace with IANA and the essential
    content of such documents.\n\n   This document supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.\n\n\t
