abstract:
- content: "<p>An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to communicate.
    For example, it will typically require an IP address and the address of a DNS
    server. This information is configured statically or obtained dynamically using
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to-Point Protocol/IP Control
    Protocol (PPP/IPCP). However, both DHCP and PPP/IPCP provide host configuration
    based on the access network. In Mobile IPv4, the registration process boots up
    a Mobile Node at an access network, also known as a foreign network. The information
    to configure the host needs to be based on the home network. This document describes
    the Cisco vendor-specific extensions to Mobile IPv4 to provide the base host configuration
    in Registration Request and Reply messages. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
