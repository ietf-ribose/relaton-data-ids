abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The DAD procedure for NCoA validation is a burden for achieving
    the \nfast MIPv6 handover. The existing stateless and DHCPv6-based stateful \nNCoA
    configuration schemes are all concerned with the DAD process at \nNAR. This document
    describes an NCoA address pool based stateful NCoA \nconfiguration for MIPv6 fast
    handover (FMIPv6). To reduce the DAD \nhandling time during the handover, the
    NCoA pools are established at \nNAR (in the reactive stateful scheme) or PAR (in
    the proactive \nstateful scheme). An NCoA pool maintains a list of NCoAs already
    \nconfirmed by the corresponding NAR. In response to a handover request, \nthe
    NAR or PAR will allocate a confirmed NCoA to the MN. By the \naddress pool based
    stateful NCoA configuration, the handover latency \ncan be significantly reduced,
    and a tunneling for handover can be \nextended to an NCoA address, instead of
    NAR. \n     \n\t </p>\n      "
