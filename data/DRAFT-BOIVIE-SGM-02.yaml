abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multicast has become increasingly important with the emergence
    of\nnetwork-based applications such as IP telephony and video\nconferencing. The
    Internet community has done a significant amount\nof work on IP multicast over
    the last decade [1-10] and as a\nresult, there are a number of multicast applications
    that are used\ntoday on the Mbone, the multicast-capable virtual network that
    is\nlayered on top of (portions of) the Internet [10]. However, while\ntoday's
    multicast schemes are scaleable in the sense that they can\nsupport very large
    multicast groups, there are scalability issues\nwhen a network needs to support
    a very large number of distinct\nmulticast groups. This document describes a new
    scheme for\nmulticast that complements the existing schemes. Whereas the\nexisting
    schemes can support a limited number of very large\nmulticast groups, the scheme
    described here can support a very\nlarge number of small multicast groups.\n\t
