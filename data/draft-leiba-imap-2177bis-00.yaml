abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Access Protocol requires a client to poll the
    server for changes to the selected mailbox (new mail, deletions). It's often more
    desirable to have the server transmit updates to the client in real time. This
    allows a user to see new mail immediately. It also helps some real-time applications
    based on IMAP, which might otherwise need to poll extremely often (such as every
    few seconds). (While the spec actually does allow a server to push EXISTS responses
    asynchronously, a client can't expect this behaviour and must poll.) This document
    specifies the syntax of an IDLE command, which will allow a client to tell the
    server that it's ready to accept such real-time updates.</p>"
