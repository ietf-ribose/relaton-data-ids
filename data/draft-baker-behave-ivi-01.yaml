abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This note proposes an address and service architecture designed
    tofacilitate transition from an IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet.This service
    contains three parts: A DNS Application Layer Gateway, astateful Network Address
    Translator that enables IPv6 clients toinitiate connections to IPv4 servers and
    peers, and a statelessNetwork Address Translator that enables IPv4 and IPv6 systems
    tointeroperate freely.It is couched as an update to RFCs 2765 and 2766. This is
    becausethe stateless service is essentially the SIIT with a differentaddress format,
    and because the DNS Application Layer Gateway and thestateful translator have
    significant similarities to NAT-PT. Thereare, however, important differences from
    NAT-PT, responsive to theissues raised in RFC 4966.</p>"
