abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes identifier-locator addressing
    (ILA) for\n   IPv6. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location\n
    \  and identity of a network node. Part of an address expresses the\n   immutable
    identity of the node, and another part indicates the\n   location of the node
    which can be dynamic. Identifier-locator\n   addressing can be used to efficiently
    implement overlay networks for\n   network virtualization as well as solutions
    for use cases in\n   mobility.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
