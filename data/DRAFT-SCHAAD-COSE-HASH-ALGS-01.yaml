abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax\n   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]
    does not define any direct methods\n   for using hash algorithms.  There are however
    circumstances where\n   hash algorithms are used: Indirect signatures where the
    hash of one\n   or more contents are signed.  X.509 certificate or other object\n
    \  identification by the use of a thumbprint.  This document defines a\n   set
    of hash algorithms that are identified by COSE Algorithm\n   Identifiers.\n\n\t
