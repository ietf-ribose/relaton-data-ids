abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document specifies SIP Certificate Authentication (SCA),
    a\n   challenge-response mechanism that uses public key cryptography to\n   perform
    certificate-based authentication in Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) based
    architectures.  Performing authentication in SIP\n   with certificates will provide
    stronger authentication capabilities\n   and increase possible deployment scenarios
    in SIP networks.  The\n   scope is limited to the authentication of the SIP UA
    to the SIP\n   Service Provider's network.  It does not include UA to UA\n   authentication
    within its scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
