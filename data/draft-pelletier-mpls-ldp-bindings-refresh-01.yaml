abstract:
- content: <p>There are situations when there is a need for performing consistency
    checks for LDP binding state (address/label bindings) exchanged between LDP speakers.
    For instance, a state refresh may be required to detect and purge stale bindings
    received by an LDP speaker, which have resulted from an in-service software upgrade.
    This document specifies mechanics that allow a sender LDP speaker to enclose the
    initial binding advertisements (or re-advertisements) between explicit START and
    END of binding markers, thus helping the receiving LDP speaker to detect and purge
    any extra/stale binding state previously learnt from the sender. In addition to
    the definition of new LDP Notification message status codes for bindings refresh,
    this document also extends LDP base specification by introducing the concept of
    "Wildcard Address" and a new "Wildcard Address Request" message.</p>
