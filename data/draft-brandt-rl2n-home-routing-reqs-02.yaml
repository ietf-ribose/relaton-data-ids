abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents the home control and automation applicationspecific
    requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks(RL2N). In a modern home,
    a high number of wireless devices are usedfor a wide set of purposes. Examples
    include lighting controlmodules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature
    sensors,gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,healthcare
    systems and advanced remote controls. Because suchdevices only cover a limited
    radio range, multi-hop routing is oftenrequired. Such devices are usually highly
    constrained in terms ofresources such as battery and memory and operate in unstableenvironments.
    The aim of this document is to specify the routingrequirements for networks comprising
    such constrained devices in ahome network environment.</p>"
