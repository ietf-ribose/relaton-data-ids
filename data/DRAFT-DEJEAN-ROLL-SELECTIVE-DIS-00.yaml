abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies DIS options that enrich the potential\nbehavior
    of the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks\n(RPL) specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].\n\nThe
    goal is to enable new leaf nodes to quickly discover and attach\nto the routing
    structure, without having to wait for spontaneous DIO\ntransmissions by neighbour
    routers and without causing them to reset\ntheir DIO timers.\n\t </p>\n      "
