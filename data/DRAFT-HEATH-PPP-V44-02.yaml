abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Point-to-Point Protocol [PPP] provides a standard means for\ntransporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\nThe PPP Compression Control
    Protocol [CCP] provides a means to\nnegotiate and utilize compression protocols
    over PPP encapsulated\nlinks.\nThis memo describes a means for compressing PPP
    encapsulated \ndatagrams by utilizing the data compression algorithm that is \ndescribed
    in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) \nRecommendation V.44 [V44].
    \ Recommendation V.44 is a modem standard \nbut Annex B of the recommendation
    describes the implementation of\nV.44 in packet networks.  This memo defines the
    application of V.44, \nwith single or multiple compression dictionaries,to the
    PPP \nCompression Control Protocol (RFC 1962).\n\t </p>\n      "
