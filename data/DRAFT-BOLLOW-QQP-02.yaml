abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QQP protocol specifies a method for transmitting multiple\n
    \  webservice requests and responses between two Hosts.  QQP plays\n   the role
    of transport protocol for the QRPC webservice protocol,\n   similar to how XML-RPC
    and SOAP often use HTTP over TCP as\n   transport protocol.\n\n   QQP is called
    the \"Quick Queues Protocol\" because it is faster\n   than transmitting XML data
    via HTTP over TCP for several reasons.\n   QQP is also designed to handle Internet
    Protocol multihoming,\n   hiding IP address changes from application layer software
    without\n   need for introducing an additional protocol layer for that purpose.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
