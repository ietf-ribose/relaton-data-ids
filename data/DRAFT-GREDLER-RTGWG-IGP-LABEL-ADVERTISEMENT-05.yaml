abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by session
    oriented\n   protocols.  In order to obtain a particular routers label binding
    for\n   a given destination FEC one needs to have first an established\n   session
    with that node.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism to distribute FEC/label
    mappings\n   through flooding protocols.  Flooding protocols publish their objects\n
    \  for an unknown set of receivers, therefore one can efficiently scale\n   label
    distribution for use cases where the receiver of label\n   information is not
    directly connected.\n\n   Application of this technique are found in the field
    of backup\n   (Bypass, R-LFA) routing, Label switched path stitching, egress\n
    \  protection, explicit routing and egress ASBR link selection.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
