abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services\n
    \  such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others.\n   Currently
    application decisions are made with little information\n   concerning underlying
    network used to deliver those services so that\n   such decisions cannot be the
    most optimal from both network and\n   application resource utilization and quality
    of service objectives.\n\n   This document presents a novel architecture of Cross
    Stratum\n   Optimization for application and network resource in dynamic optical\n
    \  networks.  Several global load balancing strategies are proposed and\n   demonstrated
    by experiments in Optical as a Service experimental\n   environment.\n\n\t </p>\n
