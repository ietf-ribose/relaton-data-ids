abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A mobile node (MN) can connect to the network by using multiple\ninterfaces
    simultaneously or sequentially.  The quality of each\nconnection can be changed
    due to many reasons such as the movement of\nthe MN and the interference from
    the network.  To guarantee the\nquality of service, some flows can be moved from
    a bad connection to\nanother better one.  In this draft we discuss about how to
    extend the\nProxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support such kind of flow mobility.\n\t
