abstract:
- content: "<p>The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended
    the base ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent a more detailed
    view of the network which contains not only end-to-end costs but also information
    about shared bottlenecks. However, the view computed by straw man algorithms can
    contain redundant information and result in unnecessary communication overhead.
    The situation gets even worse when certain ALTO extensions are enabled, for example,
    the incremental update extension [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse] which continuously
    pushes data changes to ALTO clients. Redundant information can trigger unnecessary
    updates. In this document, several algorithms are described which can effectively
    reduce the redundancy in the network view while still providing the same information
    as in the original path vectors.</p>"
