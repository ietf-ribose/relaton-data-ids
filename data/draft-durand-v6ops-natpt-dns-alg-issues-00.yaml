abstract:
  content: "<p>Recent discussions on the need to translate or not between IPv4 andIPv6
    have brought a better understanding on the impact of tools likeNAT-PT [NAT-PT].
    Several problems have been identified around theDNS ALG functionality. An alternative
    solution that does not requirethis DNS ALG for connections initiated by the IPv6
    side has beenproposed. This memo aims at analyzing the pros and cons of bothsolutions
    in that case. Connections initiated by the IPv4 side wouldalways require the help
    of a DNS-ALG and thus are not covered by thismemo.</p>"
