- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
    that refers to detecting and reporting link failures. OAM mechanisms have been
    defined for various layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety
    of protocols. This document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have
    been defined and are currently being defined by the IETF, as well as a comparison
    to other OAM mechanisms that have been defined by the IEEE and ITU-T.</p>"
