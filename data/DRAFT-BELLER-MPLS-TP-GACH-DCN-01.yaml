abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Generic Associated Channel (G-ACH) has been defined as an extension\nof
    the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (ACH) to enable the\nrealization of a
    control/communication channel associated with\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs),\nMPLS pseudowires (PWs), MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS
    sections between\nadjacent MPLS-capable devices.\n\nThe MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLS\narchitecture that identifies elements of the
    MPLS toolkit that may be\ncombined to build a carrier grade packet transport network
    based on\nMPLS packet switching technology.\n\nThis document describes how the
    G-ACH may be used to provide the\ninfrastructure that forms part of the Management
    Communication\nNetwork (MCN) and a Signaling Communication Network (SCN).\nCollectively,
    the MCN and SCN may be referred to as the Data\nCommunication Network (DCN). The
    document explains how MCN and SCN\npackets are encapsulated, carried on the G-ACH,
    and demultiplexed for\n\t </p>\n      "
