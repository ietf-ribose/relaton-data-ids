abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of virtualization technologies, starting from the
    physical layer and going all the way up to the application plane, is transforming
    the telecom network infrastructure onto an agile, model- driven production environment
    for communication services. Carrier- grade network management was optimized for
    environments built with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment,
    integration and maintenance efforts from network service providers. The DevOps
    movement in the data center is a source of inspiration regarding how to simplify
    and automate management processes for software-defined infrastructure. This first
    version of this draft identifies three areas that we consider key to applying
    DevOps principles in a telecom service provider environment, namely for monitoring,
    verification and troubleshooting processes. Finally, we introduce challenges associated
    with operationalizing DevOps principles at scale in software-defined telecom networks.</p>"
