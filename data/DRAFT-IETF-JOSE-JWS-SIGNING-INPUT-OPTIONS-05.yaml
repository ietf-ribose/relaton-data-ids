abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents the payload of a JWS as
    a\n   base64url encoded value and uses this value in the JWS Signature\n   computation.
    \ While this enables arbitrary payloads to be integrity\n   protected, some have
    described use cases in which the base64url\n   encoding is unnecessary and/or
    an impediment to adoption, especially\n   when the payload is large and/or detached.
    \ This specification\n   defines a means of accommodating these use cases by defining
    an\n   option to change the JWS Signing Input computation to not base64url-\n
    \  encode the payload.  This option is intended to broaden the set of\n   use
    cases for which the use of JWS is a good fit.\n\n   This specification updates
    RFC 7519 by prohibiting the use of this\n   option in JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
