abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and\n
    \  Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization
    can express domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation,
    disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving\n   organization can use to
    improve mail handling.  DMARC policies can be\n   applied at the individual domain
    level or for a set of domains at the\n   organizational level.  The design of
    DMARC precludes grouping\n   policies for a set of domains above the organizational
    level, such as\n   TLDs (Top Level Domains).  These types of domains (which are
    not all\n   at the top level of the DNS tree) can be collectively referred to
    as\n   Public Suffix Domains (PSDs).  For the subset of PSDs that require\n   DMARC
    usage, this memo describes an extension to DMARC to enable\n   DMARC functionality
    for such domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
