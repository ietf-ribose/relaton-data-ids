abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet
    in the real IP world. It shows how to reorganize the provider network with a large
    address space. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy can be
    established based on fragmenting the entire space into some regions and some sub
    regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this
    architecture in the context of IPv6.</p>"
