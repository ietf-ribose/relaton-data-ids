abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Designated Forwarder (DF) in EVPN networks is the PE responsible\n
    \  for sending multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast traffic to a\n   multi-homed
    CE, on a given Ethernet Tag on a particular Ethernet\n   Segment (ES). The DF
    is selected based on the list of PEs that\n   advertise the Ethernet Segment Identifier
    (ESI) to the EVPN network.\n   While PE node or link failures trigger the DF re-election
    for a given\n   &lt;ESI, EVI&gt;, individual Attachment Circuit (AC) or MAC-VRF
    failures do\n   not trigger such DF re-election and the traffic may therefore
    be\n   permanently impacted, even though there is an alternative path. This\n
    \  document improves the DF election algorithm so that the AC status can\n   influence
    the result of the election and this type of \"logical\"\n   failures can be protected
    too.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
