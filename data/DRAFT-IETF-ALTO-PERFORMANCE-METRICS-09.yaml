abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and is used in basic ALTO services including\n   both
    the cost map service and the endpoint cost service.\n\n   Different applications
    may use different cost metrics, but the ALTO\n   base protocol [RFC7285] documents
    only one single cost metric, i.e.,\n   the generic \"routingcost\" metric; see
    Sec. 14.2 of [RFC7285].  Hence,\n   if the resource consumer of an application
    prefers a resource\n   provider that offers low-delay delivery to the resource
    consumer, the\n   base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.\n\n
    \  ALTO cost metrics can be generic metrics and this document focuses on\n   network
    performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet\n   loss, hop count,
    and bandwidth.\n\n   When using an ALTO performance metric, an application may
    need\n   additional contextual information beyond the metric value.  For\n   example,
    whether the metric is an estimation based on measurements or\n   a service-level
    agreement (SLA) can define the meaning of a\n   performance metric.  Hence, this
    document introduces an additional\n   \"cost-context\" field to the ALTO \"cost-type\"
    field to convey such\n   information.  To report an estimated value of a performance
    metric,\n   the ALTO server may derive and aggregate from routing protocols with\n
    \  different granularity and scope, such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE,\n   or
    from end-to-end traffic management tools.  These metrics may then\n   be exposed
    by an ALTO Server to allow applications to determine\n   \"where\" to connect
    based on network performance criteria.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
