abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP)\n[RFC3748] method for identity distribution, authentication and\nsession
    key distribution using the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG)\nTrusted Platform Module
    (TPM).  The TPM has been defined by the TCG\nin order to establish a root of trust
    and measurements in (consumer)\ncomputers.  It provides several cryptographic
    functions and a secure\nstorage for keys and hashes.  There is also a TPM specification
    for\nmobile devices called Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which can also be\nused
    for EAP-TPM.  This new EAP method allows network authentication,\nwhich also supports
    user anonymity, the usage of different user\nidentities for the authentication
    with different network operators,\nresult indication, and a fast re-authentication.\n\t
