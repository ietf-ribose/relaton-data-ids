abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL (Transparent\n
    \  Interconnection of Lots of Links, RFC 6325) protocol. The Link Layer\n   Discovery
    Protocol (LLDP, IEEE Std 802.1AB) is a one-way,\n   unacknowledged protocol for
    the announcement of a station's\n   capabilities to its peers.  The set of peers
    that receive these\n   frames and the scoping of the frame is primarily determined
    by the\n   destination MAC address of the LLDP frame.  This document specifies
    a\n   Nearest-RBridge MAC address and other details of TRILL support of\n   LLDP.
    It updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
