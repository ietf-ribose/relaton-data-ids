abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared
    Keys\n   (PSKs) in TLS.  It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs\n   under
    certain assumptions and demonstrates how violations of these\n   assumptions lead
    to attacks.  This document also discusses PSK use\n   cases, provisioning processes,
    and TLS stack implementation support\n   in the context of these assumptions.
    \ It provides advice for\n   applications in various use cases to help meet these
    assumptions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
