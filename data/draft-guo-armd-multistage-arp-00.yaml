abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method to reduce the ARP broadcast in L2 networks.
    There will be two MAC tables in the aggregation switches which answer for the
    ARP responses and packet forwarding. Multicast will take the place of broadcast
    for ARP request in this document which will lead to the reduction of the numbers
    of ARP broadcast packets in L2 networks.</p>"
