abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes some of the ways in which parts of the
    MIME\nsystem, originally designed for electronic mail, have been used in\nthe
    Web, and some of the ways in which those uses have resulted in\ndifficulties.
    \ Given this background and justification, this document\nthen goes on to outline
    requirements for changes to MIME registries\nand practices for their use within
    W3C and IETF, in order to address\nthose difficulties.  Within IETF, it is expected
    that a companion\nBest Current Practice document will make specific changes to
    the\nInternet Media Types and Charset registries, among others.\n\t </p>\n      "
