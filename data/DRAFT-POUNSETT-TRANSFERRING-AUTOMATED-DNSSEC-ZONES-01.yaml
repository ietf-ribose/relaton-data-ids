abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Section 4.3.5.1 of [RFC6781] \"DNSSEC Operational Practices,
    version\n   2\" describes a procedure for transitioning a DNSSEC signed zone from\n
    \  one (cooperative) operator to another.  The procedure works well in\n   many
    situations, but makes the assumption that it is feasible for the\n   two operators
    to simultaneously publish slightly different versions\n   of the zone being transferred.
    \ In some cases, such as with TLD\n   registries, operational considerations require
    both operators to\n   publish identical versions of the zone for the duration
    of the\n   transition.  This document describes a modified transition procedure\n
    \  which can be used in these cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
