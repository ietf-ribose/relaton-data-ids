abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of
    TCP\n   traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of\n   unencrypted
    traffic can be attributed to at least two factors.\n   First, some legacy protocols
    lack a signaling mechanism (such as a\n   \"STARTTLS\" command) by which to convey
    support for encryption, making\n   incremental deployment impossible.  Second,
    legacy applications\n   themselves cannot always be upgraded, requiring a way
    to implement\n   encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.
    \ The\n   TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these\n
    \  problems through a new TCP option-kind providing out-of-band, fully\n   backward-compatible
    negotiation of encryption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
