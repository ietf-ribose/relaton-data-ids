abstract:
- content: "<p>To improve network resource utilization and reduce the operation expense,
    the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation conception is raised [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].
    This document describes the information model for the interface between Control-
    Plane and User-Plane separation BNG. This information model may involve both control
    channel interface and configuration channel interface. The interface for control
    channel allows the Control- Plane to send several flow tables to the User-Plane,
    such as user's information table, user's interface table, and user's QoS table,
    etc. And it also allows the User-Plane to report the resources and statistics
    information to the Control-Plane. The interface for configuration channel is in
    charge of the version negotiation of protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane,
    the configuration for devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane, and the reports
    of User- Plane's capabilities, etc. The information model defined in this document
    enables defining a standardized data model. Such a data model can be used to define
    an interface to the CU separation BNG.</p>"
