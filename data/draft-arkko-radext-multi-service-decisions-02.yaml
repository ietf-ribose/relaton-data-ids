abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft relates to the use of Authentication, Authorization, and
    Accounting (AAA) where the same user credentials can be used on many different
    types of devices, ranging from wireless access points to Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) gateways. This draft discusses how to use existing AAA and authentication
    protocols and extensions to determine what service was provided, agree about this
    among all the participating parties, and use this information as a basis for policy
    decisions.</p>"
