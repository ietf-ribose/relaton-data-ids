abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes open research challenges for network virtualization.
    Network virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud
    computing. Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions
    (e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to
    remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet. In a similar manner,
    network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated
    physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources. However, network virtualization
    can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not
    only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves
    abstraction of the network itself. This document describes current research and
    engineering challenges in network virtualization including guaranteeing quality-of-service,
    performance improvement, supporting multiple domains, network slicing, service
    composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control
    concerns, network function placement and testing. In addition, some proposals
    are made for new activities in IETF/IRTF that could address some of these challenges.</p>"
