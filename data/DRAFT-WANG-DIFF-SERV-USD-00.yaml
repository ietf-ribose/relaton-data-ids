abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this memo, we present a new differentiated service scheme
    called\n   ''User-Share Differentiation (USD)''. The USD scheme is based on the\n
    \  principle of link sharing. The scheme allows ISPs to differentiate\n   traffic
    flows on a per-user basis, providing minimum bandwidth guar-\n   antee and share-based
    bandwidth sharing. We first look at the objec-\n   tives of differentiated services,
    and the problems with the current\n   proposals, then present the details of the
    USD scheme.  Finally we\n   examine the implementation and standardization issues\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
