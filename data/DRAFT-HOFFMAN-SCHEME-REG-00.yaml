abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document revises the registration procedures given in
    RFC 2717\n   based on five years of experience.  It simplifies the requirements\n
    \  for getting a scheme listed by IANA by removing the technical review\n   and
    allowing multiple registrants to share a scheme name.\n\t </p>\n      "
