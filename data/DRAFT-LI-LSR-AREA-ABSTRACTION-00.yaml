abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Link state routing protocols have hierarchical abstraction
    already\n   built into them.  However, when lower levels are used for transit,\n
    \  they must expose their internal topologies, leading to scale issues.\n\n   To
    avoid this, this document discusses extensions to the IS-IS\n   routing protocol
    that would allow level 1 areas to provide transit,\n   yet only inject an abstraction
    of the level 1 topology into level 2.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
