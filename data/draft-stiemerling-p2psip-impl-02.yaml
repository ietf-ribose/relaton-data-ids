abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo is an implementation report about the peer-to-peer SIPsystem
    developed in the European IST Ambient Networks researchproject. This system replaces
    the traditional SIP proxy-registrarfunction with a distributed lookup mechanism,
    adds overlayfunctionality to the SIP signalling and to RTP traffic, takes careabout
    media/packet relay lookup and insertion into the SIP/RTP paths,plus automatic
    adaptation of the voice transmission according tochanging network conditions.
    Standard, unmodified SIP user agentsare used for communication. The presented
    system is work in progressand this memo is an attempt to gather IETF community
    feedback aboutthe described approach.</p>"
