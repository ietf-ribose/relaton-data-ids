abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery that
    allow routers to ask hosts to periodically register. Two types of registrations
    are defined: to register with an AAA server using an AAA protocol, and to register
    with the routers using unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement messages to allow hosts
    to move between some links while keeping the same IPv6 address. In the latter
    case the routers would use the registrations to inject host routes in a 'local
    area'. The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion on how to make
    IPv6 a good choice for wireless networks that have requirements on 'local' mobility
    and/or AAA functionality.</p>"
