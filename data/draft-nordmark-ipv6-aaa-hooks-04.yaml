abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery thatallow
    routers to ask hosts to periodically register. Two types ofregistrations are defined:
    to register with an AAA server using anAAA protocol, and to register with the
    routers using unsolicitedNeighbor Advertisement messages to allow hosts to move
    between somelinks while keeping the same IPv6 address. In the latter case therouters
    would use the registrations to inject host routes in a 'localarea'.The purpose
    of this document is to stimulate discussion on how tomake IPv6 a good choice for
    wireless networks that have requirementson 'local' mobility and/or AAA functionality.</p>"
