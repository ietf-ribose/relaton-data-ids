abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud computing is rapidly gaining importance, not only because\n
    \  of being ubiquitous, but also, due to ease of management of hugely\n   increasing
    data, specially, multimedia contents. The next era is\n   going to be of cloud
    federation, in which services would be brought\n   up to the user through multiple
    clouds, creating an Inter-Cloud\n   computing environment. On the other hand,
    increase in multimedia\n   content requires much better service provisioning,
    responsiveness,\n   and efficient transcoding. Thoroughly designing the architecture\n
    \  of Media Cloud Inter-Cloud Computing is today's requirement.\n   This document
    focuses on this important issue and presents\n   architectural fundamentals and
    key concerns in\n   Media Cloud Inter-Cloud Computing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
