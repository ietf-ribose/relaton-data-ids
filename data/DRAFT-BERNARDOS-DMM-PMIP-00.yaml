abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected
    to be\n   ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a\n   limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are\n   intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6.  For\n   this reason it has been waved a need
    for distributed and dynamic\n   mobility management approaches, with the objective
    of reducing\n   operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient\n
    \  architecture.\n\n   This draft describes a solution to distribute the data
    forwarding\n   plane on Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains, thus trying to overcome the\n
    \  suboptimal data path introduced when the LMA is traversed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
