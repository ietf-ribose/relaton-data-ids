abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Sometimes stateful DHCPv6 address configuration and SLAAC may
    be both\n   available in one network. In ND protocol, there is a \"M\" (ManagedFlag)\n
    \  flag defined in RA message, which indicates the hosts the DHCPv6\n   service
    is available. But for some reason, the ND protocol didn't\n   define the flag
    as prescriptive but only advisory. This draft\n   proposes to use two reserved
    bits in RA message to let the network\n   control the hosts that which address
    configuration mode should be\n   used. This feature is useful for management,
    especially in a\n   renumbering event.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
