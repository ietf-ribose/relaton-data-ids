abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for extending pseudowire emulation
    across multiple packet switched network (PSN) segments. Scenarios are discussed
    where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated service spans a different
    provider's PSN, as are other scenarios where the emulated service originates and
    terminates on the same provider's PSN, but may pass through several PSN tunnel
    segments in that PSN. It presents an architectural framework for such multi-segment
    pseudowires, defines terminology, and specifies the various protocol elements
    and their functions. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
