abstract:
  content: "<p>Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) applications, such as video conference, interactive distance learning,
    replicated database, distributed computing, and so on. However, on the one hand,
    the low-rate multicasting traffic demands cannot make full use of the capacity
    of the entire wavelength, and on the other hand, new services such as data center
    migration and cloud applications need higher transmission rates and higher spectrum
    efficiency. Flexi-grid network is an effective solution to address the problem
    of transmission rate and spectrum utilization. It overcomes the fixed grid constraint
    of Wavelength Swithched Optical Network (WSON) by using advanced technologies
    such as coherent detection and Bandwidth Variable- Wavelength Selective Switches
    (BV-WSS). Therefore, it is essential to exploit multicasting over flexi-grid networks.
    This document covers the requirements for supporting P2MP over flexi-grid infrastructure.
    Specifically, the scope of requirements listed in this document covers the functionality
    that should be supported by the control plane.</p>"
