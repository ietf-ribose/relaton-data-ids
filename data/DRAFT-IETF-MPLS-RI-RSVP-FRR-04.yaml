abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RSVP-TE relies on periodic refresh of RSVP messages to synchronize\n
    \  and maintain the LSP related states along the reserved path.  In the\n   absence
    of refresh messages, the LSP related states are automatically\n   deleted.  Reliance
    on periodic refreshes and refresh timeouts are\n   problematic from the scalability
    point of view.  The number of RSVP-\n   TE LSPs that a router needs to maintain
    has been growing in service\n   provider networks and the implementations should
    be capable of\n   handling increase in LSP scale.\n\n   RFC 2961 specifies mechanisms
    to eliminate the reliance on periodic\n   refresh and refresh timeout of RSVP
    messages, and enables a router to\n   increase the message refresh interval to
    values much longer than the\n   default 30 seconds defined in RFC 2205.  However,
    the protocol\n   extensions defined in RFC 4090 for supporting fast reroute (FRR)\n
    \  using bypass tunnels implicitly rely on short refresh timeouts to\n   cleanup
    stale states.\n\n   In order to eliminate the reliance on refresh timeouts, the
    routers\n   should unambiguously determine when a particular LSP state should
    be\n   deleted.  Coupling LSP state with the corresponding RSVP-TE signaling\n
    \  adjacencies as recommended in RFC 8370 will apply in scenarios other\n   than
    RFC 4090 FRR using bypass tunnels.  In scenarios involving RFC\n   4090 FRR using
    bypass tunnels, additional explicit tear down messages\n   are necessary.  Refresh-interval
    Independent RSVP FRR (RI-RSVP-FRR)\n   extensions specified in this document consists
    of procedures to\n   enable LSP state cleanup that are essential in scenarios
    not covered\n   by procedures defined in RSVP-TE Scaling Recommendations.  Hence,\n
    \  this document updates the procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support\n   Refresh-Interval
    Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) capability specified in\n   RFC 8370.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
