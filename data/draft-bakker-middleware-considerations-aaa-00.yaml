- content: "<p>The IETF AAA Working Group is currently looking at defining the requirements
    for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting. Various documents have already
    been written that outline AAA requirements for various services and protocols.
    This document falls into that category, as it outlines some ideas for middleware
    that have specific AAA requirements.</p>"
