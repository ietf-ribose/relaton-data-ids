abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is used as the only routing protocol in some networks today. In
    such networks, it is useful to get a detailed view of the nodes and underlying
    links in the topology along with their attributes similar to one available when
    using link state routing protocols. Such a view of a BGP-only fabric enables use
    cases like traffic engineering and forwarding of services along paths other than
    the BGP best path selection. This document defines extensions to the BGP Link-state
    address-family (BGP-LS) and the procedures for advertisement of the topology in
    a BGP-only network. It also describes a specific use-case for traffic engineering
    based on Segment Routing.</p>"
