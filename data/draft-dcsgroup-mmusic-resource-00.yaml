abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a two-stage call-setup mechanism, with the
    resource management protocol interleaved between the two stages. The objective
    of such a mechanism is to enable deployment of robust IP Telephony services. The
    first phase ensures that resources are made available before the phone rings and
    the participants of the call are 'invited' to participate. The second phase involves
    the alerting of the user after the network resources are reserved. This draft
    presents the call signaling requirements that lead to this design, and the specific
    SIP extension of an INVITE that does not ring the far-end phone.</p>"
