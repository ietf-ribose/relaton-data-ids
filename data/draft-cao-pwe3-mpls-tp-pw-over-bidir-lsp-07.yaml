abstract:
- content: "<p>Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of
    Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional LSP or two
    LSPs that share the same routes. In addition, the user traffic may traverse through
    multiple transport networks. This document specifies an optional extension in
    LDP that enable the binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.</p>"
