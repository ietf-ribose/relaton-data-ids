abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the motivation, desirable properties,
    system\n   model, roles/responsibilities, and component models associated with\n
    \  an asynchronous management architecture (AMA) suitable for providing\n   application-level
    network management services in a challenged\n   networking environment.  Challenged
    networks are those that require\n   fault protection, configuration, and performance
    reporting while\n   unable to provide human-in-the-loop operations centers with\n
    \  synchronous feedback in the context of administrative sessions.  In\n   such
    a context, networks must exhibit behavior that is both\n   deterministic and autonomous
    while maintaining compatibility with\n   existing network management protocols
    and operational concepts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
