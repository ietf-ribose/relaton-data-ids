abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With LCAS and VCAT, the transport layer is capable of not only\nproviding
    right-sized data pipes, but also elastic pipes. Fluid\ntransport pipes spur services
    like frame-relay transport (CIR, EIR)\nand intelligent COS-aware protection. The
    popular protocol used to\nconvey control information in SONET networks is GMPLS.
    There are two\naspects of control mechanisms for a connection: call-control and\nconnection-control.
    Call-control is used to establish a signaling\nassociation between two end-points,
    whereas connection-control is\nused to setup and modify the attributes (e.g.,
    bandwidth) of an\ntransport connection. This draft deals with signaling requirements\nfor
    connection-control of elastic pipes.\n\t </p>\n      "
