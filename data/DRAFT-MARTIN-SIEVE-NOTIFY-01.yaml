abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible
    that\nthey have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling\nto check
    for new messages periodically. A push method handled by the\nfinal delivery agent
    gives users quicker notifications and saves\nserver resources. This document does
    not specify the notification\nmethod but is expected that using existing instant
    messaging\ninfrastructure such as Zephyr, ICQ, or SMS messages will be popular.\nThis
    draft describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering\nlanguage that allows
    users to give specific preferences for\nnotification of Sieve actions.\n\t </p>\n
