abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been
    \nchartered to standardize reliable multicast transport services and \nprotocol
    instantiations, which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) \nprotocol. This document
    is concerned with defining the building \nblock for auto-configuration of the
    logical ACK-tree. According to \nthe charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained
    modular \ncomponent that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract \nAPIs
    that define a building block's access methods and their \narguments.' The TRACK
    BB mechanisms [5] will operate on the logical \nACK-tree that is configured by
    this TREE BB in the TRACK PI \nsessions. This document is made based on the guidelines
    for the RMT \nBB [2] and the recommendations for TREE BB [4].\n\t </p>\n      "
