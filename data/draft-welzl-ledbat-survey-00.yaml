abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a survey of transport protocols which are designed
    to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard
    TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used
    for low-priority "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called
    a "less than" (or "lower than") best effort service.</p>
