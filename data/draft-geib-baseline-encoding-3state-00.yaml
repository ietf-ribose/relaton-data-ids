abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Layer 2 transport services like MPLS offer only 2 states to encodeECN
    state, if DiffServ based Class of Service is operated. Still, amechanism by which
    PCN egress nodes can differentiate between thenormal behaviour state, admission
    stop state control state and flowtermination state, by using PCN marking of packets
    is desirable.This document describes how threshold and excess marking can becombined
    with PCN baseline encoding. A minimalistic approach likethe one described in the
    following has some obvious shortcomings.These shortcomings are also presented
    and discussed. Currently, theaim of this document is to trigger experimentation
    feasabilitystudies. Standardisation will be pursued in the future based on theresults
    of the studies.</p>"
