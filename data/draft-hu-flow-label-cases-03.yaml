abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 protocol includes a flow label in every packet header, but
    this field is not used in practice. This paper describes the flow label standard
    and discusses the implementation issues that it raises. It then describes various
    published proposals for using the flow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent
    with the standard. Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed. We also
    question whether the standard should be revised. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
