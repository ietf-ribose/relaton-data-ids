abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) (RFC-2045, RFC-2046,\n
    \  RFC-2047, RFC-2231) and various other Internet protocols are capable\n   of
    using many different charsets.  This in turn means that the\n   ability to label
    different charsets is essential.\n\n   This document obsoletes the IANA Charset
    Registration Procedures\n   originally defined in [RFC2978].  Specifically, this
    document\n   completely revises the registration procedures and the charset\n
    \  registries.  The charset registry is now divided into three parts\n   with
    separate registration procedures for each.\n\n   Note: The charset registration
    procedure exists solely to associate a\n   specific name or names with a given
    charset and to give an indication\n   of whether or not a given charset can be
    used in MIME text objects.\n   In particular, the general applicability and appropriateness
    of a\n   given registered charset to a particular application is a protocol\n
    \  issue, not a registration issue, and is not dealt with by this\n   registration
    procedure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
