abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime\n
    \  communication between systems that are generally disconnected,\n   requiring
    multiple network hops between source and destination, that\n   may never be fully
    connected end-to-end at any given time.  This\n   document describes a number
    of use cases that motivate having a\n   standard method to communicate between
    such systems, as multi-\n   organization and multi-vendor support and interoperability
    is highly\n   desirable.  These include dismounted soldiers, sensorwebs, medical\n
    \  devices, animal tracking, low-earth-orbiting satellites and data mule\n   scenarios.
    \ To avoid confusion in terminology when trying to focus on\n   the problem and
    requirements without bias towards particular\n   technical solutions, at this
    time, we refer to the protocol instances\n   that would support such communications
    as Store, Carry, and\n   Forwarding (SCF) agents, and refer to their activity
    as SCF\n   networking.  The concepts involved in SCF networking are not entirely\n
    \  new and several facets of the problem have been solved in multiple\n   incompatible
    ways in existing or historic systems.  This document\n   describes the core SCF
    problem and gives an assessment of the ability\n   to use existing technologies
    as solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
