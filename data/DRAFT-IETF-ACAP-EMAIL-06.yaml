abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It has become common for Internet mail users to have more than
    one\naccount where mail is received, to access multiple accounts from the\nsame
    machine, to access the same accounts from different machines,\nand to use multiple
    programs which require email account\nconfiguration information.\nThe Application
    Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an\nideal mechanism for storage
    of email account data.\nThis specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class
    for email\naccounts, and a common option for indicating a default email\naccount.\n\t
