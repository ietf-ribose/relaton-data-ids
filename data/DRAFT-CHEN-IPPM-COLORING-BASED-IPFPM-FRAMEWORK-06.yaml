abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a measurement method, the IP flow performance\n
    \  measurement (IPFPM).  With IPFPM, data packets are marked into\n   different
    blocks of markers by changing one or more bits of packets.\n   No additional delimiting
    packet is needed and the performance is\n   measured in-service and in-band without
    the insertion of additional\n   traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
