abstract:
  content: "<p>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on theInternet
    as a means of identifying various resources, services, anddestinations. However,
    a means of attaching a set of attributes orcharacteristics to a given resource
    identifier and subsequentlyassessing those attributes or characteristics has not
    been specifiedand deployed.Two tasks are envisioned. The first task will be to
    define a generalresolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to
    alist of attributes. The second task will be to define anadministrative model
    and update protocol that can be used to set upand maintain the information the
    resolution protocol accesses.</p>"
