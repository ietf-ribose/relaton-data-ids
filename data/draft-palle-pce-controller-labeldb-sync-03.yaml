abstract:
- content: "<p>PCE as a central controller specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol
    extensions where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label forwarding entries
    are downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along
    the LSP path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.
    Labels downloaded to forwarding entries requires a reliable synchronization mechanism
    between the path computation clients (PCCs) and the PCE. The basic mechanism for
    label database (LABEL-DB synchronization is part of the PCE as a central controller
    specification. This document presents motivations for optimizations to the LABEL-DB
    synchronization and the corresponding PCEP procedures and extensions.</p>"
