abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up\n   Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label\n   Switched Paths.  The existing
    specification for this functionality\n   assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors
    are directly connected.\n   However, the LDP base specification allows for the
    case where a pair\n   of LDP neighbors are not directly connected; the LDP session
    between\n   such a pair of neighbors is known as a \"Targeted LDP\" session.  This\n
    \  document provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP\n   extensions
    over a Targeted LDP session.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
