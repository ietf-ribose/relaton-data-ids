abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Path computation in large multi-layer and multi-region networks
    is\n   complex and may require special computational components and\n   cooperation
    between different network domains, whereby a failure\n   affect to establish a
    path or a failure of an existing path may be\n   corrected by a new path computation
    and fresh signaling.  This\n   document specifies the crank-back routing mechanism
    based on re-\n   routing in crank back Path Computation Element (PCE).  When a
    Path\n   Computation Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful\n
    \  for the PCC to specify Crank-back routing to the path computation,\n   abstract
    nodes, resources, and domains that are to be explicitly\n   excluded from the
    computed route.  Such mechanism is termed Crank-\n   back routing.  The PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a\n   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs.
    \ To support this\n   mechanism, function of PCE and procedure of PCEP signaling\n
    \  performance are extended.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
