abstract:
- content: "<p>Various Internet protocols and applications require some mechanism
    for identifying relationships between Domain Name System (DNS) names. In this
    document we provide examples of protocols and applications for which knowledge
    of these relationships is useful, if not required. Further we discuss the various
    types of domain name relationships, review current needs and solutions, and identify
    considerations for solution sets.</p>"
