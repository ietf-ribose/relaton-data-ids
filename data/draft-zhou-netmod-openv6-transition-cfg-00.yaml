abstract:
- content: "<p>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there are many kinds of transition
    methods and scenarios that have been or are currently being defined in IETF, e.g.,
    DS-Lite, Lw4over6, MAP-E, 4rd, 6rd and etc. Carriers have to select and determine
    their transition ways among all of these techniques, which brings slow transition
    to IPv6. Currently, we face two main challenges in IPv6 transition: the legacy
    equipment does not support multiple IPv6 transition technologies at the same time
    and there are not enough native IPv6 applications. This document describes an
    open IPv6 YANG [RFC6020] data model which serves as a framework for configuring
    and managing an IPv6 service to provide a low-cost and unified way to IPv6 transition.</p>"
