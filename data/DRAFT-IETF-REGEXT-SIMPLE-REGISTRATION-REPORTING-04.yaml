abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain name registries (the producer) and registrars (the consumer)\n
    \  report to each other by sharing bulk information through files.  This\n   document
    creates two IANA registries to establish a standard\n   reporting mechanism between
    domain name registries and registrars.\n   The first IANA registry lists standard
    data elements and their syntax\n   for inclusion in the files.  The second IANA
    registry lists standard\n   reports based on the standard data elements.  Each
    report is a file\n   formatted as a CSV file.  The advantage of this reporting
    mechanism\n   is that a report, each file, can be imported by recipients without\n
    \  any prior knowledge of their contents, although reporting is enhanced\n   with
    a minimum of knowledge about the files.  The mechanism for the\n   distribution
    of and access of the files is a matter of local policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
