abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In HTTP/2.0, if running over TLS, the client is the first to\n
    \  transmit HTTP/2.0 frames on the new session. With its first\n   transmission
    to the server, the client can already overrun some\n   of the server settings
    and preferences, leading to failure\n   conditions and unnecessary complexity.
    This document proposes a\n   solution to this problem based on a very small set
    of server\n   profiles for initial settings sent within the TLS handshake.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
