abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a format for encapsulating RDMA (remote direct
    memory access) information within a TCP data stream. No changes or modification
    to TCP of any sort are required. This is not intended to be a protocol, but rather
    a common format that may be shared by multiple client protocols, for instance
    VI/TCP and iSCSI. By using a common format it is hoped that design of NICs supporting
    these multiple protocols can be simplified. Sufficient information is included
    in the RDMA message format to allow determination of the protocol message units,
    as will as the ability to process an incoming RDMA request even if previous packets
    are missing and awaiting retransmission. In addition a CRC-32 is included in each
    segment to enhance the checksum coverage included in TCP.</p>"
