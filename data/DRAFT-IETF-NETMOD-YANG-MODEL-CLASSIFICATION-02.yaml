abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being\n
    \  considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the\n   networking
    industry at large.  Many standards-defining organizations\n   (SDOs), open source
    software projects, vendors and users are using\n   YANG to develop and publish
    YANG modules of configuration, state data\n   and operations for a wide variety
    of applications.  At the same time,\n   there is currently no well-known terminology
    to categorize various\n   types of YANG modules.\n\n   A consistent terminology
    would help with the categorization of YANG\n   modules, assist in the analysis
    the YANG data modeling efforts in the\n   IETF and other organizations, and bring
    clarity to the YANG-related\n   discussions between the different groups.\n\n
    \  This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to\n   support
    consistent classification of YANG modules.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
