abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Spam, defined as the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages,
    has\n   plagued Internet email.  Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.\n
    \  It can affect any system that enables user to user communications.\n   The
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user to\n   user multimedia
    communications.  Therefore, it is susceptible to\n   spam, just as email is.  In
    this document, we analyze the problem of\n   spam in SIP.  We first identify the
    ways in which the problem is the\n   same and the ways in which it is different
    from email.  We then\n   examine the various possible solutions that have been
    discussed for\n   email and consider their applicability to SIP.  Discussions
    on this\n   draft should be directed at sipping@ietf.org.\n\t </p>\n      "
