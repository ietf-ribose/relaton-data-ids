abstract:
- content: "<p>Alternate-Marking (coloring) provides a method to perform packet loss,
    delay, and jitter measurements on live traffic. At the same time, on-path telemetry
    techniques are used to enable the collection and correlation of performance information
    to further support autonomous network operations. However, network operators still
    face the challenge of inband flow identification in large scale deployment. This
    document addresses the problems by introducing the real network scenarios, and
    proposes the requirements of supporting inband flow learning of flow information
    telemetry.</p>"
