abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for extending the scope of
    the JSON\n   Web Signature (JWS) specification, called JWS/CT (JWS \"Clear Text\").\n
    \  By combining the detached mode of JWS with the JSON Canonicalization\n   Scheme
    (JCS), JWS/CT enables JSON objects to remain in the JSON\n   format after being
    signed.  In addition to supporting a consistent\n   data format, this arrangement
    also simplifies documentation,\n   debugging, and logging.  The ability to embed
    signed JSON objects in\n   other JSON objects, makes the use of counter-signatures\n
    \  straightforward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
