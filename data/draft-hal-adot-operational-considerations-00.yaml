abstract:
- content: <p>DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as a means
    of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers. There have also
    been discussions and experiments involving the use of DoT to communicate with
    authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS over TLS or "ADoT"), including communication
    between recursive and authoritative resolvers. However, we have identified a number
    of operational concerns with ADoT. These operational concerns need to be addressed
    prior to ADoT's deployment at scale by DNS operators in order to maintain the
    stability and resilience of the global DNS. The document also provides some suggested
    next steps to advance the operator community's understanding of ADoT's operational
    impact.</p>
