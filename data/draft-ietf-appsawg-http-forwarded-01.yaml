abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that allows
    proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying process, e.g., the
    originating IP address of a request or IP number of the proxy on the user-agent
    facing interface. Given a trusted path of proxying components, this makes it possible
    to arrange so that each subsequent component will have access to e.g., all IP
    addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests. This document also specifies
    guidelines for a proxy administrator to anonymize the origin of a request.</p>"
