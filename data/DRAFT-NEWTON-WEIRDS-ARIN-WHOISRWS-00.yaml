abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the RESTful Web Service for Whois data
    as\n   implemented and fielded by the American Registry for Internet Numbers\n
    \  (ARIN).  ARIN calls this service Whois-RWS.\n\n   The purpose of this document
    is to facilitate discussion and serve as\n   input into a standards process in
    this area, currently being\n   discussed on the WHOIS-based Extensible Internet
    Registration Data\n   Service (WEIRDS) mailing list\n   (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/weirds).\n\n
    \  Please excuse this very rough initial draft.  It is roughly based on\n   information
    currently published on ARIN's website.  However, future\n   revisions of this
    document are planned, including discussions on\n   lessons learned by ARIN from
    the deployment of Whois-RWS and thoughts\n   on a future, unified standard.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
