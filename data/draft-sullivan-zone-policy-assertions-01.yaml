abstract:
- content: <p>Some security policies on the Internet depend on the idea of the "domain
    policy" or "zone policy". It is difficult to discover such policies, and it is
    harder to do so in a way that does not subject operators of domains to others'
    assertions. This memo describes the problem, and proposes a mechanism for solving
    it.</p>
