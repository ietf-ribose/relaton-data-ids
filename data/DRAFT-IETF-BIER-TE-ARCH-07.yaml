abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose
    path\n   steered replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication\n
    \  packets (RFC8279).  This is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE).\n   BIER-TE
    can be used as a path steering mechanism in future Traffic\n   Engineering solutions
    for BIER (BIER-TE).\n\n   BIER-TE leverages RFC8279 and extends it with a new
    semantic for bits\n   in the bitstring.  BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding
    engines with\n   little or no changes.\n\n   In BIER, the BitPositions (BP) of
    the packets bitstring indicate BIER\n   Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER), and
    hop-by-hop forwarding uses a\n   Routing Underlay such as an IGP.\n\n   In BIER-TE,
    BitPositions indicate adjacencies.  The BIFT of each BFR\n   are only populated
    with BPs that are adjacent to the BFR in the BIER-\n   TE topology.  The BIER-TE
    topology can consist of layer 2 or remote\n   (routed) adjacencies.  The BFR then
    replicates and forwards BIER\n   packets to those adjacencies.  This results in
    the aforementioned\n   strict and loose path steering and replications.\n\n   BIER-TE
    can co-exist with BIER forwarding in the same domain, for\n   example by using
    separate BIER sub-domains.  In the absence of routed\n   adjacencies, BIER-TE
    does not require a BIER routing underlay, and\n   can then be operated without
    requiring an Interior Gateway Routing\n   protocol (IGP).\n\n   BIER-TE operates
    without explicit in-network tree-state and carries\n   the multicast distribution
    tree in the packet header.  It can\n   therefore be a good fit to support multicast
    path steering in Segment\n   Routing (SR) networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
