abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The email ecosystem has long had a very permissive set of common\n
    \  processing rules in place, despite increasingly rigid standards\n   governing
    its components, ostensibly to improve the user experience.\n   The handling of
    these come at some cost, and various components are\n   faced with decisions about
    whether or not to permit non-conforming\n   messages to continue toward their
    destinations unaltered, adjust them\n   to conform (possibly at the cost of losing
    some of the original\n   message), or outright rejecting them.\n\n   This memo
    includes a collection of the best current practices in a\n   variety of such situations,
    to be used as implementation guidance.\n   It must be emphasized, however, that
    the intent of this memo is not\n   to standardize malformations or otherwise encourage
    their\n   proliferation.  The messages that are the subject of this memo are\n
    \  manifestly malformed, and the code and culture that generates them\n   needs
    to be fixed.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from\n   otherwise legitimate
    senders are in circulation and will be for some\n   time and, unfortunately, commercial
    reality shows that we cannot\n   simply reject or discard them.  Accordingly,
    this memo presents\n   recommendations for dealing with them in ways that seem
    to do the\n   least additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to\n
    \  match the standards.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
