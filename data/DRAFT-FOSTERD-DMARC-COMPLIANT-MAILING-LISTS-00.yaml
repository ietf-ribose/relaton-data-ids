abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mailing Lists often make changes to a message before it is\n
    \  retransmitted.  This invalidates DKIM signatures, causing a DMARC\n   test
    on the RFC5322.From addres to fail.  A DMARC-compliant mailing\n   list is one
    which uses member alias addresses to identify the\n   document as sent by a specific
    author via the mechanism of the list.\n   An appropriate aliasing mechanism will
    not only prevent DMARC FAIL,\n   but will also allow messages between members,
    will look natural to\n   senders and recipients, and will allow list organization
    domains to\n   advance to p=reject.  This document describes an aliasing approach\n
    \  which meets these goals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
