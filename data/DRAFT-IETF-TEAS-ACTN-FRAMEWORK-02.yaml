abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Traffic Engineered networks have a variety of mechanisms to\n
    \  facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane.  They\n   also
    have a range of management and provisioning protocols to\n   configure and activate
    network resources.  These mechanisms\n   represent key technologies for enabling
    flexible and dynamic\n   networking.\n\n   Abstraction of network resources is
    a technique that can be applied\n   to a single network domain or across multiple
    domains to create a\n   single virtualized network that is under the control of
    a network\n   operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns\n   the
    network resources.\n\n   This document provides a framework for Abstraction and
    Control of\n   Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
