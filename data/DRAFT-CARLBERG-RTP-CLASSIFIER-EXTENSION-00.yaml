abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new RTP header extension. The purpose
    of\nthe extension is to provide an additional information that further\ndistinguishes
    the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams\ncontaining the same type
    of payload.  Specifically, a classifier\nfield is defined in the extension header
    that contains value such as\n'emergency'.  RTP compliant implementations that
    do not recognize the\nclassifier extension header must continue to process the
    packet and\nnot take no adverse action.  Criteria for inserting the values in
    the\nclassifier header, and any QoS treatment of the packet based on those\nvalues,
    is outside the scope of this specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
