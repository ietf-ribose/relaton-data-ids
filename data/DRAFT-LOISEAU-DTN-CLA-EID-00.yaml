abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a specific EID scheme namely \"cla\"
    that meets\n   the requirement for endpoint identification as defined in the Bundle\n
    \  Protocol and that also uniquely identifies a Convergence Layer\n   Adapter
    \"channel\" and is, in essence, an interface identifier (IID).\n   Such IID is
    comprised of two parts: a \"cla-identifier\" part that\n   identifies a specific
    convergence layer adapter, and a \"cla-\n   parameters\" part that is a cla-specific
    list of parameter describing\n   a single channel managed by this convergence
    layer adapter.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
