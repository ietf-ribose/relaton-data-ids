abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In contrast to other Internet services, most SIP sessions takeplace
    between individuals. Today's billing schemes (flat rate orvolume based) do not
    reflect that. A caller causes costs on thecallee's side. With SIP's authentication
    methods and few additionalheaders, a SIP billing service could be established
    that wouldenable callees to charge their callers. Call stateful proxies arenot
    required.</p>"
