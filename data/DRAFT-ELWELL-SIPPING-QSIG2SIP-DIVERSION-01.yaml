abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation
    \nProtocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks \n(also
    known as enterprise networks) for calls that undergo diversion. \nSIP is an Internet
    application-layer control (signalling) protocol \nfor creating, modifying, and
    terminating sessions with one or more\nparticipants. These sessions include, in
    particular, telephone calls. \nQSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying
    and terminating \ncircuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within
    Private \nIntegrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number
    \nof Ecma Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards. \n\t </p>\n      "
