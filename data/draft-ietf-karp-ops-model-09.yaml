abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is engaged in an effort to analyze security of routing protocol
    authentication according to design guidelines discussed in RFC 6518. Developing
    an operational and management model for routing protocol security that works with
    all the routing protocols will be critical to the deployability of these efforts.
    This document gives recommendations to operators and implementors regarding management
    and operation of router authentication. These recommendations will also assist
    protocol designers in understanding management issues they will face.</p>"
