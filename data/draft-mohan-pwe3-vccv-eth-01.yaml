abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to Virtual Circuit Connection Verification
    (VCCV) procedures to add Ethernet OAM functionality. VCCV supports connection
    verification applications for PWs regardless of the underlying public service
    network technology. This document proposes VCCV to support Ethernet OAM as an
    option to perform operations and maintenance functions; especially when the PSN
    is Ethernet.</p>"
