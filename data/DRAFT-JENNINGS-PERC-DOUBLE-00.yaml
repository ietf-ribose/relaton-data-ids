abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary\n
    \  to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing\n   strong
    end-to-end security guarantees.  This document defines a SRTP\n   procedures that
    uses two separate but related cryptographic contexts\n   to provide \"hop by hop\"
    and \"end to end\" security guarantees.  Both\n   the end-to-end and hop-by-hop
    cryptographic transforms can utilizes\n   an authenticated encryption with associated
    data scheme or take\n   advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.
    \ SRTCP\n   is encrypted hop-by-hop using an already-defined SRTCP cryptographic\n
    \  transform.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
