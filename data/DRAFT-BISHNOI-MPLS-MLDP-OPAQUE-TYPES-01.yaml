abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[MLDP] describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) \nfor setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint
    \n(MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). LDP forwarding equivalence class \n(FEC)
    elements used to establish P2MP and MP2MP LSPs include type-\nlength-value (TLV)
    fields that carry information meaningful to \nIngress LSRs and Leaf LSRs and are
    termed as Opaque Value Elements in \n[MLDP]. This document defines Opaque Value
    Element structure to be \nused for provisioning P2MP and MP2MP Provider tunnels
    (P-Tunnels) for \nMulticast Virtual Private Network (MVPN). It is envisioned that
    this \nwould be useful for security and manageability of P-Tunnels used for \nMVPN
    from the ones provisioned for other applications and vice-versa.\n\t </p>\n      "
