abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft we discuss the attributes and characteristics of an Internet
    architecture based on assigning unique identifiers to all physical devices, users,
    services, and agents. A supporting location-finding mechanism is also defined.
    The advantages of such as architecture are presented. Please note: this discussion
    is still in the preliminary stages and should be considered as such.</p>"
