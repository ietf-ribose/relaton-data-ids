abstract:
  content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCP
    servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers configuration flexibility.
    If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly fake attack.
    This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv6 and specifies security mechanisms,
    mainly using CGAs.</p>"
