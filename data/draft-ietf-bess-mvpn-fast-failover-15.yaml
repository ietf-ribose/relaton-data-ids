abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN) extensions
    and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream failures by allowing downstream
    Provider Edges (PEs) to consider the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when
    selecting the Upstream PE for a VPN multicast flow. The fast failover is enabled
    by using "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks" (RFC
    8562) and the new BGP Attribute, BFD Discriminator. Also, this document introduces
    a new BGP Community, Standby PE, extending BGP Multicast VPN (MVPN) routing so
    that a C-multicast route can be advertised toward a Standby Upstream PE.</p>
