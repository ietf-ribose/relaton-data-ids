abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means
    of\n   attesting the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in\n   order
    to prevent impersonation of a calling party number, which is a\n   key enabler
    for illegal robocalling.  Similar impersonation is\n   leveraged by bad actors
    in the text messaging space.  This document\n   considers the applicability of
    STIR's Persona Assertion Token\n   (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework
    to instant text and\n   multimedia messaging use cases, both for messages carried
    or\n   negotiated by SIP, and for non-SIP messaging.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
