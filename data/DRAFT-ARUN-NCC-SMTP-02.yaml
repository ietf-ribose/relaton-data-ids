abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft presents a mechanism to simplify one of the cumbersome
    \naspects of mailing, when one needs to send mails only to a subset of \nmail-ids
    from an alias [ALIAS] . The basic intention is only to minimize \nthe complication
    and difficulty of a mail user when a mail needs to be \nsent to n - m mail IDs
    i.e. send it to a group Id of n and exclude m\nfrom the alias [ALIAS] list.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
