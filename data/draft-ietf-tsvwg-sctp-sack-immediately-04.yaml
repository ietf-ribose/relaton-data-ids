abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 4960 by defining a method for the sender
    of a DATA chunk to indicate that the corresponding Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)
    chunk should be sent back immediately and should not be delayed. It is done by
    specifying a bit in the DATA chunk header, called the (I)mmediate bit, which can
    get set by either the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation
    or the application using an SCTP stack. Since unknown flags in chunk headers are
    ignored by SCTP implementations, this extension does not introduce any interoperability
    problems.</p>"
