abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is proposed to use version 2 of the Internet
    Key \n   Exchange (IKEv2) to replace current HIP protocol's base exchange. \n
    \  IKE-H is an extension of IKE used for performing mutual \n   authentication,
    establishing and maintaining security associations. \n   It provides continuity
    of communications between not only hosts but \n   also security gateways. It supports
    HIP identity authentication \n   method and the establishment of keying material,
    consequently being \n   used by IPsec Encapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish
    a two-\n   way secure communication channel between the hosts or security \n   gateways.
    \ \n\t </p>\n      "
