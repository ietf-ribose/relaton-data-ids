abstract:
  content: "<p>The ASCII-text file format of Request for Comments (RFC) documentswas
    devised decades ago when the authoring tools were line editorslike vi and text
    processors like nroff. The format still has greatutility because it meets the
    constraints of many kinds of printingand display equipment, but it is difficult
    to produce with some oftoday's desktop publishing tools. This paper describes
    the RFC textfile format and discusses its fine points; this should be useful toauthors
    of RFCs and Internet Drafts regardless of their tools. Thispaper also describes
    the UGLI method, a hybrid method for producingRFCs by using modern software for
    composition and editing and usingolder software, applied in 'cookbook' fashion,
    to finish the job. Themethod is described in terms of Microsoft Word on an Apple
    Macintoshbut is easily adaptable for other word processors on other platforms.</p>"
