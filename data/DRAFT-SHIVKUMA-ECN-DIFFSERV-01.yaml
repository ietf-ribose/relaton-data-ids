abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes the use of one bit in the DS-byte to\n
    \  facilitate ECN-type control in the differentiated services\n   architecture.
    Specifically during periods of congestion along a\n   flow's path (indicated using
    the one-bit mechanism), the out-of-\n   profile packets of the flow (packets for
    which the 'In profile' bit\n   is cleared) can be either delayed or dropped by
    the ingress network\n   edge routers. This scheme would allow interior routers
    to preserve\n   their resources for processing in-profile packets during congestion\n
    \  and guard against certain types of denial-of-service attacks. The\n   proposed
    mechanism could also be used to build differentiated\n   services networks with
    lower average delay, and aid the\n   implementation of congestion-based pricing
    schemes in such\n   architectures. The mechanism interoperates well with the baseline\n
    \  differentiated services architecture and can also interoperate with\n   ECN-TCP
    and future ECN-enabled transports/applications. Further, the\n   ECN-type flow
    control can be deployed within a differentiated\n   services network even if end-to-end
    ECN support is unavailable,\n   allowing a quick migration path.\n\t </p>\n      "
