abstract:
- content: "<p>The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out
    by various people or entities. The RFC Editor model described in this document
    divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: The RFC
    Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher. The Internet
    Architecture Board (IAB) oversight by way of delegation to the RFC Series Oversight
    Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF Administrative
    Oversight Committee (IAOC) and the RSOC. This document reflects the experience
    gained with RFC Editor Model version 1, documented in [RFC5620] and obsoletes
    that document.</p>"
