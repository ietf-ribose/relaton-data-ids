abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of
    objects\n   to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n
    \  different domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\"
    of protocols to enable a horizontally unified IoT\n   architecture.  The objective
    of such an architecture is to make\n   resource objects securely accessible to
    applications across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a
    few proposals\n   have been made to build an application-layer based unified IoT\n
    \  platform on top of today's host-centric Internet.  However, there is\n   a
    fundamental mismatch between the host-centric nature of today's\n   Internet and
    mostly information-centric nature of the IoT system.  To\n   address this mismatch
    the common set of protocols and network\n   services offered by an information-centric
    network (ICN) architecture\n   can be leveraged to realize ICN-IoT architectures.
    \ These ICN-IoT\n   solutions leverages the salient features of ICN, and taking
    advantage\n   of naming, security, mobility and efficient content and service\n
    \  delivery support.\n\n   This draft summarizes general IoT demands, and covers
    the challenges\n   and design to realize ICN-IoT frameworks based on ICN architecture.\n\n
    \  Beyond this, the goal of this draft is not to offer any specific ICN-\n   IoT
    architectural proposals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
