abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking
    (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about potential experimental
    setups where different approaches can be tested and compared against each other.
    All scenarios included in this document are based on published literature. That
    is, they have all been considered in one or more performance evaluation studies,
    which are already available to the community. The scenarios selected aim to exercise
    a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address. They include a) general
    aspects, such as, network efficiency, mobility support, multicast and caching
    performance, real-time communication efficacy, disruption and delay tolerance;
    and b) ICN-specific aspects, such as, information security and trust, persistence,
    availability, provenance, and location independence.</p>"
