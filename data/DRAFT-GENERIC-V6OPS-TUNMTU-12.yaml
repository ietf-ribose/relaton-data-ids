abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-in-IP tunnels
    is\n   currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length of\n
    \  the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.\n   This requires
    the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet\n   larger than the MTU or
    drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too\n   Big (PTB) message.  Concerns
    for operational issues with Path MTU\n   Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility
    of MTU-related black holes\n   when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.
    \ The current\n   \"Internet cell size\" is effectively 1500 bytes (i.e., the
    minimum MTU\n   configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet) and
    should\n   therefore also be the minimum MTU assigned to tunnels, but this has\n
    \  proven to be problematic in common operational practice.  This\n   document
    therefore discusses operational considerations for tunnel\n   fragmentation and
    reassembly necessary to accommodate this Internet\n   cell size.\n\n\t </p>\n
