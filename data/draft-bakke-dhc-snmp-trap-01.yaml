abstract:
  content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC1531] provides a methodfor
    a host to retrieve common configuration parameters at boot time.These include
    the host's IP address, default gateway, subnet mask,DNS server, and other useful
    things.When a host is booted from the network, it does not have access tothese
    configuration parameters from its local or network disk rightaway; it relies instead
    on DHCP to provide them. One such parameterthat is not yet provided is a list
    of IP hosts to which to send SNMPnotifications [RFC1448] during the boot process,
    particularly if theboot fails. As the host is already gleaning similar information
    fromDHCP, a new option to specify these SNMP 'trap' hosts appears to bethe simplest
    method to gain this information. Hosts not booting fromthe network benefit as
    well, since SNMP notification hosts can now beconfigured centrally through DHCP.This
    document describes a proposed DHCP option that specifies a listof SNMP notification
    hosts to which SNMP notifications should besent.</p>"
