abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a framework, i.e., an application
    layer\n   based lifetime [applicationiid] to enable applications maintaining\n
    \  their users' privacy as well as controlling the number of Interface\n   IDs
    (IIDs) per network adapter. It will also explain different\n   approaches that
    can be used for maintaining the lifetime of an IID.\n   We also compare this framework
    to the other available mechanisms.\n   This document also explains when to remove
    deprecated IP addresses\n   from the a network interface.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
