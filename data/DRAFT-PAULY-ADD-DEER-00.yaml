abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines Discovery of Equivalent Encrypted Resolvers\n
    \  (DEER), a mechanism for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a\n   resolver's
    encrypted DNS configuration.  This mechanism can be used\n   to move from unencrypted
    DNS to encrypted DNS when only the IP\n   address of an encrypted resolver is
    known.  It can also be used to\n   discover support for encrypted DNS protocols
    when the name of an\n   encrypted resolver is known.  This mechanism is designed
    to be\n   limited to cases where equivalent encrypted and unencrypted resolvers\n
    \  are operated by the same entity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
