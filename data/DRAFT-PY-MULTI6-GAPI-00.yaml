abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document establishes an address allocation framework for
    \nGeographically Aggregatable Provider Independent (GAPI) IPv6 addresses\nfor
    the purpose of multihoming. A /16 is divided in a hierarchical \nmanner over geographical
    entities such as parts of continents, \ncountries, states, provinces and metropolitan
    areas, with each \nreceiving one or more /32 allocations from which end-user assignments
    \ncan be made. The number of /32 allocations for a geographical entity \ndepends
    on the current population. This address allocation framework\nin itself does not
    present a scalable multihoming solution, it merely\nprovides a necessary building
    block for such solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
