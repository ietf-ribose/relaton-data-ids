abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the SDN, the controller is in charge of the maintenance
    and\n   administration of variable aspects like the network topology and the\n
    \  network resources etc. of the whole network.  Administrative\n   strategies
    are made upon these work and sent to the switches from the\n   controller so as
    to instruct the network devices to apply appropriate\n   policies to the data
    flows.  As for the data packet which reaches the\n   ingress OpenFlow switch for
    the first time, the packet itself or a\n   fraction of the packet will be encapsulated
    into a packet-in message\n   and will be sent to the controller to request for
    a new flow rule.\n   After the flow-mod message and the packet-out message are
    sent back\n   to the switch from the controller, the determined forwarding action\n
    \  will be applied to the certain data flow.\n\n   So far, the inbound latency
    caused by the creation of the packet-in\n   message and the outbound latency caused
    by the receive and the\n   execution of the flow-mod message are highlighted when
    it comes to\n   the concerns about the latency and the effectiveness of the data\n
    \  transportation in the SDN[Mazu].  Attention to the studies on the\n   processing
    order of the flow rule request message like the packet-in\n   message and the
    packet-out message is comparatively low.  As the SDN\n   continually grows in
    scale and complexity and the packets' forwarding\n   policies become more recursive
    and dynamic, the number of the\n   switches under the administration of the same
    controller is elevated\n   and unavoidably causes the network congestion problem
    widespread.\n   The scale of modern networks and data-centers and the associated\n
    \  operational expense deteriorates the delay problem in the network\n   with
    congestion.  The ability to help the services with high priority\n   be processed
    without delay becomes critical.\n\n   This document proposes the combination of
    appending a priority tag to\n   the packet-in message and the Priority based Flow
    Rule Request\n   Message Processing Mechanism(PFRRMPM) as a solution to help the
    data\n   flow with high priority or lantency-sensitive to acquire the\n   forwarding
    rule without or with shorter waiting latency when there\n   are excess flow rule
    request messages in the SDN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
