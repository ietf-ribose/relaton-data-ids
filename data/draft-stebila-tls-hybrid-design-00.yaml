abstract:
- content: "<p>Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms
    simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing security even
    if all but one of the component algorithms is broken, and is motivated by transition
    to post-quantum cryptography. This document categorizes various design considerations
    for using hybrid key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version
    1.3.</p>"
