abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework
    also\n   known under the PMF methodology.  The methodology is based on the\n   manifesto
    written by Zed A.  Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which\n   describes a natural
    approach to software engineering with a strong\n   focus on the act of programming.
    \ The PMF methodology uses a soft\n   naming to allow for a non-partisan reference
    to official engineering\n   or project documents describing one of the most used
    software\n   engineering methodologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
