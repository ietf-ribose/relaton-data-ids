abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Beginning in December 1991, a \"Request for Comments Summary\"
    was\n   published every 100 RFCs.  RFC numbers ending with 99 were reserved\n
    \  for these summary documents.  This document retires the publication\n   of
    the RFC summary documents.  Moving forward, RFC numbers ending in\n   99 will
    be assigned to RFCs-to-be.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
