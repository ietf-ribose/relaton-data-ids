abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic Policy Controllers like resource and admission control systems
    need to be able to locate media receivers in each segment of the network to determine
    the path of the media flows prior to allowing or rejecting the session setup.
    This is fine as long as this is handled within an operator's network but limited
    when extending this to home network. Current definitions of SDP are not clear
    about conveying a local identifier (e.g., a private IP address) of the client
    that is destined to receive media streams after successful SDP negotiation. In
    this draft we outline the need for carrying such information over SDP and discuss
    a set of possible solutions in a scenario with a home network and a operator network
    domain.</p>"
