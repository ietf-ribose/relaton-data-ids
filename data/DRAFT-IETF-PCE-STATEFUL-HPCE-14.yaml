abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information
    on\n   the current network state received from the Path Computation Clients\n
    \  (PCCs), including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved\n   resources
    within the network, and pending path computation requests.\n   This information
    may then be considered when computing the path for a\n   new traffic-engineered
    LSP or for any associated/dependent LSPs. The\n   Path computation response from
    a PCE is helpful for the PCC to\n   gracefully establish the computed LSP.\n\n
    \  The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture\n   provides
    an architecture to allow the optimum sequence of\n   inter-connected domains to
    be selected, and network policy to be\n   applied if applicable, via the use of
    a hierarchical relationship\n   between PCEs.\n\n   Combining the capabilities
    of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE\n   would be advantageous. This document
    describes general considerations\n   and use cases for the deployment of Stateful,
    and not Stateless, PCEs\n   using the Hierarchical PCE architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n
