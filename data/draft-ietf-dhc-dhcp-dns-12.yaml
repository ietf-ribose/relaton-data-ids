abstract:
  content: "<p>DHCP provides a powerful mechanism for IP host configuration.However,
    the configuration capability provided by DHCP does notinclude updating DNS, and
    specifically updating the name to addressand address to name mappings maintained
    in the DNS.This document specifies how DHCP clients and servers should use theDynamic
    DNS Updates mechanism in [RFC2136] to update the DNS name toaddress and address
    to name mappings so that the mappings for DHCPclients will be consistent with
    the IP addresses that the clientsacquire via DHCP.</p>"
