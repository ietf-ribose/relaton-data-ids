abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer
    mode\ncapability.  Therefore it is quite natural that there appears\nfollowing
    demands.  (1)Transmit specific IP flow through a certain\nisochronous channel
    of IEEE1394 bus.  (2)Transmit specific AV flow\n(such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883])
    through a certain\nisochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows
    by IP\napplications).  To realize these, this draft proposes the protocol\nwith
    following features.  (1)Notify the relation between channel ID\nand IP flow.  (2)Notify
    the bandwidth of the isochronous\nchannel. (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow
    transmitted through\nthe channel.  (4)Notify the attribute of the flow. This protocol
    is\ndefined as the extension of MCAP (Multicast Channel Allocation\nProtocol).\n\n\t
