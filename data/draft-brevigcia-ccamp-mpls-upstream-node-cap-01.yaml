abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to [TE-NODE-CAP] in order tosupport
    additional TE node capabilities in the context of Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP
    routing and fast reroute protection. As forpoint-to-point LSP, nesting P2MP LSPs,
    i.e., MPLS P2MP hierarchy, isa desirable traffic-engineering feature. However,
    nesting P2MP LSPsrequires a mechanism to coordinate the label allocation of the
    innerP2MP LSP between the egress nodes of the P2MP Tunnel as described in[MPLS-UPSTREAM].
    To solve this issue, a new label allocation schemecalled Upstream Label Assignment
    (ULA) is defined. Network elementsresponsible for the route computation of P2MP
    LSP should be aware ofthe nodes that support this functionality. For that purpose,
    wedefine a new bit flag to the TE Node Capability Descriptor as definedin [TE-NODE-CAP].
    The bit flag (U) enables a node to advertise itscapability to accept Upstream
    Label Assignment.</p>"
