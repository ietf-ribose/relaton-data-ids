abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism\n
    \  designed for incremental deployment.  They provide limited protection\n   to
    DNS servers and resolvers against a variety of increasingly common\n   denial-of-service
    and amplification/forgery or cache poisoning\n   attacks by off-path attackers.
    DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT-\n   PT, and anycast.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
