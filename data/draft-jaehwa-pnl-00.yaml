abstract:
  content: "\t <t>An important challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is that
    howto route data packets from sources to base station energy efficiently.Inspiring
    data fusion feature and multi-hop routing, in this document,we introduce a clustering
    approach called PLIR (Prolonging NetworkLifetime via Intra-Cluster Routing) for
    saving energy anddistributing data dissipation evenly by improving BS cluster
    formationalgorithm of LEACH-Centralized and providing 3-hop routing algorithmwithin
    clusters. Hence, it prolongs the lifetime of WSN. PLIR consumesless energy and
    reduces communication overhead, and extends thenetwork lifetime compared with
    other approaches.</p>"
