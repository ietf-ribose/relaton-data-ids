abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a source address validation solution
    for\n   WLANs where 802.11i or other security mechanisms are enabled to\n   secure
    MAC addresses.  This mechanism snoops NDP and DHCP packets to\n   bind IP addresses
    to MAC addresses, and relies on the security of MAC\n   addresses guaranteed by
    802.11i or other mechanisms to filter IP\n   spoofing packets.  It can work in
    the special situations described in\n   the charter of SAVI (Source Address Validation
    Improvements)\n   workgroup, such as multiple MAC addresses on one interface.
    \ This\n   document describes three different deployment scenarios, with\n   solutions
    for migration of binding entries when hosts move from one\n   access point to
    another.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
