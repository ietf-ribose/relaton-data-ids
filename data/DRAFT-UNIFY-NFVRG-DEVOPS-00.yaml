abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The introduction of virtualization technologies, starting from
    the\n   physical layer and going all the way up to the application plane, is\n
    \  transforming the telecom network infrastructure onto an agile, model-\n   driven
    production environment for communication services. Carrier-\n   grade network
    management was optimized for environments built with\n   monolithic physical nodes
    and involves significant deployment,\n   integration and maintenance efforts from
    network service providers.\n   The DevOps movement in the data center is a source
    of inspiration\n   regarding how to simplify and automate management processes
    for\n   software-defined infrastructure. This first version of this draft\n   identifies
    three areas that we consider key to applying DevOps\n   principles in a telecom
    service provider environment, namely for\n   monitoring, verification and troubleshooting
    processes. Finally, we\n   introduce challenges associated with operationalizing
    DevOps\n   principles at scale in software-defined telecom networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
