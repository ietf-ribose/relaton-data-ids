abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint\n
    \  Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced features\n   among
    which their multi-homing capabilities.  These solutions\n   introduce Single-Active
    and All-Active for an Ethernet Segment (ES),\n   itself defined as a set of physical
    links between the multi-homed\n   device/network and a set of PE devices that
    they are connected to.\n   This document extends the Ethernet Segment concept
    so that an ES can\n   be associated to a set of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects
    such as\n   MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs), referred to as\n
    \  Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES).  This draft describes the\n   requirements
    and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and\n   PBB-EVPN.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
