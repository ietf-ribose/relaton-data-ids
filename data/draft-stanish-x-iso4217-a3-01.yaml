abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of identifiers
    for currencies or currency-like commodities lying outside the traditional scope
    of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alpha-3 standard,
    such as digital currencies and commodities, currencies issued by countries (nation-
    states) with limited international recognition, emerging commodities such as emissions
    reduction credits, private or commercial currencies, and accounting units for
    local exchange and trading systems (LETS). Such codes are already in use; the
    registry simply codifies their existence. This document obsoletes draft-stanish-x-
    iso4217-a3-00.</p>"
