abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The OSPF specification requires that intra-area paths are always\n
    \  preferred over inter-area paths, regardless of the path's cost. \n   In some
    situations this can lead to an inefficient usage of \n   network resources. This
    document describes a solution that helps \n   to address this problem by creating
    adjacencies through backbone \n   area that belong to non-backbone areas.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
