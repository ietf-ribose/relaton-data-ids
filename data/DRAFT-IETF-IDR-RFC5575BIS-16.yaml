abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used\n   to
    distribute traffic Flow Specifications.  This allows the routing\n   system to
    propagate information regarding more specific components of\n   the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix.\n\n   It specifies IPv4 traffic Flow Specifications
    via a BGP NLRI which\n   carries traffic Flow Specification filter, and an Extended
    community\n   value which encodes actions a routing system can take if the packet\n
    \  matches the traffic flow filters.  The flow filters and the actions\n   are
    processed in a fixed order.  Other drafts specify IPv6, MPLS\n   addresses, L2VPN
    addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses.\n\n   This document obsoletes
    RFC5575 and RFC7674 to correct unclear\n   specifications in the flow filters.\n\n
    \  Applications which use the bgp Flow Specification are: 1) application\n   which
    automate inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such\n   as what is required
    in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-\n   service attacks; 2) applications
    which control traffic filtering in\n   the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service,
    and 3) applications with\n   centralized control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context.
    \ Some\n   deployments of these three applications can be handled by the strict\n
    \  ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic flow filters, and the strict actions\n   encoded
    in the extended community Flow Specification actions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
