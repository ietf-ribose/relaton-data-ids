abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an address configuration mechanism based on
    the concept of address pool allocation in the connected MANET. The Internet gateway
    acts as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server and assigns not a
    single address but a part of its address pool to an address requesting node and,
    then, the node can assign a part of its own address pool to its neighbor nodes.
    By doing this, the address allocation procedure can be expedited.</p>"
