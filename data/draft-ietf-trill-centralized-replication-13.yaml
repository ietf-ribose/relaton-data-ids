abstract:
- content: "<p>In Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) active-active
    access, a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check failure issue may occur when using
    the pseudo-nickname mechanism specified in RFC 7781. This document describes a
    solution to resolve this RPF check failure issue through centralized replication.
    All ingress Routing Bridges (RBridges) send Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast
    (BUM) traffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation. When the
    centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets and forwards
    them to their destination RBridges using a distribution tree established per the
    TRILL base protocol (RFC 6325). To avoid RPF check failure on an RBridge sitting
    between the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change
    in the RPF calculation algorithm is required. RPF checks on each RBridge MUST
    be calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress RBridge, instead of being
    calculated using the actual ingress RBridge. This document updates RFC 6325.</p>"
