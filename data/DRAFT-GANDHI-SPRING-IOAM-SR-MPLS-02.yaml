abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    records\n   operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the\n
    \  packet traverses a path between two nodes in the network.  Segment\n   Routing
    (SR) technology leverages the source routing paradigm.  This\n   document defines
    how IOAM data fields are transported with the\n   Segment Routing with MPLS data
    plane (SR-MPLS) encapsulation.  The\n   procedures defined are also equally applicable
    to all other MPLS data\n   plane encapsulations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
