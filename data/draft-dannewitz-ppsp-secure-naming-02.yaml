abstract:
  content: "<p>Today, each application typically uses its own way to identify data.The
    lack of a common naming scheme prevents applications frombenefiting from available
    copies of the same data distributed viadifferent P2P and CDN systems. The main
    proposal presented in thisdraft is idea that there should be a secure and applicationindependent
    way of naming information objects that are transportedover the Internet. The draft
    defines a set of requirements for sucha naming structure. It also presents a proposal
    for such a namingstructure that could relevant for a number of work groups (existingand
    potential), e.g. PPSP, DECADE and CDNI. In addition, today'sP2P naming schemes
    lack important security aspects that would allowthe user to check the data integrity
    and build trust in data and datapublishers. This is especially important in P2P
    applications as datais received from untrusted peers. Providing a generic naming
    schemefor P2P systems so that multiple P2P systems can use the same dataregardless
    of data location and P2P system increases the efficiencyand data availability
    of the overall data dissemination process. Thesecure naming scheme is providing
    self-certification such that thereceiver can verify the data integrity, i.e.,
    that the correct datahas been received, without requiring a trusted third party.
    It alsoenables owner authentication to build up trust in (potentiallyanonymous)
    data publishers. The secure naming structure should bebeneficial as potential
    design principle in defining the twoprotocols identified as objectives in the
    PPSP charter. Thisdocument enumerates a number of design considerations to impact
    thedesign and implementation of the tracker-peer signaling and peer-peerstreaming
    signaling protocols.</p>"
