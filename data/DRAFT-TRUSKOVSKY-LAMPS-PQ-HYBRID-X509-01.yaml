abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method of embedding alternative sets
    of\n   cryptographic materials into X.509v3 digital certificates, X.509v2\n   Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs), and PKCS #10 Certificate Signing\n   Requests (CSRs).
    \ The embedded alternative cryptographic materials\n   allow a Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) to use multiple cryptographic\n   algorithms in a single object, and allow
    it to transition to the new\n   cryptographic algorithms while maintaining backwards
    compatibility\n   with systems using the existing algorithms.  Three X.509 extensions\n
    \  and three PKCS #10 attributes are defined, and the signing and\n   verification
    procedures for the alternative cryptographic material\n   contained in the extensions
    and attributes are detailed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
