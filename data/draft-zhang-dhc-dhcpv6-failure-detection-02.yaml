abstract:
- content: "<p>In DHCPv6 failover or other multiple servers deployment scenarios,
    an automatic failure detection capability may be desirable. This document describes
    a detection method, with which the secondary server can detect the link failure
    between the primary server and clients. This document does not define any protocol
    details.</p>"
