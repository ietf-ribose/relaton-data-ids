abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems
    or\n   advertisement boards often have multiple audio and video streams that\n
    \  are organized to be rendered side by side or in a grid.  This\n   specification
    uses the RFC 5888 Grouping Framework to define new\n   semantics for grouping
    the media streams to be rendered side by side\n   or in a grid and indicating
    their relative ordering.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
