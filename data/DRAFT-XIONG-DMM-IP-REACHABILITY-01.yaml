abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile
    node\n   (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address\n
    \  to communicate with different hosts.\n\n   When a new correspondent node (CN)
    initials an IP session with MN,\n   the CN needs to find and select one of the
    MN's IP addresses to\n   provide best performance (e.g. with low delay) for the
    IP session.\n\n   This draft analyses the existing mechanisms for IP reachability
    in a\n   distributed mobility management environment, and identifies the key\n
    \  procedures or enhancements to support the routing-optimized IP\n   reachability
    in a distributed mobility management environment.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
