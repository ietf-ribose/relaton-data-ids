abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in theInternet
    to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions andexchange capabilities.
    Having originally been designed for sessionannouncements only, as opposed to announcements
    and capabilitiesnegotiation announcements, native SDP lacks numerous features
    to beapplicable in many session scenarios. Numerous extensions have beendeveloped
    to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have alsorepeatedly shown its inherent
    limitations. A successor protocol --termed 'SDPng' for the time being -- is developed
    to address theaforementioned needs of Internet applications in a more structuredmanner.
    With the huge installed base of SDP-based applications, amigration path needs
    to be developed to move from SDP to SDPng overtime. This document outlines how
    this migration can be achieved: ingeneral as well as for the various IETF control
    protocols thatpotentially make use of SDP and SDPng.</p>"
