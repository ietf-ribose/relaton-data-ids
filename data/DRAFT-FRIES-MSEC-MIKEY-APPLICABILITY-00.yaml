abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multimedia Internet Keying - MIKEY - is a key management scheme
    that\ncan be used for real-time applications.  In particular, it has been\ndefined
    focusing on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport\nProtocol.  MIKEY itself
    defines four key distribution schemes.\nMoreover, it is defined to allow extensions
    of the protocol.  As\nMIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the
    base protocol\narose, especially in terms of additional key distribution schemes,\nbut
    also in terms of payload enhancements.\n\n   This document provides an overview
    about MIKEY in general as well as\n   the existing extensions in MIKEY, which
    have been defined or are in\n   the process of definition.\n\t </p>\n      "
