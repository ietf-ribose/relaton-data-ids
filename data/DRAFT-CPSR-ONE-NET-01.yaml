abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents a suggested set of basic principles\n            that
    the authors believe should underlie all future work in\n            the area of
    Internet governance.  The purpose of this\n            document is to work towards
    as broad a consensus as\n            possible, in the diverse Internet community,
    about\n            principles that should inform the way the Internet is\n            administered
    for the benefit of all humanity.\n\n            The principles have been drafted
    under the auspices of\n            Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
    with\n            several iterations internal to that organization.  However,\n
    \           they are still very much seen as a work in progress.\n            Comments
    are solicited from all interested parties.  Future\n            versions will
    be refined based on these comments and\n            published as future Internet-Drafts,
    with a goal of\n            publication of a finalized version of the declaration
    as an\n            Internet RFC in summer, 1998.\n\n            All comments on
    this document are welcome; please send them\n            to onenet-comments@cpsr.org.
    \ Open discussion of this\n            document is encouraged on the onenet-discuss
    list, which is\n            archived at http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/onenet-\n
    \           discuss.\n\t </p>\n      "
