abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses architectural issues related to the extensibility
    of Internet protocols, with a focus on design considerations. It is intended to
    assist designers of both base protocols and extensions. Case studies are included.
    A companion document, RFC 4775 (BCP 125), discusses procedures relating to the
    extensibility of IETF protocols. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
