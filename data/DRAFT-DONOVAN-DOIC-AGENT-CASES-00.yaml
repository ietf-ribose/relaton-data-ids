abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution\n
    \  describes a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter\n   Overload
    among Diameter nodes.  A DOIC node is a Diameter node that\n   acts as either
    a reporting node are a reacting node.  A reporting\n   node originates overload
    reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce\n   the amount of traffic sent.  DOIC
    allows Diameter agents to act as\n   reporting nodes, reacting nodes, or both,
    but does not describe agent\n   behavior.  This document explores several use
    cases for agents to\n   participate in overload control, and makes recommendations
    for\n   certain agent behaviors to be added to DOIC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
