abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document explores how layer-3 mobility can be provided to
    mobile\nnodes that are subjects to and affected by the transition mechanisms\nspecified
    by the NGTRANS Working Group. It points out that the\ncombination of mobility
    and transition mechanisms might lead to\nproblems that will require a solution,
    and suggests requirements that\na solution should meet.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
