abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently there has been widespread interest in using Hypertext Transport
    Protocol (HTTP) as a substrate for other applications-level protocols. This document
    relates current IESG and IAB thinking on technical particulars of such use, including
    use of default ports, URL schemes, and HTTP security mechanisms. This thinking
    is subject to change as discussion continues and more experience is gained with
    such use.</p>"
