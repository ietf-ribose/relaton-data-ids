abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the procedures and recommendations
    for\n   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Provider Edges (PEs) to facilitate\n
    \  replication of multicast traffic to only certain ports (behind which\n   there
    are interested Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routers\n   and/or Internet
    Group Management Protocol (IGMP) hosts) via Protocol\n   Independent Multicast
    (PIM) snooping and proxying.\n\n   With PIM snooping, PEs passively listen to
    certain PIM control\n   messages to build control and forwarding states while
    transparently\n   flooding those messages.  With PIM proxying, Provider Edges
    (PEs) do\n   not flood PIM Join/Prune messages but only generate their own and\n
    \  send out of certain ports, based on the control states built from\n   downstream
    Join/Prune messages.  PIM proxying is required when PIM\n   Join suppression is
    enabled on the Customer Equipment (CE) devices\n   and useful to reduce PIM control
    traffic in a VPLS domain.\n\n   The document also describes PIM relay, which can
    be viewed as light-\n   weight proxying, where all downstream Join/Prune messages
    are simply\n   forwarded out of certain ports but not flooded to avoid triggering\n
    \  PIM Join suppression on CE devices.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
