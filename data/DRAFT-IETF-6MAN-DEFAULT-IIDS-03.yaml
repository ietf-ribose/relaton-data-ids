abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines Modified EUI-64 format\n
    \  Interface Identifiers, and the existing IPv6 over various link-layers\n   specify
    how such identifiers are derived from the underlying link-\n   layer address (e.g.,
    an IEEE LAN MAC address) when employing IPv6\n   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    (SLAAC).  The security and\n   privacy implications of embedding link-layer addresses
    in the\n   Interface Identifier have been known and understood for some time\n
    \  now, and some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from\n   such
    schemes to mitigate these issues.  This document changes the\n   recommended default
    Interface Identifier generation scheme for SLAAC\n   to that specified in RFC7217,
    and recommends against embedding link-\n   layer addresses in IPv6 Interface Identifiers.
    \ It formally updates\n   RFC2464, RFC2467, RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497,
    RFC2590,\n   RFC3146, RFC3572, RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC4944, RFC5072, and\n
    \  RFC5121, which require IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be derived from\n   the
    underlying link-layer address.  Additionally, this document\n   provides advice
    about the generation of Interface Identifiers with\n   other address configuration
    mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6)
    and manual configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
