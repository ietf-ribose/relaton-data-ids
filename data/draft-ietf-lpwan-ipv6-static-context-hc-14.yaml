abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
    framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation functionalities.
    SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). SCHC compression
    is based on a common static context stored in both the LPWAN devices and the network
    side. This document defines a header compression mechanism and its application
    to compress IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation and
    reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the
    LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC
    compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the layer
    two maximum payload size. The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms
    are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. Note
    that this document defines generic functionalities and advisedly offers flexibility
    with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. Such settings and choices
    are expected to be made in other technology-specific documents.</p>"
