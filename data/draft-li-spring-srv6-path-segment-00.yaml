abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".
    Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well
    as an IPv6 data plane. Further, Path Segment has been defined to identify an SR
    path in SR- MPLS networks, and used for various use-cases such as end-to-end SR
    Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM) of an SR path. Similar to SR-MPLS,
    this document defines Path Segment in SRv6 networks to identify an SRv6 path.</p>
