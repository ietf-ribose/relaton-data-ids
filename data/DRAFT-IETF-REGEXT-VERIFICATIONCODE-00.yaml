abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP)\n   extension for including a verification code for marking the data for\n
    \  a transform command as being verified by a 3rd party, which is\n   referred
    to as the Verification Service Provider (VSP).  The\n   verification code is digitally
    signed by the VSP using XML Signature\n   and is \"base64\" encoded.  The XML
    Signature includes the VSP signer\n   certificate, so the server can verify that
    the verification code\n   originated from the VSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
