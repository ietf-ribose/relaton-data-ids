abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While there is substantial community interest in next-generationmultipath-capable
    Internet transports, evolutionary pressures havegradually eroded the simplicity
    of the Internet's original transportarchitecture to a point where it is no longer
    realisticallyapplicable to new tranports. This document proposes a newarchitectural
    framework for next-generation multipath-capabletransport protocols, focusing immediately
    on multipath TCP but takingcare to allow for generalization to other multipath-capabletransports.
    The architecture places emphasis on enabling newmultipath features in a safe,
    TCP-friendly, and backward-compatiblefashion, retaining full interoperability
    with both existingapplications and existing network infrastructure, and enabling
    reuseof existing protocols as much as possible while providing incrementaldeployment
    paths to new, more powerful and/or more efficientprotocols. The architecture re-establishes
    the long-lost principlesof end-to-end reliability and fate sharing, in the presence
    ofexisting and future network middleboxes, and enables the deploymentof transport-neutral
    end-to-end protection without interfering withthese policy-enforcing or performance-enhancing
    middleboxes. Thisdocument describes architecture goals, a layering model supportingthese
    goals, abstract properties of the interfaces between thearchitecture's new layers,
    general approaches to multipath congestioncontrol and how they fit into the architecture,
    realistic protocoldesign and incremental deployment paths, and ways in which thisdocument
    complements and relates to ongoing protocol designactivities in the IETF.</p>"
