abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the pan European in- vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special
    form of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications
    and an integrated set of related data. This document also registers MIME media
    types and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data and
    metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP
    INFO requests. Although this specification is designed to meet the requirements
    of European next-generation eCall, it is specified generically such that the technology
    can be re-used or extended to suit requirements across jurisdictions.</p>
