abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of extensions for the Extensible Peer Protocol
    (XPP) required for creating a P2PSIP overlay network based on the CAN distributed
    hash table algorithm. It specifies how peers and clients must behave in order
    to maintain the overlay and use it for the establishment of multimedia communication
    sessions. To limit the overhead due to maintenance operations and to allow the
    adoption of security policies for preventing malicious nodes to damage the overlay,
    joins are always initiated and controlled by existing peers (hence the passive
    in PCAN).</p>"
