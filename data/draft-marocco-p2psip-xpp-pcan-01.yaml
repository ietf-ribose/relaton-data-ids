abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a set of extensions for the Extensible PeerProtocol
    (XPP) required for creating a P2PSIP overlay network basedon the CAN distributed
    hash table algorithm. It specifies how peersand clients must behave in order to
    maintain the overlay and use itfor the establishment of multimedia communication
    sessions.To limit the overhead due to maintenance operations and to allow theadoption
    of security policies for preventing malicious nodes todamage the overlay, joins
    are always initiated and controlled byexisting peers (hence the passive in PCAN).</p>"
