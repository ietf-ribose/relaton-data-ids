abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides guidelines for creating security capability\nprofiles.
    \ A profile is a list of features that are required to\noperate a device in a
    a secure manner in a specific environment.\n\nIt is anticipated that what is required
    in a profile will vary over\ntime and, across different classes of devices (e.g.
    a network edge\ndevice may need to filter customer traffic whereas core network\ndevices
    may not), and in different organizations.  This document does\nnot define a profile
    or specify requirements, but rather gives\nguidance for their creation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
