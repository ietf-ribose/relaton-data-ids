abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The flooding algorithm is one of the most important parts of any
    link\nstate routing protocol. It ensures that all routers within a link\nstate
    domain converge on the same topological information within a\nfinite period of
    time. To ensure reliability, typical implementations\nof the flooding algorithm
    send new information via all interfaces\nother than the one the new piece of information
    was received on. This\nredundancy is necessary to guarantee that flooding is performed\nreliably,
    but implies considerable overhead of utilized bandwidth and\nCPU time if neighboring
    routers are connected with more than one\nlink.  This document describes a method
    that reduces this overhead.\n\t </p>\n      "
