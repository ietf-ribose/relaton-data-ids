abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The eXtended-nonce ChaCha cipher construction (XChaCha) allows
    for\n   ChaCha-based ciphersuites to accept a 192-bit nonce with similar\n   guarantees
    to the original construction, except with a much lower\n   probability of nonce
    misuse occurring.  This enables XChaCha\n   constructions to be stateless, while
    retaining the same security\n   assumptions as ChaCha.\n\n   This document defines
    XChaCha20, which uses HChaCha20 to convert the\n   key and part of the nonce into
    a subkey, which is in turn used with\n   the remainder of the nonce with ChaCha20
    to generate a pseudorandom\n   keystream (e.g. for message encryption).\n\n   This
    document also defines AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305, a variant of\n   [RFC7539] that
    utilizes the XChaCha20 construction in place of\n   ChaCha20.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
