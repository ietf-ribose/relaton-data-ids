abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond
    to\n   queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term\n   problems
    with protocol development.\n\n   This document identifies a number of common classes
    of queries that\n   some servers fail to respond too.  This document also suggests\n
    \  procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply to help\n   reduce
    / eliminate the problem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
