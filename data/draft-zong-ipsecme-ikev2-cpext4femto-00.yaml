abstract:
- content: "<p>IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many standardized
    network solutions to provide the secure transport between network elements over
    third party's infrastructure. Today Femtocell deployment requires the mobile operator's
    Femtocell AP (FAP) to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support mutual authentication
    and data protection between the insecure Femtocell, which typically deployed in
    customer's premise, and its corresponding mobile core network. A known security
    threat exists in Femto architecture for failing to validate the FAP's identity
    and information provided by FAP at the mobile operator's core network. This document
    reviews this security threat and proposes a simple extension of the IKEv2 to resolve
    the issue.</p>"
