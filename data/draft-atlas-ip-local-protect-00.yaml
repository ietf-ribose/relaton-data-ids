abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines an architecture and selection process forproviding
    local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in theevent of a single link
    or node failure until the router hasconverged. When computing the primary next-hop
    for a prefix, arouter S also determines an alternate next-hop which can be used
    ifthe primary next-hop fails. The alternate can be either a loop-freealternate,
    which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path to the prefixdoes not go back through
    the router S, or a U-turn alternate, whichgoes to a neighbor whose primary next-hop
    to the prefix is the routerS, and which has itself a loop-free node-protecting
    alternate, whichthus does not go through router S to reach the destination prefix.</p>"
