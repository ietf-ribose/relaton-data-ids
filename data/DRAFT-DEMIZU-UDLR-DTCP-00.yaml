abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the Internet grows, the importance of Uni-Directional Links
    such\n   as satellite links has been increasing.  However, most of existing\n
    \  routing protocols assume that datalinks are bi-directional.  To\n   incorporate
    UDLs into the Internet, an IP tunneling approach has been\n   proposed, where
    tunnels are set up as a virtual back-channel of a UDL\n   to carry routing information
    between Feeders and Receivers.\n \n   Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol (DTCP)
    supports to setup\n   tunnels dynamically between Feeders and Receivers in such\n
    \  environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
