abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for allowing implementors to ensure
    that their implementation of the Environment option will be interoperable with
    as many other implementations as possible, by providing a set of heuristics that
    can be used to help identify which definitions for VAR and VALUE are being used
    by the other side of the connection. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
