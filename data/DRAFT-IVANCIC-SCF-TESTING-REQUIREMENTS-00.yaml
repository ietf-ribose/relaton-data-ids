abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidelines and requirements for testing
    Store,\n   Carry and Forward (SCF) systems and protocols.\n\n   The Testing Requirements
    document is one of three that fully describe\n   the SCF system.  The other two
    are the SCF Problem Statement and the\n   SCF Requirements and Expectations document.\n\n
    \  This document -00 is currently just an Skeletal Outline published so\n   the
    other two SCF documents can reference it.  The skeleton will be\n   filled in
    within the next month.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
