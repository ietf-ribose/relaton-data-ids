abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the application of the Hyper Text Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP) for system and network management. Presented are mechanisms which
    facilitate system and network management including the discovery of HTTP management
    entities and how management content may be accessed. Management and HTTP may be
    categorized into two groups, the management of HTTP[3] and management using HTTP.
    The focus of this document is on the latter, 'web based management'.</p>"
