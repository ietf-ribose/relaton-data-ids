abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been designed with
    TCP as\n   an underlying transport protocol.  The Constrained Application\n   Protocol
    (CoAP), which has been inspired by HTTP, has on the other\n   hand been defined
    to make use of UDP.  Therefore, reliable delivery\n   and a simple congestion
    control and flow control mechanism are\n   provided by the message layer of the
    CoAP protocol.\n\n   A number of environments benefit from the use of CoAP directly
    over a\n   reliable byte stream that already provides these services.  This\n
    \  document defines the use of CoAP over TCP as well as CoAP over TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n
