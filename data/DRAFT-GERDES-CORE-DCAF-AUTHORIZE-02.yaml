abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a protocol for delegating client\n
    \  authentication and authorization in a constrained environment for\n   establishing
    a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel\n   between resource-constrained
    nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS to\n   transfer authorization information
    and shared secrets for symmetric\n   cryptography between entities in a constrained
    network.  A resource-\n   constrained node can use this protocol to delegate authentication
    of\n   communication peers and management of authorization information to a\n
    \  trusted host with less severe limitations regarding processing power\n   and
    memory.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
