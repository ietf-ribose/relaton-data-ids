abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The document describes the process of discovering CoAP servers\ndistributed
    in multiple subnets in a non-specified topology.  CoAP\nDiscovery Gateways are
    used to discover one subnet from another.\nCoAP Discovery Gateways may provide
    caching to enable discovery of\nsleeping nodes in LLN environments.  The solution
    scales to large\ninstallations since discovery is handled by the client in an\nincremental
    fashion.\n\t </p>\n      "
