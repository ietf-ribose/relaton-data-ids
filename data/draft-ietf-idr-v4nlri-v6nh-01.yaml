abstract:
  content: "\t <t>MultiProtocol-BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of Network Layerprotocols
    to which the address carried in the Next Hop field maybelong is determined by
    the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and theSubsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFIdefinitions for the IPv4 address family only have
    provisions foradvertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol
    whenadvertising an IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) ora VPN-IPv4
    NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary toallow advertising an
    IPv4 NLRI or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hopaddress that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.
    This comprises anextension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of
    theNext Hop for an IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6protocol,
    the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which ofthe protocols the address
    actually belongs to, and a new BGPCapability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically
    discover whether theycan exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next
    Hop.</p>"
