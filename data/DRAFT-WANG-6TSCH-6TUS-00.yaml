abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the
    concept\n   of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow
    a\n   schedule.  A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic\n   link-layer
    resource, and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in\n   the network.  This
    allows the schedule to be built to tightly match\n   each node's bandwidth, latency
    and energy constraints, while ensuring\n   collision-free communication.  The
    [IEEE802154e] standard does not,\n   however, present a mechanism to do so, as
    building and managing the\n   schedule is out of the standard's scope.  Routing
    layers such as the\n   IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism
    to\n   route multipoint-to-point traffic (from devices inside the LLN\n   towards
    a central control point) and point-to-multipoint traffic\n   (from the central
    control point to the devices inside the LLN).\n   Network layer overlays cannot
    be optimized and adapted to take\n   advantage of the link-based topology created
    by the underlying TSCH\n   MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities need
    to be defined.\n   This document describes the 6tus adaptation layer and the main\n
    \  commands it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.\n   The
    set of functionalities includes feedback metrics from link states\n   so network
    layers can take routing decisions, TSCH configuration and\n   control procedures,
    and the support for centralized and decentralized\n   scheduling policies.\n\n\t
