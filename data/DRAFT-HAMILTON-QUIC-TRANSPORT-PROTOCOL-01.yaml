abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs
    on top\n   of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience, and implements\n
    \  mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport\n   protocol.
    \ Using UDP as the basis of QUIC is intended to address\n   compatibility issues
    with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC\n   authenticates all of its headers,
    preventing third parties from from\n   changing them.  QUIC encrypts most of its
    headers, thereby limiting\n   protocol evolution to QUIC endpoints only.  Therefore,
    middleboxes,\n   in large part, are not required to be updated as new protocol\n
    \  versions are deployed.  This document describes the core QUIC\n   protocol,
    including the conceptual design, wire format, and\n   mechanisms of the QUIC protocol
    for connection establishment, stream\n   multiplexing, stream and connection-level
    flow control, and data\n   reliability.  Accompanying documents describe QUIC's
    loss recovery\n   and congestion control, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation.\n\n\t
