abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes how to provide Internet connectivity to\nmobile
    ad hoc networks.  It describes a mechanism whereby the Ad\nhoc On-Demand Distance
    Vector (AODV) Routing protocol can cooperate\nwith the Mobile IP protocol such
    that mobile nodes within an ad hoc\nnetwork, which are out of direct transmission
    range of a foreign\nagent, can obtain a care-of address and register with the
    foreign\nagent to obtain Internet connectivity.  Mobile IP is used for mobile\nnode
    registrations with a foreign agent, while AODV is used for\nrouting within the
    ad hoc network and for obtaining routes to the\nforeign agent.  Once a manet node
    has a care-of address, it may send\ndata packets to destinations in the Internet
    by routing through the\nforeign agent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
