abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    energy management. The requirements presented in this document include monitoring
    functions as well as control functions. In detail, the focus of the requirements
    is on the following features: identification of powered entities, monitoring of
    their power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power quality, consumed
    energy, and contained batteries. Further, requirements are included to enable
    control of powered entities' power supply and power state. This document does
    not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations
    but rather features that must be supported by standards for energy management.</p>"
