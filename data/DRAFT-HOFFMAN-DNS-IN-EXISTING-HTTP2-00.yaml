abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Intermediaries such as governments and ISPs spoof DNS responses,
    and\n   block DNS requests to particular recursive resolvers, for a variety\n
    \  of reasons.  They spoof by capturing traffic on port 53, or by\n   redirecting
    port 853 traffic in the hopes that the client is using\n   opportunistic encryption.
    \ They block if they know the address of a\n   resolver that they don't like,
    such as public resolvers that give\n   honest answers.\n\n   This document describes
    how to run DNS service over existing HTTP/2\n   connections over TLS, such as
    those being used for HTTP for basic web\n   service.  This design prevents intermediaries
    from spoofing DNS\n   responses, and makes it impossible for intermediaries to
    block the\n   use of those recursive resolvers without blocking the desired HTTP\n
    \  connections.  It also prevents intermediaries or passive observers\n   from
    seeing the DNS traffic.  This design is meant for communication\n   between a
    DNS stub resolver and a DNS recursive resolver.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
