abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to
    enable direct client access to file data on storage, bypassing the NFSv4 server.
    This can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires additional client
    functionality, some of which depends upon the type of storage used. The pNFS specification
    for block storage (RFC 5663) describes how clients can identify the volumes used
    for pNFS, but this mechanism requires communication with the NFSv4 server. This
    document adds a mechanism to RFC 5663 that enables identification of block storage
    devices used by pNFS file systems without communicating with the server. This
    enables clients to control access to pNFS block devices when the client initially
    boots, as opposed to waiting until the client can communicate with the NFSv4 server.</p>"
