abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism for Autonomous Systems within anAS
    Confederation to survive the disconnection to other AS within theAS confederation
    without dropping peers. When all links to the otherAS in the Confederation break,
    this mechanism allows the AS to revertto local AS to continue communication with
    E-BGP peers. Thismechanism has two parts: Capability signaling between the two
    partiesat connection start to save two AS (internal and AS Confederation AS)and
    a mechanism to signal the switch between AS Confederation AS andinternal AS.</p>"
