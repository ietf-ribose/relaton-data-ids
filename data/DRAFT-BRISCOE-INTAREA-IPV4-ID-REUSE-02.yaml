abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that
    is both\n   principled and a hack.  It builds on recent moves to formalise the\n
    \  increasingly common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely\n   matches
    that of IPv6.  The large majority of IPv4 packets are now\n   'atomic', meaning
    indivisible.  In such packets, the 16 bits of the\n   IPv4 Identification (IPv4
    ID) field are redundant and could be freed\n   up for the Internet community to
    put to other uses, at least within\n   the constraints imposed by their original
    use for reassembly.  This\n   specification defines the process for redefining
    the semantics of\n   these bits.  It uses the previously reserved control flag
    in the IPv4\n   header to indicate that these 16 bits have new semantics.  Great
    care\n   is taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even in the\n   presence
    of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packets\n   that have the
    reserved control flag set.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
