abstract:
- content: <p>On 29 August 2012, the leaders of the IEEE Standards Association, the
    IAB, the IETF, the Internet Society, and the W3C signed a statement affirming
    the importance of a jointly developed set of principles establishing a modern
    paradigm for global, open standards. These principles have become known as the
    "OpenStand" principles. This document contains the text of the affirmation that
    was signed. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>
