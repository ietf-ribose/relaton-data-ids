abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Forward-RTO recovery (F-RTO) specified in RFC 4138 is an algorithm\n
    for detecting a spurious retransmission timeout with TCP and SCTP.\n This document
    describes the advantages of F-RTO and summarizes the\n experience in its implementations
    and the experiments conducted with\n it. By analyzing the implications of the
    spurious retransmission\n timeouts on the regular RTO recovery and Forward-RTO
    recovery\n algorithm, including a detailed corner case analysis, it shows that\n
    F-RTO does not have negative impact on the network when used with an\n appropriate
    response algorithm even in the rare cases where F-RTO\n falsely declares a retransmission
    timeout spurious. It concludes\n with a recommendation that F-RTO is to be advanced
    to the standards\n track.\n\t </p>\n      "
