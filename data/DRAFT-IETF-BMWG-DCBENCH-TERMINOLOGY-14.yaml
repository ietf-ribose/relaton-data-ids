abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions\nand
    describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as\nwell as it is
    to introduce new terminologies applicable to data center\nperformance evaluations.
    The purpose of this document is not to define\nthe test methodology, but rather
    establish the important concepts for\nbenchmarking network switches and routers
    in the data center. Many of\nthese terms and methods may be applicable beyond
    this publication's\nscope as the technologies originally applied in the data center
    are\ndeployed elsewhere.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
