abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL uses distribution trees to deliver multi-destination
    frames.\n   Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for flows regardless\n
    \  of the VLAN, Fine Grained Label (FGL), and/or multicast group of the\n   flow.
    Different ingress RBridges may choose different distribution\n   trees for TRILL
    Data packets in the same VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast\n   group. To avoid unnecessary
    link utilization, distribution trees\n   should be pruned based on VLAN and/or
    FGL and/or multicast\n   destination address. If any VLAN, FGL, or multicast group
    can be sent\n   on any tree, for typical fast path hardware, the amount of pruning\n
    \  information is multiplied by the number of tree; however, there is a\n   limited
    capacity for such pruning information.\n\n   This document specifies an optional
    facility to restrict the TRILL\n   Data packets sent on particular distribution
    trees by VLAN, FGL,\n   and/or multicast group thus reducing the total amount
    of pruning\n   information so that it can more easily be accommodated by fast
    path\n   hardware.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
