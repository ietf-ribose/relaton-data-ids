abstract:
- content: '<p>The MPLS architecture introduced Special Purpose Labels (SPLs) to indicate
    special forwarding actions and offered a few simple examples, such as Router Alert.
    In the two decades since the original architecture was crafted, the range, complexity
    and sheer number of such actions has grown; in addition, there now is need for
    "associated data" for some of the forwarding actions. Likewise, the capabilities
    and scale of forwarding engines has also improved vastly over the same time period.
    There is a pressing need to match the needs with the capabilities to deliver the
    next generation of MPLS architecture. In this memo, we propose an alternate mechanism
    whereby a single SPL can encode multiple forwarding actions and carry associated
    data, some in the label stack and some after the label stack. This proposal also
    solves the problem of scarcity of base SPLs. This approach can immediately address
    several use cases: * to carry a Slice Selector for IETF network slicing; * to
    signal that further fast reroute may have harmful consequences; * to indicate
    that there is relevant data after the label stack; * among others.</p>'
