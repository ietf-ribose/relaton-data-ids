abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an information model that defines the\n
    \  salient managed entities and their relationships in an Interface to\n   Network
    Security Function (I2NSF) architecture. The information\n   model is independent
    of platform, language, and protocol, and serves\n   as a common consensual lexicon
    for the I2NFS architecture as well as\n   clients using this architecture. This
    enables multiple application-\n   specific data models (which are dependent on
    platform, language,\n   and/or protocol) to be built from this information model.
    The\n   advantage of doing so is to ensure that such data models will be\n   able
    to share and reuse consensually defined concepts, thereby\n   increasing interoperability.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
