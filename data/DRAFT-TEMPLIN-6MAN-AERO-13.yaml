abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization\n
    \  (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network\n   (OMNI)
    interfaces.  AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format\n   that supports
    operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol\n   and links ND to IP
    forwarding.  Prefix delegation/registration\n   services are employed for network
    admission and to manage the routing\n   system.  Secure multilink operation, mobility
    management, multicast,\n   traffic selector signaling and route optimization are
    naturally\n   supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  AERO is a widely-\n
    \  applicable mobile internetworking service especially well-suited to\n   aviation
    services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile Virtual\n   Private Networks
    (VPNs) and many other applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
