abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The pre-requisite for IP based seamless mobility protocols is
    the\nknowledge of the access router (AR) to which a mobile node can be\nhanded
    over to. Further, a handoff can be optimized if the capabilities\nof the AR being
    considered for handoff are known. The protocol which\ndiscovers ARs for potential
    handoff along with their capabilities is\ncalled the CAR discovery protocol. In
    this draft we list the\nrequirements which are to be met by CAR discovery protocols.\n\t
