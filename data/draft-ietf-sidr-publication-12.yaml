abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for publishing Resource Public Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI) objects. Even though the RPKI will have many participants
    issuing certificates and creating other objects, it is operationally useful to
    consolidate the publication of those objects. Even in cases where a certificate
    issuer runs its own publication repository, it can be useful to run the certificate
    engine itself on a different machine from the publication repository. This document
    defines a protocol which addresses these needs.</p>"
