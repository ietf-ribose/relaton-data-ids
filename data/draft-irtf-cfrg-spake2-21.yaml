abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2 which is a protocol for two parties
    that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password.
    This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and SPAKE2
    has a security proof. This document predated the CFRG PAKE competition and it
    was not selected. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
