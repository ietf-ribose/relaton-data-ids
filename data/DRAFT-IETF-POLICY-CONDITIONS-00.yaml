abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an information model for\n      networking
    policy conditions as part of the general\n      information model for representing
    networking policy\n      defined in draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt.  The\n
    \     information model described in this document is focussed\n      on the structural
    class networkingPolicyCondition\n      that extends the class policyCondition
    described\n      draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt.  Five auxiliary\n      classes
    are defined to describe conditions that refer to\n      (1) the communicating
    hosts, (2) the communicating users\n      (3) application data (4) routing information
    at the device\n      enforcing the policy and (5) layer 2 or data link layer\n
    \     information of the device.  This document is based on the\n      QoS and
    IPSec schema first described in [3] and [4].\n\t </p>\n      "
