abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides guidance on the design of methods to
    avoid\n   congestion collapse and to provide congestion control.\n   Recommendations
    and requirements on this topic are distributed across\n   many documents in the
    RFC series.  This therefore seeks to gather and\n   consolidate these recommendations
    and provide overall guidance.  It\n   is intended to provide input to the design
    of new congestion control\n   methods in protocols, such as the IETF Quick UDP
    Internet Connections\n   (QUIC) transport.\n\n   The present document is for discussion
    and comment by the IETF.  If\n   published, it plans to update or replace the
    Best Current Practice in\n   BCP 41, which currently includes \"Congestion Control
    Principles\"\n   provided in RFC2914.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
