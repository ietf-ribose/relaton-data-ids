abstract:
  content: <p>RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter. This
    includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send "load" information, even
    when the node is not overloaded. The base solution defined in RFC 7683 (Diameter
    Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC)) describes a mechanism meeting most of
    the requirements but does not currently include the ability to send load information.
    This document defines a mechanism for the conveying of Diameter load information.</p>
