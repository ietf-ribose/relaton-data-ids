abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the convergence of computing, storage and network, especially\n
    \  the maturity of data center technology, it becomes a trend that ISP\n   would
    like to deploy the computing and storage resources in the\n   network, so that
    the optimized resource utilization as well as the\n   value-added service can
    be provided.  The data centers deployed in\n   the network can provide the runtime
    environment and resource to\n   optimize ICP services with various edge service
    proxies, such as CDN\n   servers and distributed Trackers.  Meanwhile, based on
    data centers\n   ISP can provide all kinds of value-added services in the IP based\n
    \  network.  CNO (Core Network Overlay)is an ISP-controlled overlay\n   network
    constructed on top of the core network which is proposed as a\n   solution to
    large-scale data distribution in the Internet.  It can\n   provide the transfer
    service for data distribution and switching in\n   the core network for the ICP
    and its edge service proxies.  Because\n   the CNO nodes are trustworthy (controlled
    by ISP), stable and have a\n   simple economic model (without any participation
    of end users and\n   ICPs), various overlay based data distribution methods are
    easier to\n   be applied and standardized with CNO.  This draft presents the\n
    \  definition of the conceptions and terms about CNO.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
