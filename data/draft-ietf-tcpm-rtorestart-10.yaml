abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a modified sender-side algorithm for managing
    the TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) retransmission timers
    that provides faster loss recovery when there is a small amount of outstanding
    data for a connection. The modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport
    to restart its retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that
    the effective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in situations
    where fast retransmit cannot be used. This enables faster loss detection and recovery
    for connections that are short lived or application limited.</p>"
