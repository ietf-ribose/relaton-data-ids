abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ACKs are used by transport protocols to confirm delivery of
    packets.\n   The transmission of ACKs consumes resources at the receiver, in the\n
    \  network and at the sender.  On network paths where there is\n   significant
    path asymmetry, acknowledgments of data receipt can\n   reduce the efficient use
    of network capacity.  This effect occurs\n   when the return capacity is significantly
    more constrained than the\n   forward capacity, or the cost of transmission per
    packet is a\n   significant component of the total transmission cost.  In these\n
    \  cases, reducing the ratio of acknowledgements to data can improve\n   link
    utilization and reduce link transmission costs.  It can also\n   reduce processing
    overhead at the sender and receiver.\n\n   This document proposes a change to
    the default acknowledgement policy\n   of the QUIC transport protocol to improve
    performance over paths with\n   appreciable asymmetry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
