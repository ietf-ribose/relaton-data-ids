abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a new technology named iCAN (instant Congestion\n
    \  Assessment Network), which represents a set of mechanisms running\n   directly
    on network nodes.  These mechanisms allow the nodes\n   adjusting the flows' paths
    based on real-time measurement of the\n   candidate paths.  The measurement is
    to reflect the congestion\n   situation of each path, so that the nodes could
    decide which flows\n   need to be switched from a path to another.\n\n   This
    is something that current TE technologies can hardly achieve.\n   In current TE,
    the paths are usually planned in a certralized\n   controller, which is far from
    the data plane, thus neither be able to\n   assess the real-time congestion situation
    of each path, nor able to\n   assure the data plane always go as expected (especially
    in SRv6\n   scenarios).  In a result, traditional TE is not able to adjust the\n
    \  flow paths in real-time to fit for the change of traffic instantly.\n\n   iCAN
    can work with traditional TE perfectly: the controller plans\n   multi-path transmission
    in relatively long period (e.g. minutes), and\n   iCAN does the flow path optimization
    in a much shorter interval (e.g.\n   milliseconds).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
