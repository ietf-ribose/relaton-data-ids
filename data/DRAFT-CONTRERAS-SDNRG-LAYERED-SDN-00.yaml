abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Software Defined Networking paradigm proposes the separation
    of\n   the control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its\n   logical
    centralization on a control entity.  All the network\n   intelligence is moved
    to this central entity.  Typically, such\n   central entity is seen as a compendium
    of interacting control\n   functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion.
    \ The relocation of\n   the control functions from a number of distributed network
    nodes to a\n   logical central entity conceptually places together a number of\n
    \  control capabilities with different purposes.  As a consequence, the\n   existing
    solutions do not provide a clear separation between services\n   and transport
    control.\n\n   This document describes a new proposal named Cooperating Layered\n
    \  Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind that is to differentiate the\n   control
    functions associated to transport from those related to\n   services, in such
    a way that they can be provided and maintained\n   independently, and can follow
    their own evolutionary way.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
