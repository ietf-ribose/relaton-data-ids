abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The WebTransport Protocol Framework enables clients constrained
    by\n   the Web security model to communicate with a remote server using a\n   secure
    multiplexed transport.  It consists of a set of individual\n   protocols that
    are safe to expose to untrusted applications, combined\n   with a model that allows
    them to be used interchangeably.\n\n   This document defines the overall requirements
    on the protocols used\n   in WebTransport, as well as the common features of the
    protocols,\n   support for some of which may be optional.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
