abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, distributing traffic
    to a\ncluster of multiple downstream servers, can use the DNS SRV mechanism\nto
    perform load balancing.  However, the \"weight\" field in the DNS\nSRV mechanism
    is intended for static server selection.  Over time,\nthe traffic arriving at
    the downstream SIP servers may cause them to\nenter an overload condition, adversely
    impacting the throughput of\nthe SIP cluster.  This document proposes to impart
    the dynamic load\nof each SIP server to the load distributing SIP proxy, thereby\nallowing
    it to load balance the traffic so as to reduce --- or even\nprevent --- an overload
    condition.\n\t </p>\n      "
