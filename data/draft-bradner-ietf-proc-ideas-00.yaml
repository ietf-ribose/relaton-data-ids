abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The problem working group has shown that a number of IETFparticipants
    feel that the current process by which the IETF approvesdocuments for publication
    as RFCs needs to be changed. There doesnot seem to be consensus on specific reasons
    that change is neededbut there seems to be consensus that change is needed. This
    documentis designed to provide some ideas on different ways that the currentprocesses
    could be revised. My intent is to spur discussion onpossibilities, not to say
    (at this time) what my preference is.</p>"
