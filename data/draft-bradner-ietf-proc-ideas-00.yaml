abstract:
- content: "<p>The problem working group has shown that a number of IETF participants
    feel that the current process by which the IETF approves documents for publication
    as RFCs needs to be changed. There does not seem to be consensus on specific reasons
    that change is needed but there seems to be consensus that change is needed. This
    document is designed to provide some ideas on different ways that the current
    processes could be revised. My intent is to spur discussion on possibilities,
    not to say (at this time) what my preference is.</p>"
