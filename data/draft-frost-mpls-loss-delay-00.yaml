abstract:
  content: "<p>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on theability
    to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet lossand one-way and two-way
    delay, as well as related metrics such asdelay variation and channel throughput.
    This capability, inaddition, provides operators with greater visibility into theperformance
    characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitatingplanning, troubleshooting,
    and evaluation. This document specifiesprotocol mechanisms to enable the efficient
    and accurate measurementof these performance metrics in MPLS networks.</p>"
