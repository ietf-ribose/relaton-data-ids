abstract:
  content: "<p>ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefitof private users
    of the Internet. It makes use ofauthoritative E.164 telephone number data maintainedamong
    public telecommunication service providers toenable some useful value added messaging
    services onthe Internet. Anyone can (and several companies do)provide these ENUM
    services competitively today withoutgovernment involvement or regulation. Other
    providerscan enter the marketplace.Although one ENUM provisioning option is to
    denominatea particular Internet offering worldwide as 'public'and 'authoritative,'
    there are significant technical,operational, and regulatory burdens and costs
    createdthat make the prospect rather daunting at best. It isalso unnecessary.
    A more effective alternative is tofacilitate ENUM service providers' access to
    authoritative E.164 number and customer information through fair and non-discriminatory
    contractual arrangements with public telecommunication service providers, and
    leave the rest to a competitive ENUM provider marketplace and the commercial relationships
    between Internet Service Providers and public telecommunication carriers.</p>"
