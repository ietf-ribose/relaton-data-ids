abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining
    QoS\nfor inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain.  The PCN architecture\nrequires
    that egress nodes send regular reports of PCN-defined\nmeasurements to a decision
    point.  It requires further that the\ndecision point occasionally be able to request
    certain measurements\nfrom ingress nodes.  The decision point can be located in
    different\nplaces in the network.  This memo defines a Diameter application to\nsupport
    communications between the ingress and egress nodes and a\nDiameter server acting
    as a PCN decision point.\n\t </p>\n      "
