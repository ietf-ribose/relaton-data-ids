abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recent Targeted LDP applications such as Remote LFA and BGP
    auto\n   discovery FEC 129 pseudowire may automatically establish a targeted\n
    \  LDP session to any LSR in the core network. The sender LSR has\n   information
    about the targeted applications to administratively\n   control initiation of
    the session. However the receiver LSR has no\n   such information to control the
    acceptance of this session. This\n   document defines a mechanism to advertise
    Targeted Application\n   Capability during session initialization. As the receiver
    LSR becomes\n   aware of targeted LDP applications, it may establish a limited
    number\n   of sessions for certain applications. In addition, each targeted\n
    \  application is mapped to LDP FEC Elements to advertise only necessary\n   LDP
    FEC label bindings over the session.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
