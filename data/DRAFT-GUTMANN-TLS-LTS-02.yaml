abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 for long-term
    support,\n   one that represents what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with
    the\n   security holes and bugs fixed.  This represents a stable, known-good\n
    \  profile that can be deployed now to systems that can't roll out\n   patches
    every month or two when the next attack on TLS is published.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
