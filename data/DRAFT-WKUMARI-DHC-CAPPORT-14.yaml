abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet
    access\n   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n
    \  captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until
    the customer has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and
    a RA extension) to inform\n   clients that they are behind some sort of captive
    portal device, and\n   that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access.
    \ It is\n   not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may\n
    \  have with captive portals; it is designed to be used in larger\n   solutions.
    \ The method of authenticating to, and interacting with the\n   captive portal
    is out of scope of this document.\n\n   [ Ed note (remove): This document is being
    developed in github:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dhc-capport
    . ]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
