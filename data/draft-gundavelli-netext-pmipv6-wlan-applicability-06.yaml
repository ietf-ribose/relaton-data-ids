abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol.
    The protocol is designed for providing mobility management support to a mobile
    node, without requiring its participation in any IP mobility related signaling.
    The base protocol is defined in an access technology independent manner, it identifies
    the general requirements from the link-layer for supporting the protocol operation.
    However, it does not provide any specific details on how it can be supported on
    a specific access technology. This specification identifies the key considerations
    for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol on the widely deployed wireless LAN
    access architectures, based on IEEE 802.11 standards. It explores the current
    dominant wireless LAN deployment models and provides the needed interworking details.</p>"
