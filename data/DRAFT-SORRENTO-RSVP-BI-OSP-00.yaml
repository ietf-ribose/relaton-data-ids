abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose an extension to RSVP-TE for setting up and maintaining
    \nBi-directional Optical Switched Paths (BOSPs) in optical networks \nwith symmetric
    traffic patterns. The requirement for wavelength \ncontinuity for some types of
    optical networks with no (or partial) \nwavelength conversion is also supported.
    It follows the framework \nof MPLS and extends the RSVP-TE to support the signaling
    for the \nprovisioning of BOSPs. We introduce a new c-types for bi-directional\nLSPs
    in both Label Request object and Label object. Each LSR (OXC), \nupon receiving
    an RESV message for a BOSP, will allocate a pair of \nlabels. One label is for
    the incoming port from the next hop and \nthe other is for the incoming port from
    the previous hop. The labels\nhere include fiber ID, wavelength ID and sub-channel
    ID (if \napplicable). This extension requires a minimum change to the \nexisting
    RSVP-TE protocol. It avoids the problem of contention where\ntwo OXCs assign the
    same wavelength on a uni-directional link for \ntwo different sessions. This contention
    arises in both [4] and [5].\nAs a result, no additional mechanism  for contention
    resolution is \nneeded.\n\t </p>\n      "
