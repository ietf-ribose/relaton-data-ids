abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system forsupporting
    quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. Theterm `in-band signaling`
    refers to the fact that control informationis carried along with data in IP packets.
    We argue that in-bandsignaling is more suitable than explicit out-of-band approaches(e.g.,
    RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality of service in highlydynamic environments
    such as mobile ad hoc networks where networktopology, node connectivity and end-to-end
    quality of service arestrongly time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed to support the
    deliveryof adaptive real-time services and includes fastsession/flow/microflow
    reservation, restoration and adaptationalgorithms between source/destination pairs.
    In this memo we discusshow INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a wireless
    flowmanagement model for mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces tothe proposed
    MANET Working Group routing algorithm.</p>"
