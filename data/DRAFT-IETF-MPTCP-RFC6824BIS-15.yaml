abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path
    per\n   connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\n   simultaneous
    use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would\n   improve resource usage
    within the network and, thus, improve user\n   experience through higher throughput
    and improved resilience to\n   network failure.\n\n   Multipath TCP provides the
    ability to simultaneously use multiple\n   paths between peers.  This document
    presents a set of extensions to\n   traditional TCP to support multipath operation.
    \ The protocol offers\n   the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e.,
    reliable\n   bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish\n
    \  and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.\n\n   This document
    specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as\n   specified in RFC6824, through
    clarifications and modifications\n   primarily driven by deployment experience.\n\n\t
