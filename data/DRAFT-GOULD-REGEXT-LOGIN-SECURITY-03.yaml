abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes a client\n
    \  authentication scheme that is based on a user identifier and\n   password.
    \ The structure of the password field is defined by an XML\n   Schema data type
    that specifies minimum and maximum password length\n   values, but there are no
    other provisions for password management\n   other than changing the password.
    \ This document describes an EPP\n   extension that allows longer passwords to
    be created and adds\n   additional security features to the EPP login command
    and response.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
