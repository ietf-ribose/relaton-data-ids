abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a prooftype involving PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)
    for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the Extensible Messaging and
    Presence Protocol (XMPP). It also defines a method involving HTTPS redirects (appropriate
    for use with the POSH prooftype) for securely delegating a source domain to a
    derived domain in XMPP.</p>"
