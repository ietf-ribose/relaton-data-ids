abstract:
  content: <p>The "tel" URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for Telephone Numbers[RFC3966]
    describes resources identified by telephone numbers. Theseresources specify termination
    points within a public or privatetelephone network. The termination points are
    a globally or locallyunique endpoint. RFC3966 does not address the means by which
    thetelephone URI can be used to reach termination point from a specificnode in
    the telephone network.This document specifies the means by which the termination
    point isreached from a specific node in the telephone network. This documentspecifies
    how to encode the numbers, symbols and pauses required totraverse the phone network
    to reach the termination point in an RFC3966 compliant "tel" URI.</p>
