abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that
    are\nrobust, easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy to\ncompute.  The
    IPPM WG has defined a large number of richly\nparameterized metrics because network
    measurement has many purposes.\nOften, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise
    set of metrics\ndescribing a network's state to an end user.  It is for this purpose\nthat
    the present set of metrics is defined.\n\t </p>\n      "
