abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is intended to provide input to the IETF SPIRITSWorking
    Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT Working Group (PINTWG) from the viewpoint
    of European network operators that areinvolved in EURESCOM P909 Project 'Enabling
    Technologies for INEvolution and IN-Internet Integration'. The input is based
    on current results that were achieved in the project. As the project title says
    P909 project deals with IN-Internet integration issues. The projecthas defined
    an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration and it hasselected and described
    some IN-Internet services which can beinteresting from the business perspective
    and challenging from thetechnical perspective. Some of these services are 'officially'
    chartered in IETF: ICW inSPIRITS, Click-to-Dial (Request to Call) as well as proposedConference
    Service in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet convergence services
    that P909 studies and that are included in thisdocument only as examples.</p>"
