abstract:
- content: "<p>The increase in complexity of modern networks makes it challenging
    to deploy new services and to keep networks up to date whilst maintaining stability
    and availability for critical business services. This is a major challenge that
    network operators (service providers, SME, etc) face today. The operators aim
    of streamlining both operations and the deployment of new services, is being met
    by increasingly relying on programmatic control of network elements and by the
    use of various virtualization technologies. In this context, providing network
    operators with a set of standard generic YANG-based service and policy models
    that enable management and automation of services on their network is essential.</p>"
