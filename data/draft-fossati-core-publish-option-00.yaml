abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP). The Publish Option is used by a sleepy node to temporarily delegate
    the authority of one of its resources to another, always on, node which is typically
    a proxy but doesn't need to be necessarily. The sleepy node is given a simple
    RESTful messaging protocol that enables the setup, renew and removal of the authority
    transfer. The whole process is driven by the (sleepy) origin, which may actually
    never need to listen or to keep any state.</p>"
