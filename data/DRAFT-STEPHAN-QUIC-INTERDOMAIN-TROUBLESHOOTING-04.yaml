abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On-path network performance measurements methods currently
    deployed\n   contribute to the ossification of the Internet because they are\n
    \  expensive to deploy and to maintain. This draft motivates the\n   exposure
    of QUIC header fields for on-path network measurements and\n   their specification
    in the QUIC core protocol as a solution to avoid\n   on-path network performance
    measurements to ossify the IP stack in\n   the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
