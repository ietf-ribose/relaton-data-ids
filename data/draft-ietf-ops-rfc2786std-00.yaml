abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.In particular,
    it defines a textual convention for doing Diffie-Hellman key agreement key exchanges
    and a set of objects which extendthe usmUserTable to permit the use of a DH key
    exchange in additionto the key change method described in [14]. In other words,
    this MIBadds the possibility of forward secrecy to the USM model. It alsodefines
    a set of objects that can be used to kick start security onan SNMPv3 agent when
    the out of band path is authenticated, but notnecessarily private or confidential.The
    author is submitting this draft at the request of the O&amp;M areadirector. This
    memo revises and updates RFC 2786 [19] with the goalof moving the described protocol
    and MIB from Experimental toStandards Track. The one minor substantive change
    from theExperimental RFC is a restatement of the conditions on the selectionof
    the DH public number (see DHKeyChange and usmDHKickstartMyPublicin the body of
    the MIB as well as the MIBs revision history). Thespelling of 'Hellman' was corrected
    throughout. Author contactinformation was updated. Slight structural modifications
    were madeto more cleanly seperate boilerplate from substantive text.</p>"
