abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF requires English for technical discussion in working
    groups,\n   in working group documents and in anything considered for\n   publication.
    \ Use of English simplifies overhead and makes for clear\n   discussion of a single
    document in a single language, but\n   disadvantages those who lack fluency and
    comfort in English.\n\n   This document proposes setting up talk mailing lists
    for languages\n   other than English, where technical matters can be discussed
    in\n   comfort, and perhaps even be written up in internet-draft form in a\n   language
    other than English.  Once technical ideas are in place, a\n   draft can move forward
    to a working group in English.\n\n   Exposing non-English speakers to the IETF
    will, in the interests of\n   diversity, allow them to gain familiarity with IETF
    processes while\n   discussing with other fluent speakers of their language.  This\n
    \  benefits the IETF by attracting a broader constituency while meeting\n   its
    diversity goals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
