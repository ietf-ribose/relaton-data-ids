abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an improved HTTP caching method which
    can be\n   applied in addition to the standard caching behavior for HTTP.  It\n
    \  defines the associated header field that controls this improved\n   caching
    mechanism and a modified caching operation which is slightly\n   different to
    standard caching operation for HTTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
