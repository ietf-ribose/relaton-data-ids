abstract:
  content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and simplicity
    of IP routing together with the high-speed switching ofATM. Mobile IP is a protocol
    that allows mobile users to maintaincontinuous IP network connectivity. In this
    document, we describea scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols.
    Theintegration of both these protocols improves the scalability of theMobile IP
    data forwarding process by leveraging on the features ofMPLS which are fast switching,
    small state maintenance and highscalability. In addition, we have removed the
    need for IP-in-IP tunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign Agent (FA) under thisscheme.
    This document defines the signaling and control mechanismsrequired to integrate
    MPLS and Mobile IP.</p>"
