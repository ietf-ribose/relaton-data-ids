abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a reliable MANET routing mechanism
    based on\n   the node mobility detection. To detect the node mobility, each node\n
    \  maintains the Neighbor Node table and measures the stability of\n   its neighboring
    environment. Using the route stability information,\n   reliabille routing can
    be achieved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
