abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6761 requires that proponents document how a specific name is to
    be treated within the DNS protocol, public database, and administrative infrastructure,
    but doesn't provide any guidance to help the community figure out whether a particular
    registration is otherwise beneficial. This limited guidance in RFC 6761 provides
    flexibility in standardizing the use of domain names in the modern Internet outside
    of conventional DNS protocol or the public DNS database. This flexibility has
    been useful from time to time but has also caused significant confusion (see RFC
    8244). This document attempts to define guidelines for the IESG and the IETF community
    on the interpretation of RFC 6761 and the use of the special use names registry.</p>"
