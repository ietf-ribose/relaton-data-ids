abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In addition to its use as a subnetwork layer for IP (e.g.,
    via\n   RFC 7668), in various IoT web applications Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\n
    \  can serve as a \"local interconnect\", connecting devices locally\n   (i.e.,
    not over IP) for use as a source of information and a target\n   for actuation.
    \ In order to fully use these capabilities in\n   applications using web technologies,
    there is a need for a method for\n   addressing the resources, i.e., a URI scheme,
    and definition of the\n   representation of the data exchanged between the application
    and\n   devices, i.e., media types.  This document is a straw man proposal\n   for
    such a URI scheme and media types for interacting with the\n   Bluetooth GAP and
    GATT protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
