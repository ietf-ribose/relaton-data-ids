abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
    messages and processing. Traditionally, prefixes contained in RAs are used for
    on-link determination, on-link address auto- configuration, but not for path setup
    towards multi-hop destinations. The extensions proposed here still rely on RAs
    being communicated on a single link (not across several IP hops), but upon RA
    reception the prefixes are installed in the routing table; they are thus used
    for forwarding packets further than a single link (multi IP hop).</p>"
