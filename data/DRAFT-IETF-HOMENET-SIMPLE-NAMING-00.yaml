abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a simple name resolution and service\n
    \  discovery architecture for homenets, using the 'home.arpa' domain\n   name
    hierarchy.  This architecture covers local publication of names,\n   as well as
    name resolution service for local and global names for\n   devices connected to
    the homenet.\n\n   This document does not cover discovery of homenet services
    by devices\n   not connected to the homenet, nor DNSSEC, nor acquisition and\n
    \  configuration of a global name as an alternative to 'home.arpa'.\n   These
    topics will be addressed in a separate document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
