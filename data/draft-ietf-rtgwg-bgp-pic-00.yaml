abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millionsof
    routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Giventhe large scaling
    targets, it is desirable to restore traffic afterfailure in a time period that
    does not depend on the number of BGPprefixes. In this document we proposed an
    architecture by whichtraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in atimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in ahierarchical manner and
    sharing forwarding elements among the maximumpossible number of routes. The proposed
    technique achieves prefixindependent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment,complete
    transparency and automation, and zero management andprovisioning effort. It is
    noteworthy to mention that the benefits ofBGP-PIC are hinged on the existence
    of more than one path whether asECMP or primary-backup.</p>"
