abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration,
    was\n   to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use\n
    \  service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately\n   that
    hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation\n   where all kinds
    of configuration options are added to RAs.  This\n   document proposes a new universal
    option for RA in a self-describing\n   data format, with the list of elements
    maintained in an IANA\n   registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
