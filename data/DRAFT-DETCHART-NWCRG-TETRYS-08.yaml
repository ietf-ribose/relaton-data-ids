abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n
    \  Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  It conforms to the directions\n   found
    in the NWCRG taxonomy [RFC8406] .\n\n   This document describes Tetrys, an On-The-Fly
    Network Coding (NC)\n   protocol that can be used to transport delay and loss-sensitive
    data\n   over a lossy network.  Tetrys can recover from erasures within an\n   RTT-independent
    delay, thanks to the transmission of coded packets.\n   It can be used for both
    unicast, multicast and anycast\n   communications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
