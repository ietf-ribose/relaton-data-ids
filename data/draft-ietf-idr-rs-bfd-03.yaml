abstract:
- content: "<p>When BGP route servers are used, the data plane is not congruent with
    the control plane. Therefore, peers at an Internet exchange can lose data connectivity
    without the control plane being aware of it, and packets are lost. This document
    proposes the use of a newly defined BGP Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)
    both to allow the route server to request its clients use BFD to track data plane
    connectivity to their peers' addresses, and for the clients to signal that connectivity
    state back to the route server.</p>"
