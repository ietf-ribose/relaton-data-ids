abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises
    from\nthe desire to treat a set or group of names as \"aliases\" of each\nother,
    \"bundled,\" \"variants,\" or \"the same,\" which is problematic in\nterms of
    corresponding behavior for DNS labels.\n\nWith the emergence of internationalized
    domain names, among other\npotential use cases, two or more names that users will
    regard as\nhaving identical meaning will sometimes require corresponding\nbehavior
    in the DNS.  It's not clear how to accommodate these\nrequirements for behavior
    of such names in DNS resolution; in\nparticular, it's not clear when they are
    best accommodated in\nregistry practices for generating names for lookup in the
    DNS,\nexisting DNS protocol elements and behavior, or some set of protocol\nelements
    or behavior not yet defined.  This document attempts to\ndescribe some of these
    cases and the behavior of some of the possible\nsolutions discussed to date.\n\nNOTE:
    Even more than usual, version -02 of this document is a \"work\nin progress\".
    \ Additional updates may be expected between the date of\nthis document and the
    DNSEXT meeting in Beijing, and can be found at\nhttp://users.isc.org/~woolf.\n\t
