abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, to provide full\n
    \  compatibility with existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes,\n   but
    provides a richer set of facilities to the application.  Minion's\n   richer facilities
    include a message-oriented API rather than TCP's\n   unstructured byte-stream
    service model, multiplexing of multiple\n   messages (or message streams) on a
    single connection, interleaving of\n   multiplexed messages (to eliminate head-of-line
    blocking), message\n   cancellation, request/reply support, ordered and unordered
    messages,\n   superseding messages, chained messages, multiple priority levels
    with\n   byte-granularity preemption, and DTLS Security.  Minion can be\n   implemented
    entirely as a user-level library, without waiting for any\n   special support
    from OS vendors, and provides immediate benefits to\n   application developers.
    \ Additionally, Minion is able to take\n   advantage of some simple kernel extensions
    to provide enhanced\n   services that go beyond what is possible with traditional
    TCP.  These\n   kernel extensions are optional, and even without them, Minion
    offers\n   worthwhile benefits to application developers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
