abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets
    route\n   stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing\n
    \  CPU load on the routers.\n\n   But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE
    recommended not to use\n   Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).\n\n   Now, some
    researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive\n   parameters, back on
    [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].\n\n   This document describes results of a survey conducted
    amoung service\n   provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.\n\n\t </p>\n
