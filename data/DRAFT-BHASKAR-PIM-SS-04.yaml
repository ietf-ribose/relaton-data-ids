abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that
    only\nbuilds source specific shortest path trees. These trees are built\ndirectly
    on receiving group membership reports that request a given\nsource. PIM-SS precludes
    the building of shared trees, effectively par-\ntitioning the different source
    trees from one another. For this reason\nit is specifically suited for existing
    multicast applications for which\nthere is expected and intended to be exactly
    one source.\n\nSource-Specific PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset
    of PIM-SM\nmessages and lends itself to incremental deployment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
