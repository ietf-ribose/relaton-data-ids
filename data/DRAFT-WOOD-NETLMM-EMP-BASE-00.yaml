abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a protocol for localized mobility management
    \nwhich allows the mobile node to keep using the same IP address while \nit is
    in the same localized mobility management domain. The protocol \nenables the edge
    mobility anchor point to manage the routing path for \nthe mobile node in the
    domain, so that the packet form the \ncorrespondent node can be delivered to the
    access router of MN \ncurrently connecting. For routing path management, the protocol
    also \nspecifies the functionality of the access router to provide the MN's \nIP
    address, MN identifier to edge mobility anchor point. The protocol \ndoes not
    require the mobile node to involve in the mobility \nmanagement if link layer
    technology can provide MN related \ninformation necessary for this protocol.  \n\t
