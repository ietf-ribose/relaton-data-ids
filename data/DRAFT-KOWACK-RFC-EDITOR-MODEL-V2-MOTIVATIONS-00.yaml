  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides the background and motivations for the\nrecommendations
    made in draft-kowack-rfc-editor-model-v2-overview-00.\nIt represents the perspectives
    resulting from an individual\nmanagerial and analytical effort of nearly one year's
    duration.  It\ncontains a summary of the factors considered to be essential to
    the\njob of RFC Series Editor (RSE).  This includes a summary of the work\ndone
    as part of the RFC Editor, the differences between [RFC5620]and\nthe [I-D.v2-overview]
    recommendations, a discussion of development\nwork that should be done, and an
    assessment of the time needed to\nperform the RSE job.  There is also a section
    listing and responding\nto questions surrounding the recommendations.\n\t </p>\n
