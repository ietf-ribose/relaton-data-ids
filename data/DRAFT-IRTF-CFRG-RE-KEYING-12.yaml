abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when\n
    \  encryption is performed under a single key.  This amount is called\n   \"key
    lifetime\".  This specification describes a variety of methods to\n   increase
    the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides two types of\n   re-keying mechanisms
    based on hash functions and on block ciphers,\n   that can be used with modes
    of operations such as CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB\n   and OMAC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
