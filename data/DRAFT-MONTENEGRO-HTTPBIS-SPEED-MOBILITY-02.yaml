abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes \"HTTP Speed+Mobility,\" a proposal
    for HTTP\n   2.0 that emphasizes performance improvements and security while at\n
    \  the same time accounting for the important needs of mobile devices\n   and
    applications.  The proposal starts from both the Google SPDY\n   protocol and
    the work the IETF has done around WebSockets.  The\n   proposal is not a final
    product but rather is intended to form a\n   baseline for working group discussion.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
