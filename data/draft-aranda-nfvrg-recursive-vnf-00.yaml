abstract:
- content: "<p>Current efforts in the scope of Network Function Virtualisation(NFV)
    propose YAML-based descriptors for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). These descriptors
    are human-readable but hardly understandable by humans. On the other hand, there
    has been an effort proposed to the IETF to define a human-readable (and understandable)
    representation for networks, known as NEMO. In this draft, we propose a simple
    extension to NEMO to accomodate VNFDs in a similar manner as inline assembly is
    integrated in higher-level programming languages. This approach enables the creation
    of recursive VNF forwarding graphs in Service Descriptors, practically making
    them recursive.</p>"
