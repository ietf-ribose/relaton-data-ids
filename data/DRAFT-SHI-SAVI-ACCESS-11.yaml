abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet is always confronted with many security threats based
    on IP\n   address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic\n
    \  redirection. Unfortunately, the Internet architecture fails to\n   provide
    the defense mechanism. Source Address Validation Improvement\n   (SAVI) was developed
    to prevent IP source address spoofing.\n   Especially, the mechanism is essential
    for ISPs. However, due to the\n   diversity of address assignment methods, SAVI
    solution is also\n   different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios
    of\n   ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements\n
    \  and tentative solutions accordingly.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
