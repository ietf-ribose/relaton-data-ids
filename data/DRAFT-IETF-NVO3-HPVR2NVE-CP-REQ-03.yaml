abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a Split-NVE architecture, the functions of the NVE are split\n
    \  across a server and an external network equipment which is called an\n   external
    NVE.  The server-resident control plane functionality\n   resides in control software,
    which may be part of a hypervisor or\n   container management software; for simplicity,
    this draft refers to\n   the hypervisor as the location of this software.\n\n
    \  A control plane protocol(s) between a hypervisor and its associated\n   external
    NVE(s) is used for the hypervisor to distribute its virtual\n   machine networking
    state to the external NVE(s) for further handling.\n   This document illustrates
    the functionality required by this type of\n   control plane signaling protocol
    and outlines the high level\n   requirements. Virtual machine states as well as
    state transitioning\n   are summarized to help clarifying the needed protocol
    requirements.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
