abstract:
- content: "<p>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response
    with response code NXDOMAIN, it means that the name in the question section AND
    ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document
    should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing
    list. The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
    kept at Github [1].</p>"
