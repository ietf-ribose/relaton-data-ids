abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as
    a \nconsequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has \nbeen
    developed and is currently being deployed.  RFC 3471 [RFC3471]\nhas defined that
    a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) \"only has \nsignificance between two neighbors\".
    \ However, in a network composed \nof a new generation of lambda switch-capable
    equipment, this document \nexplains new models that require standardization of
    the label.  It \nhighlights new operator requirements and describes signaling
    and \nrouting extensions to satisfy those requirements. \n\nThis document is a
    companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label \nSwitching (GMPLS) signaling.
    \ It defines the Label Switching Capable \n(LSC) technology specific information
    needed when using GMPLS.\n\t </p>\n      "
