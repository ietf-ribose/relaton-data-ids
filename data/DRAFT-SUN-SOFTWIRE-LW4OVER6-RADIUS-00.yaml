abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv4-over-IPv6 tunneling transition mechanisms provide both
    IPv4 and\n   IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-\n
    \  existing period.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for\n   IPv6(DHCPv6)
    options has been extended and defined to configure\n   tunnel initiator (TI) in
    lightweight 4over6.  However, in many\n   networks, the configuration information
    are stored in Authentication\n   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while
    user configuration\n   is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through
    DHCPv6\n   protocol.  Thus AAA server as a database can be extended to establish\n
    \  and store the whole information of tunnels and help the tunnel\n   concentrator
    (TC) recover in failure.  This document defines the\n   mechanism and the Remote
    Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\n   attributes that carry TI configuration
    information from AAA server to\n   BNG and the tunnel configuration information
    from AAA server to TC.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
