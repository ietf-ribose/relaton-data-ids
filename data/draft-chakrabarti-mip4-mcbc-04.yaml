abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This specification defines a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is
    usedto negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style inthe case
    of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address moderegistration. This mechanism
    allows the mobile node to negotiatewhich type of traffic to be delivered encapsulated
    to the foreignagent while delivering other types of IP packets using directdelivery
    style. In particular, this mechanism gives the flexibilityto eliminate tunnel
    overhead in the (typically) wireless mediumbetween the mobile node and the foreign
    agent. In addition to thereduced overhead, the new mechanism makes many multicast
    andbroadcast services available to the mobile node in a much moredeterministic
    and efficient way.</p>"
