abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Address Translation has become a popular technique
    that\n   allows private addresses unregistered with Internet Assigned Number\n
    \  Authority (IANA) to be used by organizations within a private routing\n   realm.
    These private addresses must not be advertised in the public\n   Internet. Hence
    network address translator (NAT) are placed at the\n   private routing realm border
    to translate private addresses to globally\n   unique addresses and vice versa
    before packets are exchanged between\n   the disparate routing realms. These modifications
    of the packet header\n   by the NAT cause problems with the use of end-to-end
    security protocols\n   such as IPSec and DNSSEC because network address translation
    does\n   exactly what the security protocols are trying to prevent.\n \n   Host
    Network Address Translation (HNAT) and Host Network Address Port\n   Translation
    (NAPT), on the other hand, enable end hosts to carry out\n   address (and port)
    translations before applying security algorithms. To\n   make dynamic HNAT and
    HNAPT possible, three conditions are essential.\n   First, there must exist a
    way for end hosts to discover the IP address\n   of Host-NA(P)T-Server. Second,
    there must be a way for externally\n   destined packets to be routed in the private
    domain between the Host\n   -NA(P)T-Client and Host-NA(P)T-Server. Lastly, Host-NA(P)T-Client
    must\n   be able to obtain an address (and port) binding from the Host-NA(P)T\n
    \  -Server dynamically. This draft aims to address these issues to a\n   considerable
    extent. Methods suggested are by no means exhaustive in\n   coverage and implementation
    specifics may vary from vendor to vendor.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
