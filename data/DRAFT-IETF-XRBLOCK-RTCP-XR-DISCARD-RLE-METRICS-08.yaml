abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with
    the Real-\n   time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term\n
    \  and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may\n   include
    aggregate information across longer periods of time as well\n   as individual
    packet reporting.  This document specifies a per-packet\n   report metric capturing
    individual packets discarded from the de-\n   jitter buffer after successful reception.\n\n\t
