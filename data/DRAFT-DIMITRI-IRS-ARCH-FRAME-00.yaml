abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       This document details the possible architectural and design
    choices\n       in order to determine i) the spatial location of the so-called
    \"IRS\n       interface\" and the functional entities it directly and/or indirectly\n
    \      involves, ii) the number of levels of redirection between routing\n       modules
    and application (and associated identifier space), and iii)\n       the various
    constraints that can be anticipated when dealing with the\n       coupling of
    functional planes including the prevention of\n       oscillations between two
    or more routing system states, coupling\n       effects (leading to amplification
    chains) and, concurrency (leading\n       to antagonistic action-reaction).\n\n\t
