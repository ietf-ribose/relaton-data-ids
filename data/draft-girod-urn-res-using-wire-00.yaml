abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The identifier resolution extensions proposed in WIRE [11] add newmechanisms
    for redirection and resolver delegation to HTTP. While thesemechanisms are generalized
    to support resolution of all URIs, they weredesigned in part to meet the specific
    needs of URN resolution systems. This document describes how the WIRE model maintains
    consistency withexisting models of URN resolution, how WIRE can be used as a URN
    resolutionprotocol, and how WIRE fits into the existing URN resolution infrastructure,including
    NAPTR [8] and THTTP [9].</p>"
