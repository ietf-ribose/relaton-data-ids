abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document argues in favor of Internet service providers
    deploying\n   technologies which offer increased privacy to users of their\n   services.
    \ The discussion is independent of any particular privacy\n   technology.  The
    approach is to consider common objections to the the\n   deployment of such technologies,
    and show that these objections are\n   not well-founded.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
