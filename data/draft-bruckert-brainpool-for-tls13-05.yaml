abstract:
- content: "<p>ECC Brainpool curves were an option for authentication and key exchange
    in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2, but were deprecated
    by the IETF for use with TLS version 1.3 because they had little usage. There
    are no security concerns in using the ECC Brainpool Curves, and there is some
    interest in using several of these curves in TLS 1.3. This document provides the
    necessary protocol mechanisms for using ECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3. This
    approach is not endorsed by the IETF.</p>"
