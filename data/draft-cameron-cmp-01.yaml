abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the problems with terminal servers attached to a LAN is the
    large number of small packets they can generate. Frequently, most of these packets
    are destined for only one or two hosts. CMP is a protocol which allows multiple
    Telnet and Rlogin connections, between a server and a host, to share a single
    TCP connection. With simple extensions this can be expanded to include other TCP
    protocols.</p>"
