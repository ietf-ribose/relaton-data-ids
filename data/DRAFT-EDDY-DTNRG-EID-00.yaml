abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The architecture for Delay Tolerant Networking includes a type
    of\naddress called an Endpoint Identifier.  This document describes some\nof the
    remaining issues regarding Endpoint Indentifiers, and how they\ncan be configured
    and used in bundle forwarding.  These either imply\ndirections for future work
    or highlight clarifications that should be\nmade in the current architecture and
    protocol documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
