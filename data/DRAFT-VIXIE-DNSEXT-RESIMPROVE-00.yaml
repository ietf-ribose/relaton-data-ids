abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes several mechanisms which can be employed
    by\niterative caching DNS resolvers to improve resiliency, robustness,\nand responsiveness.
    \ These improvements are optional and they require\nno changes to the protocol,
    or to authority servers, or to DNS stub\nresolver clients.\n\t </p>\n      "
