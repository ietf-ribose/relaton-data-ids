abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile
    Node\n   (MN) is assigned with a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its\n
    \  initial attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration.  During\n   the
    movement of the MN, this prefix remains unchanged and in this way\n   it is unnecessary
    for the MN to reconfigure its HoA and reconnect the\n   ongoing communications.
    \ However, the current protocol (RFC5213)\n   does not specify related operations
    to support the MN to timely\n   receive and use a new HNP when the allocated HNP
    changes.  In this\n   draft, a possible solution to support the HNP renumbering
    is\n   proposed, as an update of RFC5213.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
