abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The YANG data modeling language is currently being considered
    for a\n   wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at\n
    \  large.  Many standards development organizations (SDOs), open source\n   software
    projects, vendors and users are using YANG to develop and\n   publish YANG modules
    for a wide variety of applications.  At the same\n   time, there is currently
    no well-known terminology to categorize\n   various types of YANG modules.\n\n
    \  A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of YANG\n   modules,
    assist in the analysis of the YANG data modeling efforts in\n   the IETF and other
    organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-\n   related discussions between
    the different groups.\n\n   This document describes a set of concepts and associated
    terms to\n   support consistent classification of YANG modules.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
