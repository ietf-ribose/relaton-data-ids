abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge
    for the\n   infrastructure. The targeted services and the full deployment of\n
    \  virtualization in all segments of the network will need service\n   function
    chains that previously resided in the(local and remote)\n   infrastructure of
    the Network operators to extend to the radio access\n   network (RAN).\n\n   The
    objective of this draft is to provide a non-exhaustive but\n   representative
    list of service functions in 4G and 5G networks. We\n   base on the problem statement
    [RFC 7498] and architecture framework\n   [SFC-Arch] of the working group, as
    well on the existing mobile\n   networks use cases [SFC-mobile-uc] and the requirement
    gathering\n   process of different initiatives around the world [5GPPP, IMT2020,\n
    \  5G-FK, IMT2020-CN ] to anticipate network elements that will be\n   needed
    in 5G networks.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
