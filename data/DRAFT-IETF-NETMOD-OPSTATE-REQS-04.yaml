abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document primarily regards the difference between the
    intended\n   configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how\n
    \  intended and applied configuration relate to the operational state of\n   a
    device.  This document defines requirements for the applied\n   configuration's
    data model and its values, as well as for enabling a\n   client to know when a
    configuration has been fully applied or not,\n   how to access operational state,
    and how to relate intended\n   configuration nodes to applied configuration and
    derived state nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
