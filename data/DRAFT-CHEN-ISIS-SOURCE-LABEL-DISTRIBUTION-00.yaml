abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An MPLS Source Label (SL) is defined to identify a node that
    is (one\n   of) the ingress LSRs to a specific LSP.  This document defines\n   extensions
    to ISIS protocol for distribution of the mapping of an\n   MPLS Source Label to
    an specific LSR.  Therefore, the egress and\n   intermediate LSRs can determine
    from which LSR an MPLS packet is\n   sent.\n\n   This document also defines ISIS
    extensions to advertise the Source\n   Label Capability (SLC) of each LSR that
    indicates whether an LSR can\n   process the Source Label.  With the SLC, an ingress
    LSR can determine\n   whether it is allowed to insert a Source Label into the
    label stack\n   for a specific LSP.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
