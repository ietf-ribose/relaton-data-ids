abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In PIM-SM shared LAN networks, there is typically more than
    one\n   upstream router. When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN from\n
    \  different routers, assert packets are sent from these routers to\n   elect
    a single forwarder. The PIM assert packets are sent\n   periodically to keep the
    assert state. The PIM assert packet carries\n   information about a single multicast
    source and group, along with the\n   metric-preference and metric of the route
    towards the source or RP.\n   This document defines a standard to send and receive
    multiple\n   multicast source and group information in a single PIM assert packet\n
    \  in a shared network. This can be particularly helpful when there is\n   traffic
    for a large number of multicast groups.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
