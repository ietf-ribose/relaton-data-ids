abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mathematical Mesh is a Threshold Key Infrastructure that
    makes\n   computers easier to use by making them more secure.  Application of\n
    \  threshold cryptography to key generation and use enables users to\n   make
    use of public key cryptography across multiple devices with\n   minimal impact
    on the user experience.\n\n   This document provides an overview of the Mesh data
    structures,\n   protocols and examples of its use.\n\n   [Note to Readers] Discussion
    of this draft takes place on the\n   MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org),
    which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.\n\n
