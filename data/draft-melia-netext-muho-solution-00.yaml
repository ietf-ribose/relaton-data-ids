abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order tosupport
    multihomed mobile nodes (MN). These extensions are intendedto permit such mobile
    nodes to send and receive IP packets onmultiple interfaces in a simultaneous and
    possibly discriminatedmanner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical usage
    of theseextensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination throughmultiple
    interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MNinterface to VOIP traffic
    and another MN interface to HTTP traffic).The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt
    to increment in a backwardcompatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.
    In additionthese extensions use, when possible, existing specifications relatedto
    multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statementof Netext Working
    Group.</p>"
