abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the callingdevice
    has acquired rights to use the access network or that noauthentication is required
    for the access network, such as for publicwireless access points. Subsequent protocol
    interactions, such asobtaining location information, learning the address of the
    PublicSafety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself arelargely decoupled
    from the underlying network access procedures.In some cases, the device does not
    have credentials for networkaccess, does not have a VoIP provider or application
    service provider(ASP), or the credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the
    userhas exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has expired.This document
    provides a problem statement, introduces terminologyand describes an extension
    for the base IETF emergency servicesarchitecture to address these scenarios.</p>"
