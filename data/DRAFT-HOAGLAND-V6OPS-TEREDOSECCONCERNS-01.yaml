abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Additional security concerns with Teredo are documented, beyond
    what\n   is in RFC 4380.  This is based on an independent analysis of Teredo's\n
    \  security implications.  The primary intent of this document is to\n   provide
    information and recommendations to the IETF that can be used\n   in any updated
    Teredo specification.  The second intended audience is\n   anyone that can help
    improve security in Teredo as deployed, so they\n   will be aware of these concerns.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
