abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP]
    search\noperation to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client can\nreceive
    notification of changes that occur in an LDAP server.  The\nmechanism is designed
    to be very flexible yet easy for clients and\nservers to implement.  Since the
    IETF is likely to pursue a different,\nmore comprehensive solution in this area,
    this document will eventually\nbe published with Informational status in order
    to document an existing\npractice.\n\t </p>\n      "
