abstract:
  content: "<p>The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that arerobust,
    easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy tocompute. The IPPM WG has
    defined a large number of richlyparameterized metrics because network measurement
    has many purposes.Often, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of metricsdescribing
    a network's state to an end user. It is for this purposethat the present set of
    metrics is defined.</p>"
