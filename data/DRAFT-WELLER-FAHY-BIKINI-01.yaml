abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BikINI is designed to allow multiple client computers to access
    a\nmail message store on a central server. It operates over any\nreliable datastream
    protocol, but is commonly used over TCP. BikINI\nis designed to require minimal
    message parsing by the server, to be\n8-bit clean for mail message content, and
    to be a lighter-weight and\neasier-to-implement than other remote message access
    protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
