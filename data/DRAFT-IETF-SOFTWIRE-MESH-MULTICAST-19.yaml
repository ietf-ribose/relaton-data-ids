abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During IPv6 transition, there will be scenarios where a backbone\n
    \  network running one IP address family internally (referred to as\n   internal
    IP or I-IP), while the attached client networks running\n   another IP address
    family (referred to as external IP or E-IP).  The\n   I-IP backbone should offer
    both unicast and multicast transit\n   services to the client E-IP networks.\n\n
    \  This document describes the mechanism for supporting multicast across\n   a
    set of E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwire mesh.  The\n   document focuses
    on IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, due to lack of real-\n   world use cases for IPv6-over-IPv4
    scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
