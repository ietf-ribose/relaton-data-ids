abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL active-active access, an RPF check failure issue may
    occur\n   when using the pseudo-nickname mechanism specified in RFC 7781. This\n
    \  draft describes a solution to resolve this RPF check failure issue\n   through
    centralized replication. All ingress RBridges send BUM\n   (Broadcast, Unknown
    unicast and Mutlicast) traffic to a centralized\n   node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.
    When the centralized node\n   receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets
    and forwards\n   them to their destination RBridges using a distribution tree\n
    \  established as per TRILL base protocol RFC 6325. To avoid RPF check\n   failure
    on a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge and the\n   centralized replication
    node, some change in the RPF calculation\n   algorithm is required. RPF checks
    on each RBridge should be\n   calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress
    RBridge,\n   instead of being calculated using the actual ingress RBridge.\n\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
