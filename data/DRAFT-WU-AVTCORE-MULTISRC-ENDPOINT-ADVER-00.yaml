abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When two endpoints with multiple media sources are in communication,\n
    \  each media source or each receiver within either endpoint may send or\n   receive
    reception report independently.  This may incur a lot of\n   duplicated reception
    report to and from the endpoint with multiple\n   sources.  This document discusses
    how to tackle these problems and\n   propose three phases for suppressing reception
    reports.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
