abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies how the level 3 multihoming Shim6 protocol
    (Shim6) detects failures between two communicating nodes. It also specifies an
    exploration protocol for switching to another pair of interfaces and/or addresses
    between the same nodes if a failure occurs and an operational pair can be found.
