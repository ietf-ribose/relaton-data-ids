abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs)
    by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface oftype MANET. This document
    describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop broadcast network, which is a special
    case of a MANET in whicheach router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.
    Unlike anOSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different costassociated
    with each neighbor. The document includes configurationrecommendations and simplified
    mechanisms that can be used in single-hop networks.</p>"
