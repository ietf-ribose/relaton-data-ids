abstract:
- content: "<p>The intentions for the IPv6 host configuration design, was to configure
    the core network layer parameters with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery for
    other configuration parameters. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out as planned,
    and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options are requested
    in RAs and in DHCP. This document proposes an a new universal option, formatted
    in JSON. The list of elements are maintained in an IANA registry, with greatly
    relaxed rules for registration.</p>"
