abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to\n
    \  facilitate the high-quality and persistent identification of\n   information
    objects.  A founding principle of the ARK is that\n   persistence is purely a
    matter of service and is neither inherent in\n   an object nor conferred on it
    by a particular naming syntax.  The\n   best that an identifier can do is to lead
    users to the services that\n   support robust reference.  The term ARK itself
    refers both to the\n   scheme and to any single identifier that conforms to it.
    \ An ARK has\n   five components:\n\n   [https://NMA/]ark:[/]NAAN/Name[Qualifiers]\n\n
    \  an optional and mutable Name Mapping Authority (usually a hostname),\n   the
    \"ark:\" label, the Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN), the\n   assigned Name,
    and an optional and possibly mutable Qualifier\n   supported by the NMA.  The
    NAAN and Name together form the immutable\n   persistent identifier for the object
    independent of the URL hostname.\n   An ARK is a special kind of URL that connects
    users to three things:\n   the named object, its metadata, and the provider's
    promise about its\n   persistence.  When entered into the location field of a
    Web browser,\n   the ARK leads the user to the named object.  That same ARK, inflected\n
    \  by appending `?info', returns a metadata record that is both human-\n   and
    machine-readable.  The returned record contains core metadata and\n   a commitment
    statement from the current provider.  Tools exist for\n   minting, binding, and
    resolving ARKs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
