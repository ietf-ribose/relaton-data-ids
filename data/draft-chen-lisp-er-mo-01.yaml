abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a mechanism of providing mapping service
    forLISP-like architecture. The mapping service comprises of EID Router(ER) mechanism
    and supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO), in whichER mechanism is for reducing
    forwarding entries in routers whiledriving the packets to the destination through
    tunnels, and the DHTMO serves as a supplement that provides specific mappings
    to reducethe number of tunnels. The mechanism is flexibly deployable for ISPssince
    it costs little and is easy to progress.</p>"
