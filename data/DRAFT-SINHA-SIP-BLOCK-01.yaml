abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This document defines a new response code, 4XX(Blocked),
    for the\n     Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This response code can be\n
    \    used by User Agent Client (UAC) that intentionally does not want\n     to
    have session with an incoming request from another user with\n     particular
    SIP services.  For example UAC does not want to\n     establish a session with
    an incoming request for video\n     conference from particular domain.  The existing
    mechanisms in\n     SIP do not provide any such facility to refuse a request based\n
    \    request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), SIP application,\n     media type
    or other SIP services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
