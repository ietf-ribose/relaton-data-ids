abstract:
- content: "<p>A Stateful PCE maintains information about LSP characteristics and
    resource usage within the network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations
    for its associated PCCs. This document describes general considerations for stateful
    PCEP and examines its applicability and benefits through a number of use cases.
    PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</p>"
