abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a pledge to an owner,
    using an intermediary node between pledge and owner. This intermediary node is
    known as a "constrained Join Proxy". This document extends the work of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
    by replacing the Circuit- proxy by a stateless constrained (CoAP) Join Proxy.
    It transports join traffic from the pledge to the Registrar without requiring
    per- client state.</p>
