abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of this proposal is to introduce the notion of
    network\n   identifier (NI) in the ICN architecture.  This is in addition to the\n
    \  existing names (i.e., content identifiers, CIs, or application\n   identifiers,
    AIs, in general) that are currently used for both naming\n   and routing/forwarding
    purposes.  Network identifiers are needed\n   considering the requirements on
    future networking architectures such\n   as: (i) to support persistent names (or
    persistently named objects)\n   and large-scale and high-speed mobility of any
    network entity (i.e,\n   devices, services, and content), (ii) to accommodate
    different types\n   of Internet of Things (IoT) services, many of which require
    low-\n   latency performance, and enabling edge computing to support service\n
    \  virtualization, which will require support for large scale migration\n   and
    replication of named resources, and (iii) to scale the ICN\n   architecture to
    future Internet scale considering the exponentially\n   increasing named entities.
    \ These considerations also require\n   enabling a network based name resolution
    service for efficient and\n   scalable routing.\n\n   In the current draft, we
    begin by highlighting the issues associated\n   with ICN networking when utilizing
    only the AIs, which include\n   persistently named content, services, and devices.
    \ Next we discuss\n   the function NI serves, and provide a discussion on the
    two current\n   NI-based proposals, along with their scope and functionalities.
    \ This\n   is with the objective of having a single NI construct for ICN that
    is\n   flexible enough to adapt to different networking contexts.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
