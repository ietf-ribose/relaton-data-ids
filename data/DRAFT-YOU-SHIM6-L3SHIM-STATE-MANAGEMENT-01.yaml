abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposed vertical layered communication method; especially
    \nit is mechanism to notify locator changing from L3Shim to TCP layer. \nIn this
    draft, it is called indirect TCP congestion control. This \nmechanism make TCP
    congestion situation using behavior of L3Shim \nlayer without correcting conventional
    TCP. And then we describe \nL3Shim state through the event. These kinds of events
    and progress \nstate are presented in a single system view. And it will be help
    to \nimplement L3Shim functionality through understanding L3Shim process.\n\t
