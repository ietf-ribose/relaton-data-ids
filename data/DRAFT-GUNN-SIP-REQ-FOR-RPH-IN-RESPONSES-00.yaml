abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority Header\n(RPH),
    in its current form, is ignored in SIP responses.  This was \na design choice
    during RFC 4412's development. This is now \nconsidered a bad design choice in
    certain scenarios. The Internet \nDraft \"Allowing SIP Resource Priority Header
    in SIP Responses\" \n(draft-polk-sip-rph-in-responses-00) describes a modification
    to \nRFC4412 to permit RPH in responses. This document describes one of \nthe
    requirements associated with systems using RPH, that could be \nsatisfied by the
    modification of RFC 4412 to permit RPH on \nresponses, and is not easily met by
    other methods. This ID provides\n additional motivation for SIP RPH in Responses.\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t </p>\n      "
