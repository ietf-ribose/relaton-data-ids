abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a number of environments, a component external to a network
    is\n   called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and\n
    \  current state of the connections within the network, including\n   traffic
    engineering information.  This is information typically\n   distributed by IGP
    routing protocols within the network\n\n   This document describes a mechanism
    by which links state and traffic\n   engineering information can be collected
    from networks and shared\n   with external components using the BGP routing protocol.
    \ This is\n   achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information\n
    \  (NLRI) encoding format.  The mechanism is applicable to physical and\n   virtual
    links.  The mechanism described is subject to policy control.\n\n   Applications
    of this technique include Application Layer Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) servers,
    and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
