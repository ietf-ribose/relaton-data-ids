    that allows RESTCONF client to configure newly deployed devices with just its
    preconfigured initial state (i.e., factory default settings) during zero touch
    bootstrapping process or restore the configuration to its preconfigured initial
    state or system restore point either during device rooting process or at the time
    of system fatal error or malfunction.</p>"
