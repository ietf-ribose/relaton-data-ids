abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new URL scheme, 'eid'.  This scheme provides\na
    mechanism by which the local application can reference data that\nhas been obtained
    by other, non-URL scheme means.  The scheme is\nintended to provide a general
    escape mechanism to allow access to\ninformation for applications that are too
    specialized to justify\ntheir own schemes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
