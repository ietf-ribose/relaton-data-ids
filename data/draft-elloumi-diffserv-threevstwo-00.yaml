abstract:
  content: "<p>This informational memo points out advantages of using three dropprecedences
    (compared to two) in the Assured Forwarding (AF) Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) when the
    traffic is composed of responsive TCP andnon responsive UDP traffic. Our simulation
    results show that whiletwo drop precedences can, in some cases, guarantee to an
    aggregateconsisting of TCP traffic the full utilization of the reservedbandwidth,
    they cannot allow to access the unreserved bandwidth inthe presence of high bit
    rate unresponsive UDP traffic. When threedrop precedences are appropriately used
    TCP aggregates can fully usethe minimum reserved bandwidth and share the unreserved
    one.</p>"
