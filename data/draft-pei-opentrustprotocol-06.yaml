abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP), a protocol
    to install, update, and delete applications in a Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE) and to manage their security configuration. TEEs are used in environments
    where security services should be isolated from a regular operating system (often
    called rich OS). This form of compartmentlization grants a smaller codebase access
    to security sensitive services and restricts communication from the rich OS to
    those security services via mediated access.</p>"
