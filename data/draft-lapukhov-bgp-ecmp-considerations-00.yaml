abstract:
- content: <p>BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking logic
    to elect single best path among multiple possible. At the same time, it has been
    common in virtually all BGP implementations to allow for "equal-cost multipath"
    (ECMP) election and programming of multiple next-hops in routing tables. This
    documents summarizes some common considerations for the ECMP logic, with the intent
    of providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized feature.</p>
