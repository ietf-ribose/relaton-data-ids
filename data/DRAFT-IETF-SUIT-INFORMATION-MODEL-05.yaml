abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have
    raised the\n   need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also\n
    \  suitable for constrained devices.  Ensuring that devices function and\n   remain
    secure over their service life requires such an update\n   mechanism to fix vulnerabilities,
    to update configuration settings,\n   as well as adding new functionality\n\n
    \  One component of such a firmware update is a concise and machine-\n   processable
    meta-data document, or manifest, that describes the\n   firmware image(s) and
    offers appropriate protection.  This document\n   describes the information that
    must be present in the manifest.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
