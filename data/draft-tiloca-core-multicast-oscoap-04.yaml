abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for protecting group communication
    over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The proposed approach relies
    on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) and the CBOR
    Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) format. All security requirements fulfilled
    by OSCORE are maintained for multicast OSCORE request messages and related OSCORE
    response messages. Source authentication of all messages exchanged within the
    group is ensured, by means of digital signatures produced through private keys
    of sender devices and embedded in the protected CoAP messages.</p>"
