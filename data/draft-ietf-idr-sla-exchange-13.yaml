abstract:
- content: "<p>Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service (QoS) policies
    according to Traffic Conditioning Agreement (TCA) with their providers. The enforcement
    of such policies often relies upon vendor-specific configuration language. Both
    learning of TCA, either thru TCA documents or via some other out-of-band method,
    and translating them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, often
    manual, process and prone to errors. This document specifies an optional transitive
    attribute to signal TCA parameters in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered
    as Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplifying and facilitating some of the complex
    provisioning tasks in situations where BGP is available as a routing protocol.</p>"
