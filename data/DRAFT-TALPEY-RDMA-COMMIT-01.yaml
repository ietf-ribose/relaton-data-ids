abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies extensions to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory\n
    \  Access) protocols to provide capabilities in support of enhanced\n   remotely-directed
    data placement on persistent memory-addressable\n   devices.  The extensions include
    new operations supporting remote\n   commitment to persistence of remotely-managed
    buffers, which can\n   provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for
    low-latency\n   storage applications.  In addition to, and in support of these,\n
    \  extensions to local behaviors are described, which may be used to\n   guide
    implementation, and to ease adoption.  This document updates\n   RFC5040 (Remote
    Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP)) and updates\n   RFC7306 (RDMA Protocol
    Extensions).\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
