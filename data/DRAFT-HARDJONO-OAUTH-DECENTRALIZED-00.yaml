abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an alternative service architecture
    for user-\n   centric control of the sharing of resources, such as personal data,\n
    \  using the decentralized peer-to-peer computing paradigm.  The term\n   'control'
    is used here to denote the full capacity of the user to\n   freely select (i)
    the entities with whom to share resources (e.g.\n   data), and (ii) the entities
    which provide services implementing\n   user-controlled resource sharing.  The
    peer-to-peer service\n   architecture uses a set of computing nodes called OAuth2.0
    Nodes (ON)\n   that are part of a peer-to-peer network as the basis for the\n
    \  decentralized service architecture.  Each OAuth2.0 Nodes is assumed\n   to
    have the capability to provide AS-services, RS-services and\n   Client-services.\n\n\n\t
