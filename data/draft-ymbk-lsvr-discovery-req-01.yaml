abstract:
- content: "<p>For wide scale routing protocols to build their topology and reachability
    databases they need link neighbor discovery, link encapsulation data, and layer
    two liveness. BGP-LS and its enhancements provide an API to present much of these
    data to BGP protocols, but do not actually collect these data. This document explores
    the needs and criteria for the data needed.</p>"
