abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a fundamental component for a routing system. It depends on
    the flooding mechanism to advertise and synchronize link-state database among
    distributed nodes in the network. As modern networks become larger and more complex,
    lots of nodes and adjacencies are involved into it. As a result, massive link-state
    information are generated and synchronized which is becoming an overhead of the
    network nowadays. This document proposes a new design of OSPF database synchronization
    which is slightly different from the one stated in OSPF. This new design can help
    to alleviate the overhead by dividing OSPF routers into independent synchronization
    groups and forbidding synchronization across the group border. Since less burden
    from synchronization, it is possible to accommodate more OSPF routers and adjacencies
    in the network.</p>"
