abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performances
    of provisioning Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Generalized MPLS or MPLS-TE networks.
    When Generalized MPLS/MPLS-TE is used to provision LSPs, it is useful to record
    the performance of the provisioning process, such as the delay in creating and
    deleting the LSPs. The managed information may be retrieved by the Management
    System and visualized on the GUI, so that the performance of dynamic provisioning
    may be monitored in a timely manner. This work is a continuation of the work in
    [RFC5814] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dpm], where the provisioning performance values
    are obtained through active measurements.</p>"
