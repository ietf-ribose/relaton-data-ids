abstract:
  content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means of personal,
    terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. Thisdocument describes two
    schemes for supporting service mobility in aSIP environment. The first assumes
    that call states are maintainedand stored within the network and home network
    always controls callsand services of its subscribers. The second assumes that
    call statesare stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed in a distributedmanner,
    and the visited network controls users' calls and services.</p>"
