abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 allowing the
    \nefficient establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of \nmobile
    receivers moving to access networks with unidirectional links.\nScenarios are
    derived from the need to support seamless mobile\nin heterogeneous networking
    environment including unidirectional \ndownstream link interfaces, such as DVB-H,
    DVB-T, DVB-S or \nsatellites.   \n\nIn order to establish quickly the upstream
    connectivity of a mobile \nreceiver, when moving to downstream unidirectional
    network in MIPv6 \nenvironment, the Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms defined in
    \nRFC 3077 are used in interaction with Mobile IPv6 protocols.  \n\t </p>\n      "
