abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for information related to the Fabric Configuration
    Server function of a Fibre Channel network. At present, this memo is a work item
    of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is that it will later be a work item of
    the IETF's IMSS working group.</p>"
