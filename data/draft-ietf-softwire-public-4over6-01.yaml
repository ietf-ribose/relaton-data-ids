abstract:
- content: "<p>When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, IPv4 connectivity
    will still be demanded by network users, at least in the recent future. This draft
    proposes a mechanism for end hosts or networks in IPv6 access networks to build
    bidirectional IPv4 communication with the IPv4 Internet. The mechanism follows
    the softwire hub and spoke model, and uses IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method
    to traverse IPv6 network. The bi-directionality of end-to-end communication is
    achieved by allocating public IPv4 addresses to end hosts/networks. This mechanism
    is an IPv4 access method for network users in IPv6.</p>"
