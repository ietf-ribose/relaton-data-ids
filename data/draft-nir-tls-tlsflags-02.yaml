abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that carry
    no interesting information except the 1-bit indication that a certain optional
    feature is supported. Such extensions take 4 octets each. This document defines
    a flags extension that can provide such indications at an average marginal cost
    of 1 bit each. More precisely, it provides as many flag extensions as needed at
    4 + the order of the last set bit divided by 8.</p>"
