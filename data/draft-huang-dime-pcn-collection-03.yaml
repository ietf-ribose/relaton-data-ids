abstract:
  content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoSfor
    inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain. The PCN architecturerequires that egress
    nodes send regular reports of PCN-definedmeasurements to a decision point. It
    requires further that thedecision point occasionally be able to request certain
    measurementsfrom ingress nodes. The decision point can be located in differentplaces
    in the network. This memo defines a Diameter application tosupport communications
    between the ingress and egress nodes and aDiameter server acting as a PCN decision
    point.</p>"
