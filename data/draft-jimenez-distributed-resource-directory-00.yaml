abstract:
- content: "<p>In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient to offer non-centralized alternatives
    for discovery and rendezvous. This document defines a Distributed Resource Directory
    (DRD) for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Distribution is achieved by
    means of a structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay. The DHT-based P2P overlay provides
    discovery, rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points as well as HTTP
    proxy service for Web clients.</p>"
