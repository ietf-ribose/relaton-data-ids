abstract:
- content: "<p>Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG data
    models to encode policy, which will point to device-, technology-, and service-specific
    YANG models developed in other working groups. Policy rules within an operator's
    environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide policies
    to a network management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network
    element). The network management function can then control the configuration and/or
    monitoring of network elements and services. This document describes the SUPA
    basic framework, its elements and interfaces.</p>"
