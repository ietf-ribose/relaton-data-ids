abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the framework of a fast reroute mechanism
    for\n   protecting IP/MPLS services and MPLS transport tunnels against egress\n
    \  node and egress link failures.  In this framework, the penultimate-\n   hop
    router of an MPLS tunnel acts as the point of local repair (PLR)\n   for egress
    node failure, and the egress router of the MPLS tunnel\n   acts as the PLR for
    egress link failure.  They each pre-establishes a\n   bypass tunnel to a protector.
    \ Upon an egress node or link failure,\n   the PLR performs local failure detection
    and local repair, by\n   rerouting packets over the bypass tunnel.  The protector
    in turn\n   performs context label switching or context IP forwarding to send
    the\n   packets to ultimate service destination(s).  This mechanism can be\n   used
    to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the\n   failure and control
    plane protocols converge on the topology changes\n   due to the failure.  The
    framework is applicable to all types of IP/\n   MPLS services and MPLS tunnels.
    \ Under the framework, service\n   protocol extensions may be further specified
    to support service label\n   distribution to protector.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
