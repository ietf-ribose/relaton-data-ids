abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> The ALTO service provides the information, which can make\n   communication
    between applications more efficient, especially in case\n   of overlay applications.
    \ Such applications can use the information\n   to perform better-than-random
    peer selection.  The ALTO protocol\n   conveys network information to applications.
    \ The protocol definition\n   of this document extends the functionality of this
    ALTO service by\n   introducing a standardized manner of communications between
    ALTO\n   servers.  A new inter-ALTO protocol is proposed, which enables the\n
    \  exchange of information between ALTO servers.  The servers can\n   coordinate
    actions and can introduce policies, which provide\n   communication between applications
    localized in cooperating\n   Autonomous Systems with a higher performance and
    a better cost\n   efficiency.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
