abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As increasing number of tunnels are deployed in a Provider core,\nthere
    is a need for improving the efficiency and ease of tunnel\nestablishment.  OSPF
    running as the IGP in a Provider core, can act\nas the signalling agent for the
    Tunnel endpoints. OSPF can carry\ntunnel endpoint information in the intra-AS
    scope, easing BGP of the\nextra burden of signalling within the core.\n\t </p>\n
