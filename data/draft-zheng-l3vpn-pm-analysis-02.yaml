abstract:
- content: "<p>To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics
    on a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific ingress
    VRF a packet belongs to. But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
    (MP2MP) network model applies, flow identifying is a big challenge. This document
    summarizes the current performance monitoring mechanisms for L3VPN in MPLS networks,
    and analyzes various solutions and challenges for measuring performance metrics
    within these networks. This document also identifies various key points which
    needs to be taken in consideration when designing L3VPN performance monitoring
    mechanisms. Performance measurements within non-MPLS L3VPN networks is not within
    the scope of the document.</p>"
