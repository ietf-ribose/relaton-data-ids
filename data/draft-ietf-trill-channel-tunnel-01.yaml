abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    includes an optional mechanism, called RBridge Channel and specified in RFC 7178,
    for the transmission of typed messages between TRILL switches in the same campus
    and between TRILL switches and end stations on the same link. This document specifies
    optional extensions to RBridge Channel that provides three facilities: (1) A mechanism
    to send such messages between a TRILL switch and an end station in either direction,
    or between two end stations, when the two devices are in the same campus but not
    on the same link; (2) A method to support security facilities for RBridge Channel
    messages; and (3) A method to tunnel a variety of payload types by encapsulating
    them in an RBridge Channel message. This document updates RFC 7178.</p>"
