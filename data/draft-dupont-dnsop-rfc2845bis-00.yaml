abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol allows for transaction level authentication using shared
    secrets and one way hashing. It can be used to authenticate dynamic updates as
    coming from an approved client, or to authenticate responses as coming from an
    approved recursive name server. No provision has been made here for distributing
    the shared secrets: it is expected that a network administrator will statically
    configure name servers and clients using some out of band mechanism such as sneaker-net
    until a secure automated mechanism for key distribution is available. This document
    includes revised original TSIG specifications (RFC2845) and the extension for
    HMAC-SHA (RFC4635).</p>"
