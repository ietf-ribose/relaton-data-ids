abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a syntax and semantics as an extension
    of the\n   Internet Message Format (e-mail message) allowing a Sending User of\n
    \  an e-mail message to express his or her preference for how the\n   message
    content is to be handled by the Receiving Users.  For this\n   purpose, semantics
    of sets of different character combinations\n   (\"Privicons\") are described.
    \ These can syntactically be integrated\n   either in the first-line of the body,
    in the subject line and/or in a\n   dedicated header of any e-mail message.  The
    Privicons icon set\n   consists of six different icons.  They will be machine-readable.
    \ The\n   Privicons concept is partly borrowing its approach from the concept\n
    \  of emoticons.  For example, to express that the content may be\n   forwarded
    and even be published.  The Sending User could use the\n   Privicon \"[&gt;]\",
    which may be followed by an additional explanations,\n   such as \"please share\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
