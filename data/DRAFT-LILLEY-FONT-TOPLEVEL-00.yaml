    Content\n   Type, under which the Internet Media subtypes for representation\n
    \  formats for fonts may be registered.  This document also serves as a\n   registration
    application for a set of intended subtypes, which are\n   representative of some
    existing subtypes already registered under the\n   \"application\" tree by their
    separate registrations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
