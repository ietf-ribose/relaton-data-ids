abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides for an extension to RFC 8520 that allows MUD file
    authors to specify ownership and licensing of MUD files themselves. This memo
    updates RFC 8520. However, it can also be used for purposes outside of MUD, and
    the grouping is structured as such.</p>"
