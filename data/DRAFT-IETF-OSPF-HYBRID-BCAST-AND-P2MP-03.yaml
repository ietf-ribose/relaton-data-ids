abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network
    as a\n   hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of\n
    \  OSPF operation.  Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as LSA\n   database
    synchronization are performed using the broadcast model, but\n   the network is
    represented using the point-to-multipoint model in the\n   router LSAs of the
    routers connected to it.  This allows an accurate\n   representation of the cost
    of communication between different routers\n   on the network, while maintaining
    the network efficiency of broadcast\n   operation.  This approach is relatively
    simple and requires minimal\n   changes to OSPF.\n\n   This document updates both
    OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
