abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol\nestablishes
    core-base tree to forward multicast datagrams in a\nnetwork.  In PIM-SM, the core
    or Rendezvous Point (RP) of a group is\ndetermined at each multicast router by
    hashing a group address, i.e.,\na class-D IP address, to one of the candidate
    RPs.  The hash function\nis characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely
    choose the\ncore for a group and remains insensitive to the geographic\ndistribution
    of the group members and the sources.  However, it may\nresult in a multicast
    tree with high cost.\nThis draft presents a relocation mechanism which is extension
    to PIM-\nSM, in which RP could be relocated periodically.  When a new RP is\nfound,
    the original RP informs all members to re-join to the new RP.\n\t </p>\n      "
