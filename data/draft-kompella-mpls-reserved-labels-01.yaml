abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a limited number of reserved labels defined for Multi- Protocol
    Label Switching. Thus one must be cautious in the allocation of new reserved labels,
    yet at the same time allow forward progress when a new reserved label is called
    for. This memo suggests some procedures to follow in the allocation and retirement
    of reserved labels.</p>"
