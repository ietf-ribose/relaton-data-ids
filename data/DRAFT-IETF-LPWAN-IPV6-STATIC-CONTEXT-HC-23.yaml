abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC)\n   framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an\n
    \  optional fragmentation mechanism.  SCHC has been designed for Low\n   Power
    Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).\n\n   SCHC compression is based on a common static
    context stored both in\n   the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure
    side.  This\n   document defines a generic header compression mechanism and its\n
    \  application to compress IPv6/UDP headers.\n\n   This document also specifies
    an optional fragmentation and reassembly\n   mechanism.  It can be used to support
    the IPv6 MTU requirement over\n   the LPWAN technologies.  Fragmentation is needed
    for IPv6 datagrams\n   that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was
    not\n   possible, still exceed the layer-2 maximum payload size.\n\n   The SCHC
    header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are\n   independent of the specific
    LPWAN technology over which they are\n   used.  This document defines generic
    functionalities and offers\n   flexibility with regard to parameter settings and
    mechanism choices.\n   This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN
    between two\n   SCHC entities.  Settings and choices specific to a technology
    or a\n   product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified\n
    \  in other documents.  Data models for the context and profiles are out\n   of
    scope.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
