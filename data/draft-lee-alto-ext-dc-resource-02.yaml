abstract:
- content: <p>In a networked application environment where resources (e.g., computing,
    storage, etc.) are geographically distributed in Data Centers, a key decision
    is to allocate the application request to an "optimal" Data Center location in
    which to host the application request. Key constraints in this decision include
    resource availability, network cost, infrastructure constraints (e.g., power)
    and others. This draft proposes an ALTO extension to support data center resource
    information model and its related protocol extensions.</p>
