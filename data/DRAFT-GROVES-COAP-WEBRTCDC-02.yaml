abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The WebRTC framework defines a generic transport service allowing\n
    \  WEB-browsers and other endpoints to exchange generic data from peer\n   to
    peer utilizing a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\n   transport.  This
    service is known as Web Real Time Communication\n   WebRTC data channels (WebRTC
    DC).  The use of WebRTC DCs for the\n   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    allows WebRTC enabled devices\n   to exchange CoAP data between peers in a secure
    reliable manner.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
