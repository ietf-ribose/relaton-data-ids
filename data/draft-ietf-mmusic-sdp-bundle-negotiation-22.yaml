abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the SDP
    Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single address:port combination
    (BUNDLE address) for receiving media, referred to as bundled media, associated
    with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines). To assist endpoints in negotiating
    the use of bundle this specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only',
    which can be used to request that specific media is only used if bundled. There
    are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP packets with the appropriate media
    descriptions. This specification defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that provides an
    additional way to do this correlation by using them to carry a value that associates
    the RTP/ RTCP packets with a specific media description.</p>
