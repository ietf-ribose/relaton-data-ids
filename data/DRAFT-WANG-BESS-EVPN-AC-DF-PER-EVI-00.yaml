abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The AC-influenced DF Election (AC-DF) per [RFC8584] is too
    dependent\n   on EAD/EVI routes.  For example, when no failures occured on an
    ESI,\n   that AC-DF procedures will give incorrect results if no EAD/EVI\n   routes
    are advertised.  But in some light-weighted EVPNs (i.e.  PBB\n   EVPNs), no EAD/EVI
    routes will be advertised at all.\n\n   This draft proposes some new extensions
    to support AC-influenced DF\n   Election without any EAD/EVI routes advertised
    in advance of any\n   &lt;ESI, EVI&gt; failures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
