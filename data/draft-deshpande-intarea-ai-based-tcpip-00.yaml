    Path diversity through Cloud Orchestrated\tReflectors can be implemented through
    the Wireless concepts of\tRx Diversity, Tx Diversity and MIMO (Multi-Input, Multi-Output)\tThis
    draft is more of a fundamental concept that identifies how the\tNetwork is evolving.
    This draft explains about the implicit\tlife cycle, which is also somewhat mathematical
    as it involves\tone-to-many and many-to-one function mapping between Cloud and\tNetwork
    reflectors. Then it relates the many cloud reflectors\ttogether throug\tWireless
    network technologies like Tx, Rx\tdiversity and MIMO. This draft explains how
    this can be\timplemented in Wired networks through Cloud software, path\tdiversity,
    spatial multiplexing\tand Diversity precoding.Introduction\tThis draft:\t1.Identifies
    the Big data, Digital Data bottleneck in present\tNetwork.\t2.Identifies that
    Networks are evolving from Wireless Networks\tas well as Programming.\t3. Provides
    a resolution to the Data bottleneck problem by evolving\tthe present Wired Networks
    and Cloud architectures to incorporate\tfeatures from Wireless networks and Programming.\tThis
    draft begins at a very basic level where it identifies the\tproblem\tin the M2M
    communication. John Backus (Inventor of FORTRAN\tor Formula Translation) describes
    the Von Neumann bottleneck as\tan Intellectual\tbottleneck.\tThis Intellectual
    bottleneck also affects the TCP-IP model or the\tNetworking layers. There is a
    static nature to the TCP-IP model. If\tan AI approach is chosen to understand
    the TCP-IP layers the\tproblem in M2M communication can be further classified.\tThe
    problem is that there is a duality between the state machine\tand the program
    control. However, the state machine is like a point\tvalue or a basic computational
    element. This point value links the\tstate machine to Wireless Networks through
    Mass-Energy equivalence.\t Thus the state machine comes first and then the Program
    control.\tFrom the AI based TCP-IP model and analysis of digital data it can\tbe
    seen that this duality is centred between the Internet and the\tTransport layers.\tThe
    Digital Data or Big Data is the central point around which we\tare\tbuilding a
    network architecture, therefore a design model\tsomewhat different from SDN or
    TCP-IP can be arrived at.\tThis is described through the diagrams in this draft:\t1.\tImplicit
    Lifecycle with Big Data in Centralised Control plane\tand Distributed forwarding\t2.\tImplicit
    Lifecycle between Network, Cloud and the Internet\t(aka Network of Networks).\tImpact
    on EPN (Evolved Programmable Networks):\tHaving arrived at these models we can
    understand how the Network is\tnot just evolving from Programming but is evolving
    from the M2M\tbottleneck or M2M duality. This duality has Digital data or Big\tdata
    as the central point. This digital data can be considered as\t an infinitesimal
    mass value or a finite state element.\tConsidering the implicit lifecycle and
    the mass-energy equivalence\t we can arrive at the conclusion that Networks are
    also evolving\tfirstly from Wireless Networks and then from Programming.\tAs the
    Network is evolving from both Wireless Networking as well\tas Software Programming
    we can thus find out more about the\tinter-working of the Cloud (more of a software
    based and Wireless\t concept) and the Network (Hardware based and both a Wired,\tWireless
    concept). The digital or Big data is the central\tconnecting point so it cannot
    be declassified from both the Cloud\t and the Network. Based on this analysis
    it can be seen that the\tBig Data bottleneck occurs at the Inter-AS and CSC(Carrier\tsupporting
    Carrier) level. A Network grows as we add more physical\t hosts. A Network will
    keep growing and scaling.\tThus we can predict from Wireless Network architecture
    and\tProgramming how the present Network needs to evolve (grow and\tscale) to
    merge with the Cloud Architecture.\tThrough new features described in my draft
    such as Cloud\tOrchestrated Reflectors, Network Orchestrated Reflectors,\tContext
    Mapping, Path diversity (as evolved from Wireless concepts\tsuch as Tx Diversity,
    Rx diversity and MIMO) the Big data or\tDigital data bottleneck problem in present
    Networks can be\tresolved.Description:\tThe goal is to build a Seamless cloud
    infrastructure which allows\tany CE to be seamlessly connected to the Internet
    (or SP). The\t Infrastructure would combine high speed core (data center)\t architecture
    with the Service provider and also to the end user.\t The Seamless cloud does
    not have the drawbacks of the hybrid cloud\t division that breaks down the Cloud
    into a public and a private\t cloud infrastructure. The Seamless Cloud infrastructure
    can\t provide an alternate way of building the CSC (Carrier Supporting\t Carrier)
    framework which is the present SP backbone design.\tA Distributed Intelligence
    system is more suited for the\thierarchical layered system that defines the Network.
    A centralized\tcontrol plane for the entire network may have vulnerabilities and\talso
    greatly increases the complexity. A distributed system is more\tpractical considering
    the Routing/Switching infrastructure and\tNetwork layers that we have. From an
    AI perspective this would be a\tbottoms-up approach rather than a top-down approach.\tPlease
    see below diagram of the TCP/IP model from this AI\tperspective.It is important
    to understand that the AI in a Network\tor a Cloud is centered around the Internet
    and Transport Layer\twhile still needing a Top-down approach from the Application
    layer\tand a bottoms-up approach from the Link layer. The Cisco proprietary\tparameter
    appropriately named as \"weight\" in the BGP protocol is\tsuggestive of the fact
    that the Intelligence in a Network needs to\tbe centered around the Network and
    Transport Layers. Also the term\t\"Weighted\" appears in QoS as \"Weighted Fair
    Queueing\".\tTCP/IP Layers from an AI/IoT perspective (AI Based TCP-IP Model)\t________________________________________________________________\tApplication\t|

    based FSM with IntelligentFlow in contrast to OpenFlow needs to\t be developed
    to build an AI based Network Infrastructure.\tThis FSM can form a sort of Shadow
    Router that tracks and defines\tthe\tNetwork from a bottoms-up approach.\tThe
    underlying hardware approach can assist in fast switching the\tdata as in Shortest
    path bridging.\tBasically TCP is stateful, IP is stateless and BGP is stateful.\tIntelligentFlow:
    Scaling the Data Flow\tIf an AI based FSM can somehow be sandboxed and moved between\tdevices
    (or hosts) then IntelligentFlow may be possible with the\tbottoms up and top down
    AI approach.\tFrom a programming point of view, a combination of high level and\tlow
    level programming is needed by which we can Sandbox the AI\tbased FSM between
    hosts. This calls for introducing an\tIntelligentStack as opposed to an Openstack
    within the data flow\tof the AI Based TCP/IP model. This IntelligentStack could
    work in\ttangent with the Elastic Compute Cloud of Openstack by providing\tmore
    traction over the Internet. The AI based FSM Sandbox can\toptimize the traffic
    flows by acting as Intermediary in the Data\tflow model. The Sandbox can scale
    up or reverse-scale the flows.\tThis could solve the BGP slow convergence and
    divergence problems.\tAI is like the logic behind a thought process.\tA Combinatorial
    logic is needed to combine the low level and high\tlevel languages. This combination
    can develop into a very basic\ttype of M2M Intelligence which is essential for
    IoT.\tFrom a high level programming perspective, the data type is a\tprogram construct
    and the control flow is a type of program\texecution (in a Machine).\tFrom a low
    level perspective, the AI based FSM can do the reverse\twhich is to program the
    data flow by sending the control plane\tinformation(to a Machine).\tIn other words,
    there is a duality in the M2M architecture through\tthe State Machine and the
    Program Control. This maybe the only way\tto tackle the Von Neumann Bottleneck:\tThe
    Von Neumann bottleneck was described by John Backus in his 1977\tACM Turing Award
    lecture. According to Backus:\tSurely there must be a less primitive way of making
    big changes in\tthe store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth\tthrough
    the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal\tbottleneck for the
    data traffic of a problem, but, more\timportantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck
    that has kept us tied\tto word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to
    think in\tterms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus\tprogramming
    is basically planning and detailing the enormous\ttraffic of words through the
    Von Neumann bottleneck, and much of\tthat traffic concerns not significant data
    itself, but where to\tfind it.[22][23]\tThis is contrast to the duality in the
    Cloud that is implied in the\tIntercloud Architecture. Hence according to me the
    Seamless Cloud\tcan incorporate the M2M architecture via the Network that cannot
    be\tdeclassified from the Cloud.\tThe Combinatorial logic behind the above categorization
    of a\tMachine (M2M) is that the binary or digital data is not completely\tdefined
    and can be divided into low level machine learning based\tdata (letters or numbers
    presented to Machine for reading)\tand high level Top down AI based data (checks
    inputs of letters\tor numbers against a description). The binary data gets more
    well\tdefined (turing complete?) when put into a finite state machine.\tWhen binary
    data is put into a state machine it adds value and\tthus weight into the machine.
    This is where BGP, TCP, IP protocols\tcome into the picture through the weight
    parameter and the CBWFQ in\tQoS. This is where we need to find the data based
    on the Von\tNeumann bottleneck. If this M2M Intelligence can be developed\tRobots
    can identify Objects and take actions through Proximity\tSensors. Robots can focus
    on near Objects, identify them and take\tactions. A great boost for IoT. From
    a bio-technology perspective\tthe network is akin to a nervous system controlled
    by a centralized\tNeural network. However, both distributed and centralized\tintelligence
    may be required considering the hierarchical\tdistributed layers in the legacy
    network data flow model where both\ta bottoms-up and top-down AI model is required.
    Neural networks\thave a concept called Convergence and Divergence.\tIn Networking
    the focus is mostly on convergence through routing\tprotocols. However, a divergent
    approach is also needed in order\tto meet the AI/IoT based TCP/IP model requirement.\tAs
    described above I have defined an AI Based TCP-IP model.\tThrough that model I
    explained the significance of the \"weight\"\tparameter. This allows us to define
    an Intelligent Automation\tfor Autonomous system through Cloud and Network orchestration.\tThere
    can be alternate ways of approaching Inter-AS and CSC.\tThe weight parameter is
    localized in an AS. With this being\tintroduced in Segment routing it allows dynamic
    scaling of\tsuch parameters. Thus an AS can grow or shrink. Or a Private\tAS can
    be dynamically generated. A public AS can scale, grow or\tshrink.\tIn essence
    this means adding more value and functions into AS\tnumbers through algorithms
    which can dynamically alter the\tAutonomous systems without impacting the network
    in any way.\tAutonomous systems could be further classified into Temporary and\tPermanent
    Autonomous Systems. This could serve as the mapping\tbetween Cloud and network
    resources because the network cannot\tbe declassified from the cloud. This mapping
    can form an interface\tbetween Network computing and Cloud computing.\tThis is
    rather like finding a number within a number. This\talgorithm could involve randomly
    changing numbers. Making numbers\tbig or small. However, one-to-many is not the
    same as many-to-one.\tQuantum computing with Qubits and Shor Algorithm could implement\tsuch
    an algorithm.\tThe efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of
    the\tquantum Fourier transform, and modular exponentiation by repeated\tsquarings.\tThese
    concepts of an Automated AS can be of significance in the IoT\tscenario where
    IoT devices can pe present anywhere and everywhere.\tIoT technologies like Smart
    Grid, Smart Transportation,Smart Cities\trequire a more robust and intelligent
    M2M communication.\tThis is rather oddly somewhat like APIPA in Windows but now
    at the\tAutonomous System level.\tThe M2M interface between Cloud and Network
    can be further defined\tbased on the concept of finding a number within a number.
    There is\tan element of time in-variance in the network while there is an\telement
    of time variance in the Cloud. This means that the network\tconvergence system
    needs to act as a Network Orchestrated Reflector\tbased on the ASN (Autonomous
    System number) while the Cloud needs\tto act as Cloud Orchestrated Reflector based
    on the Cloud platform\tASN (Autonomous System number). This defines the interface
    between\tthe two which in turn defines the mapping between Cloud and\tNetwork.
    Thus Fast Computing in the Cloud compensates for the slow\tcomputation in the
    Network.\tThe Network orchestrated reflector and Cloud orchestrated reflector\tdefined
    above are similar to the Route reflector but include ASN\tand other relevant features.\tThe
    loop or life cycle between the Network and Cloud reflectors can\tbe closed through
    the Segment routing and \"weight\" parameter There\tmay not really be a need for
    Quantum computing as of now to\timplement these concepts.\tThere is an Implicit
    Life cycle and need for Seamless Cloud\tInfrastructure as indicated by the diagrams
    below:\tDiagram 1: Implicit Life cycle (time bound) as the Network\tcannot be
    declassified from the Cloud (one way)\t|-----&gt; Internet -----&gt; Network -----&gt;

    Public Cloud &lt;-----------&gt; Private Cloud &lt;---------|\tBig Data analysis
    for TCP-IP:\t1. Big Data analysis in terms of Artificial Intelligence,\t Digital
    footprint, Programming and Quality. Not only in terms\t of Volume\t2. Big Data
    is the central intelligence that sits between the\tcontrol plane and the forwarding
    plane.\t3. Big Data can be considered as a centralized intelligence around\t which
    we are trying to put our concepts together. Big data is\t centered around IP,
    BGP and TCP.\t4. Big Data in terms of volume (content) drags us down to the link\tlayer.
    Concepts such as MPLS, switching take us away from Big Data.\t5. Big Data is both
    a centralized intelligence and a bottleneck.\tA Distributed intelligence approach
    is also thus mandated.\t6. Intelligent automation in the Cloud through Big Data
    (Hadoop,\t MapReduce) needs to interface with the Network at the Internet\t and
    Transport layers.\tWhat is the proof for Scale and manageability of these concepts
    ?\tBig Data is centered around TCP, IP and BGP layers. This is the\t forwarding
    path information in IGP via IBGP as well as EBGP.\tThe interconnect between EBGP
    and IBGP is through Autonomous s\tystems (ASN).\tThe slow convergence problem
    is in BGP and in IBGP.\tThis convergence issue is uncorrelated and exponential.\tHowever,
    this affects EBGP scenarios and overall Internet\tstability and scalability.\tThis
    scale problem can only be solved by options which\t take into consideration path
    diversity and matching for\t LPM (Longest Prefix Match) between Autonomous systems.\tThe
    number of unique Autonomous networks has grown to\t 47000 in mid-2014.\tInter-AS
    options and CSC are big data bottlenecks.\t The present Inter-AS options consider
    solutions such as\t inter-VRF, ASBR with MP-BGP,etc. As these consider the\t routes
    and prefixes, they do not really solve the scale\t problem. Thus we need to look
    for alternate ways to approach\t this problem.\tManipulating AS numbers, Cloud
    and network orchestrated Reflectors,\t HRR is required.\tSegment routing with
    parameters (eg: weight introduced into Segment\t routing) which can manipulate
    BGP AS path, communities are thus\t required.\tI use the word Cloud orchestrated
    Reflectors and Network\torchestrated Reflectors as the problem needs to be abstracted
    from\tthe Internet Architecture in order to avoid manageability issues in\tthe
    present and in the future.\tBased on the diagram involving the Cloud, Internet
    and Network\twhich is an implicit life cycle I believe that this is the only\toption
    to scale the Internet in the future. This is taking into\tconsideration the limitations
    right now in BGP convergence,\tInter-AS and Cloud computing.\tAs this is a limitation
    issue even if the manageability is not\tfeasible as of now it would still have
    to be considered in the\tfuture.\tThe implicit life cycle proves that the Internet
    needs to be\tchanged at the core as well and not just at the edges.\tCloud orchestrated
    reflectors are also important as the Internet\tcontinues to scale with the Cloud
    and SDN. Big data as defined\tin Hadoop through MapReduce suggests that the interface
    between\tCloud and Network is also important.\tNew BGP AF/SAF options do not really
    solve this scalability\tproblem:\tIP6\tIP-VPN\tBGP Flow Specification\tPseudo
    Wires\tL2VPN\t2547 Multicast VPNs\tThe scalability problem needs to be solved
    taking into\tconsideration the fact that the network cannot be declassified\tfrom
    the Cloud. Hence The IP Packet need to be classified through\ta new AF/SAF which
    could likely involve BGP, ASN, segment routing\tand path diversity, etc.\tAlternate
    ways to approach inter-AS is needed as the traditional\t methods are traffic (big
    data) bottlenecks.\tThis draft proposes the following:\tCloud and Network Orchestrated
    Reflectors to route the\tMulti-service, multi-tenant data between Cloud and Network.\tLimitations
    of the Cloud and Network can only be resolved through:\t1. IP Packet\t2. Segment
    routing (weight parameter, load balancing, distributed\t computing, QoS, etc)\t3.
    New AS numbers (having Cloud and Network orchestrated reflectors\t in a reserved,
    private or a public AS)\t4. Cloud and Network orchestrated Reflectors\t5. New
    BGP AF/SAF having Segment routing\t6. New Inter-AS options considering Segment
    Routing, distributed\t intelligence, Path diversity, LPM (longest prefix match)\tBenefits:\t1.
    Inter-AS options are based on inter-VRF, MPLS VPN and ASBRs\twhich re-distribute
    routes. Re-distributing repeats the routes.\t Segment routing with RR is a better
    option. MPLS takes the Big\t data away from Internet layer and towards Link layer.\t2.
    Segment routing needs to focus on Big Data, routing for Path\t diversity, LPM
    (Longest prefix match), QoS and Multi-service\t Mutli-tenant offerings.\t3. The
    benefits with Segment routing are that it can avoid\t redistribution and rely
    on path diversity, distributed\t intelligence, distributed computing, etc through
    the\t interworking of Cloud and Network.\t4. Benefits for Multi-service Multi-tenancy
    is greater scale,\t redundancy, distributed computing, distributed intelligence,\t
    Improved exchange and transit points for Services. These\t benefits outweigh the
    present Inter-AS options which are\t a big data bottleneck. Context Maps in BGP,
    Segment Routing\t and SDN Controllers. The traditional route maps in BGP can\t
    match for routes, BGP PA, communities. However for distributed\t intelligence
    and SDN Controllers the Service providers need\t to be more context-aware.\t Segment
    routing can act as a Centralized Controller in the SDN\t framework. However BGP,
    Segment routing does not support or cannot\t differentiate between different contexts
    (virtual, cloud, network)\t or services such as Network services , Web services
    (WSDL), Cloud\t services(REST API). A context map can map and act as an interface\t
    between the Cloud services, Network services and Web services.\tThe concept of
    Path diversity is analogous to the concept of\tTransmit diversity and Receiver
    diversity in Wireless networks.\tThe concept of Cloud reflectors is thus analogous
    to the concept\tof reflection in Wireless networks. Therefore it should be\ttheoretically
    possible to implement features like MIMO\t(Multi-input Multi-output) and Tx, Rx
    diversity in Wired networks\tthrough COR and context mapping. MIMO concepts such
    as Spatial\tMultiplexing and Diversity Precoding can be implemented through\tCloud
    Orchestrated Reflectors. This would also indirectly resolve\tthe problem of sub-optimal
    routing that occurs through Route\treflectors. Context maps or Context Mapping
    Language (CML) are\tthe next evolutionary step in Cloud-fog-Computing:\tRoute
    map-&gt; Policy map -&gt; Context map\tRPL --&gt; CML\tThis mapping between Cloud
    and Network is rather like an M2M\tinterface therefore the Context Maps or CML
    needs to be in both\tBGP as well as in the SDN Controller or Cloud.\tODL learns
    the Customer network through the NOR and transfers the\ttopology to the COR transparently.
    COR is just a contextual\trepresentation of the NOR. There is a one-to-many mapping
    between\tNOR and COR. For one NOR or ODL we can have multiple COR.\tThis is the
    most efficient way of Cloud and Network inter-working.\tContext maps can give
    us E2E context awareness for Smart cities,\tSmart grid, etc.\tDiagram 4: Cloud

    COR\tSecurity\tFrom a Security perspective the AI based bottoms-up/Top-down\t
    approach can help develop an Internet Map or a Cloud Map from\t this Seamless
    Cloud which can be further developed to form an\t Intelligent Secure network which
    is a Security-aware, Zone-aware\t Seamless Cloud. The Seamless cloud can dynamically
    identify and\t mitigate security vulnerabilities. Personalized Secure clouds can\t
    become a reality. Security boundaries and perimeters for the Cloud\t can be more
    clearly identified.\t A Distributed Intelligence system is more suited for the
    hierarchical\t layered system that defines a Network. A centralized control plane\t
    for the entire network may have vulnerabilities and also greatly\t increases the
    complexity. A distributed system is more practical\t considering the Routing/Switching
    infrastructure and Network layers\t that we have. From an AI perspective my draft
    would be a bottoms-up\t approach rather than a top-down approach.\t The Network
    needs to grow (and scale) towards the Cloud and not\t just the other way round.</p>"
