abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The field of Accounting Management is concerned with the collection
    ofresource consumption data for the purposes of capacity and trendanalysis, cost
    allocation, auditing, and billing. This documentdescribes each of these problems,
    and discusses the issues involved indesign of modern accounting systems.Since
    accounting applications do not have uniform security andreliability requirements,
    it is not possible to devise a singleaccounting protocol and set of security services
    that will meet allneeds. Thus the goal of accounting management is to provide
    a set oftools that can be used to meet the requirements of each application.This
    document describes the currently available tools as well as thestate of the art
    in accounting protocol design. A companion document,draft-brownlee-accounting-attributes-0x.txt,
    reviews the state of theart in accounting attributes and record formats.</p>"
