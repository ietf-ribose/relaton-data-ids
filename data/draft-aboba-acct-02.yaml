abstract:
- content: "<p>The field of Accounting Management is concerned with the collection
    of resource consumption data for the purposes of capacity and trend analysis,
    cost allocation, auditing, and billing. This document describes each of these
    problems, and discusses the issues involved in design of modern accounting systems.
    Since accounting applications do not have uniform security and reliability requirements,
    it is not possible to devise a single accounting protocol and set of security
    services that will meet all needs. Thus the goal of accounting management is to
    provide a set of tools that can be used to meet the requirements of each application.
    This document describes the currently available tools as well as the state of
    the art in accounting protocol design. A companion document, draft-brownlee-accounting-attributes-0x.txt,
    reviews the state of the art in accounting attributes and record formats.</p>"
