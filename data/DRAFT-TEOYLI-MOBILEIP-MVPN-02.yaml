abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies enhancements to Mobile IP that allow IP
    mobility\n   support across routing realms. The protocol allows a mobile node
    to\n   have the same home network connectivity, regardless of its current\n   routing
    realm network point of attachment. It is designed to work in\n   the presence
    of address collisions and network address translations.\n   Private networks connected
    to the public Internet can extend IP\n   mobility support to cover the public
    Internet and other private\n   networks. Movement from a private home network
    to the public foreign\n   network, from a private home network to another private
    foreign\n   network or from the public home network to a private foreign network\n
    \  are possible under the MPN framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
