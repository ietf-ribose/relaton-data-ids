abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly
    common\n   and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security\n
    \  threats is increasing. This document defines a set of requirements\n   for
    security solutions for time synchronization protocols, focusing\n   on the IEEE
    1588 and NTP. This document also discusses the security\n   impacts of time synchronization
    protocol practices, the time\n   synchronization performance implications of external
    security\n   practices, the dependencies between other security services and time\n
    \  synchronization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
