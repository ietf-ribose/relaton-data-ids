abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Ogg encapsulation for the Opus interactive\n
    \  speech and audio codec.  This allows data encoded in the Opus format\n   to
    be stored in an Ogg logical bitstream.  This provides Opus with a\n   long-term
    storage format supporting all of the essential features,\n   including metadata,
    fast and accurate seeking, corruption detection,\n   recapture after errors, low
    overhead, and the ability to multiplex\n   Opus with other codecs (including video)
    with minimal buffering.  It\n   also provides a live streamable format, capable
    of delivery over a\n   reliable stream-oriented transport, without requiring all
    the data,\n   or even the total length of the data, up-front, in a form that is\n
    \  identical to the on-disk storage format.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
