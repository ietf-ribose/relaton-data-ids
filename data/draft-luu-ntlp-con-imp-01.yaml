abstract:
- content: "<p>The working group NSIS (Next Step In Signaling) is created to define
    a new signaling protocol. This signaling protocol will be generic and applicable
    to the most of present and future signaling applications. Some of these signaling
    applications are resource reservation, communication protocol for middlebox, VPN,
    etc. The intention of NSIS is to re-use, where appropriate, the protocol mechanisms
    of RSVP while at the same time simplifying it and applying a more general signaling
    model. NSIS signaling protocol is composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS Transport
    Layer Protocol) layer is responsible for transporting signaling messages. NSLP
    (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) is the upper layer that contains functionality
    such as message formats and sequences, specific to a particular signaling application.

    This document outlines the proposal of implementation for NTLP which can satisfy
    the requirements defined in the NSIS working group.</p>"
