abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Initial Window (IW) provides the starting point for TCP's\n
    \  feedback-based congestion control algorithm. Its value has increased\n   over
    time to increase performance and to reflect increased\n   capability of Internet
    devices. This document describes a mechanism\n   to adjust the IW over long timescales,
    to make future changes more\n   safely deployed and to potentially avoid reexamination
    of this value\n   in the future.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
