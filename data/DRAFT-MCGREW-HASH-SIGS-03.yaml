abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic\n
    \  hash functions, following the seminal work in this area of Lamport,\n   Diffie,
    Winternitz, and Merkle, as adapted by Leighton and Micali in\n   1995.  It specifies
    a one-time signature scheme and a general\n   signature scheme.  These systems
    provide asymmetric authentication\n   without using large integer mathematics
    and can achieve a high\n   security level.  They are suitable for compact implementations,
    are\n   relatively simple to implement, and naturally resist side-channel\n   attacks.
    \ Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures\n   would still be
    secure even if it proves feasible for an attacker to\n   build a quantum computer.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
