abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The history of secure messaging in XMPP is spotty.  The long-running\n
    \  de facto scheme, OTR, enjoys fairly wide implementation and use, but\n   OTR
    suffers from some serious usability and security shortcomings\n   that make it
    unsuitable as a basis for encryption.\n\n   This document describes an architecture
    that provides end-to-end\n   confidentiality and integrity for XMPP messaging.
    \ Solutions for both\n   multi-user and one-to-one messaging are provided.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
