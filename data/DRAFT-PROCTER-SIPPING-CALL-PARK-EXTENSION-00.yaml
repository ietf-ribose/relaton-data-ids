abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that
    are\n   normally found on traditional PBXs.  Implementing these services\n   using
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in the way described in\n   the SIP Service
    Examples draft [1] is straightforward, but suffers\n   from a useability problem
    when implemented using SIP User Agents\n   resembling traditional business telephones.
    \ This draft discusses a\n   simple extension to cater for this style of endpoint.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
