abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community\n
    \  concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It\n   presents
    a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and\n   widespread deployment
    of active queue management (AQM) in network\n   devices, to improve the performance
    of today's Internet.  It also\n   urges a concerted effort of research, measurement,
    and ultimate\n   deployment of AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows
    that\n   are not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.\n\n   The
    note largely repeats the recommendations of RFC 2309, updated\n   after fifteen
    years of experience and new research.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
