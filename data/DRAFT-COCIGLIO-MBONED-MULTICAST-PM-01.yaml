abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a method to accomplish performance monitoring\nmeasurements
    on live IP flows, including packet loss, one-way delay\nand jitter.  The proposed
    method is applicable to both unicast and\nmulticast traffic, but only IP multicast
    streams are considered in\nthis document.  The method can be implemented using
    tools and\nfeatures already available on IP routers and does not require any\nprotocol
    extension.  For this reason, it does not raise any\ninteroperability issue.  However,
    the method could be further\nimproved by means of some extension to existing protocols,
    but this\naspect is left for further study and it is out of the scope of the\ndocument.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
