abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes the applicability of the Internet standardizationefforts
    on secure electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions forHealth Level-7 (HL7),
    an EDI standard for healthcare used worldwide.This memo heavily relies on the
    work in progress by the IETF EDIINTworking group. It is in most parts a restatement
    of the EDIINTsrequirements document and application statement 1 (AS#1) tailored
    to theneeds of the HL7 audience. We tried to make this document as selfconsistent
    as possible. The goal is to give to the reader who is not asecurity or Internet
    standards expert enough foundational and detailinformation to enable him to build
    communication software that compliesto the Internet standards. Even though we
    rely on and promote the respective Internet standardsand drafts, we did not withstand
    from commenting on and criticising thiswork where we see upcoming problems in
    use with HL7 or other EDIprotocols that have not been in the initial focus of
    the EDIINT workinggroup. We make suggestions to add parameters to the specification
    of theMIME type for EDI messages [RFC 1767] in order to enhance functionality.We
    give use cases for a larger subset of disposition types and modifiersof message
    disposition notifications. One key issue where this memo goes beyond the current
    EDIINT draftsis the concept of non-repudiation of commitment to an EDI transaction.Secure
    EDI transactions should be regarded as ``distributed contracts,''i.e. not only
    the sending and receiving of single messages should benon-refutable but also the
    connection between messages interchanges. Inanticipation of this requirement HL7
    usually requires a response messageto be sent to acknowledge every transaction.
    We therefore have therequirement to securely couple an EDI response message to
    its requestmessage. Given the current shape of RFC 1767 this is generally possibleonly
    if a response message is coupled with an MDN receipt and thecombi</p>"
