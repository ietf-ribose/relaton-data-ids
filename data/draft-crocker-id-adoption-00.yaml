abstract:
- content: "<p>The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as mandated
    by the working group's charter. Working groups develop these documents based on
    initial input of varying levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might
    be a document already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created
    by the workiing group, or it might represent any level of maturity in between.
    This document discusses the process of creating formal working group drafts that
    are targeted for publication.</p>"
