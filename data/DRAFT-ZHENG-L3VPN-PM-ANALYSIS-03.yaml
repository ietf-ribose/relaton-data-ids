abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other
    metrics on\n   a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific\n
    \  ingress VRF a packet belongs to.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point\n   network
    model applies, flow identifying is a challenge.  This\n   document summarizes
    the current performance monitoring mechanisms for\n   L3VPN in MPLS networks,
    and analyzes various solutions and challenges\n   for measuring performance metrics
    within these networks.  This\n   document also identifies various key points which
    needs to be taken\n   in consideration when designing L3VPN performance monitoring\n
    \  mechanisms.  Performance measurements within non-MPLS L3VPN networks\n   is
    not within the scope of the document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
