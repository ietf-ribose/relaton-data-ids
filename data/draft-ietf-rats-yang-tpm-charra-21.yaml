abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG RPCs and a few configuration nodes required
    to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from a device, following
    the operational context defined in TPM-based Network Device Remote Integrity Verification.
    Complementary measurement logs are also provided by the YANG RPCs, originating
    from one or more roots of trust for measurement (RTMs). The module defined requires
    at least one TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0 as well as a corresponding TPM Software Stack
    (TSS), or equivalent hardware implementations that include the protected capabilities
    as provided by TPMs as well as a corresponding software stack, included in the
    device components of the composite device the YANG server is running on.</p>"
