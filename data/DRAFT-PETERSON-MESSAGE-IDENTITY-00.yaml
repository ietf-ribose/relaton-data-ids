abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of the concept of identity
    in\n   Internet messaging systems as a means of preventing impersonation.\n   It
    describes the architectural roles necessary to provide identity,\n   and details
    some approaches to the generation of identity assertions\n   and the transmission
    of such assertions within messages.  The\n   trade-offs of various design decisions
    are explained.\n\t </p>\n      "
