  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a procedure for configuring hosts' IPv6\naddress
    which the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server through\nDHCPv6 protocol while
    the interface identifiers are independently\ngenerated by the hosts.  The method
    is applicable to\nCryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA), and other host-generated\nIPv6
    addresses.\n\t </p>\n      "
