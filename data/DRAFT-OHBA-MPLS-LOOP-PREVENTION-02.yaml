abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This paper presents a  simple mechanism,  based on 'threads',
    \ which\n    can  be  used to prevent MPLS  from  setting up  label switched path\n
    \   (LSPs) which have loops.  The mechanism is compatible with, but does\n    not
    require,  VC merge.  The mechanism  can be  used with either the\n    ordered
    \ downstream-on-demand    allocation  or  ordered  downstream\n    allocation.
    \  The amount of  information  that must  be passed in  a\n    protocol message
    is tightly bounded  (i.e., no path-vector is used).\n    When a node needs to
    change its next hop, a distributed procedure is\n    executed,  but  only nodes
    which   are downstream of  the change are\n    involved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
