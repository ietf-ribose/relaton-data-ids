abstract:
  content: "<p>A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
    services to its client. Given the client signal is configured, the followup function
    for performance monitoring, such as latency and bit error rate, would be needed
    for network operation. This document describes the data model to support the performance
    monitoring functionalities.</p>"
