abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants\n
    \  each sending their own media streams in an RTP session.\n   Unfortunately many
    implementations are designed only for point to\n   point voice over IP with a
    single source in each end-point.  Even\n   client implementations aimed at video
    conferences have often been\n   built with the assumption around central mixers
    that only deliver a\n   single media stream per media type.  Thus any application
    that wants\n   to allow for more advance usage where multiple media streams are
    sent\n   and received by an end-point has an issue with legacy\n   implementations.
    \ This document describes the problem and proposes a\n   solution for how to use
    multiple SSRCs within one RTP session and at\n   the same time handle the legacy
    issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
