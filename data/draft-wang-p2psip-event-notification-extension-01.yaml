abstract:
- content: "<p>The p2p technology is data centric. Data objects are distributed in
    the p2p overlay according to routing algorithm.Applications access the data objects
    via peer/client protocol or gateways, some of which need data replicas to be synchronized
    in real time. This can be achieved by introducing a Subscribe/Notify mechanism
    to p2psip. This document describes the Subscribe/Notify mechanism extension for
    p2psip, and also defines several new methods as needed.</p>"
