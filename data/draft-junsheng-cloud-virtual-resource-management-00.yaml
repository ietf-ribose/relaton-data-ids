abstract:
- content: "<p>In current Cloud and Data Center (DC) environment, the manageable virtualized
    resources aggregated by the Resource Management Platform (RMP) may be supplied
    by different types of hypervisor implementations. The RMP needs to support a variety
    of hypervisor APIs to allow access, management and integration of different types
    of resources. In order to decouple the RMP from any particular hypervisor implementation,
    a unified API needs to be developed. This draft presents the requirements and
    preliminary implementation considerations for such an API.</p>"
