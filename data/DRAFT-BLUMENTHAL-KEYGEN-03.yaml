abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes Pseudo Random Function (PRF) based on
    \nMAC function (keyed iterated hash function), and offers a ref-\nerence implementation
    of PRF based on SHA-1. \nThis PRF can be used to produce cryptographic keys for
    authen-\ntication/integrity and encryption. It uses pre-shared secret \nand publicly
    known random value (and possibly partiesâ€™ identi-\nties). The main advantage of
    this algorithm over other similar \nones is that its security is formally tied
    to the MAC property \nof the underlying function.\n\t </p>\n      "
