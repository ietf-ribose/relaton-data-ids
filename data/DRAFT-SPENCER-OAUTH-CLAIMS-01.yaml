abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to include a
    simple\n   query language that can be used by clients to request certain claims\n
    \  from an authorization server.  This mechanism can be used during the\n   authorization
    request and refresh request.  It also defines a\n   response parameter of the
    token and introspection endpoints that\n   indicates to the caller which claims
    were authorized by the resource\n   owner.  Lastly, it stipulates how this request
    parameter can be used\n   during token exchange, and how clients may request that
    certain\n   claims be placed in an access token intended for a particular\n   resource
    server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
