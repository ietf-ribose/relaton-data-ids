abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture for the forwarding
    of multicast data packets. In some scenarios, the resilience should be provided
    to guarantee the multicast data is protected by a given backup resource and forwarded
    successfully to the receivers in BIER-specific network. This document discusses
    the resilience use cases, requirements and proposes solutions for BIER, including
    the protection and restoration mechanisms and detection methods.</p>"
