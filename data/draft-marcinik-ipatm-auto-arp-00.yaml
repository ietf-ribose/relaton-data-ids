abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to RFC 1577 [1] that allows an ATMARP
    client to automatically locate its ATMARP server. This procedure is facilitated
    through the use of ATM anycast addressing [2]. ATMARP clients use a LIS-specific
    anycast address to locate their LIS-designated ATMARP Server. Both an ATMARP client
    and an ATMARP server algorithmically determine their LIS-specific anycast address
    upon restart. The use of this procedure will significantly relieve the administrative
    burden currently required to (re)configure a Classical IP network.</p>"
