abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a method by which a device or application
    may\n   signal information relating to current threat handling to other\n   devices/applications
    that may reside locally or at the service\n   provider.  The initial focus is
    ddos mitigation; however, the method\n   may be extended to communicate any threat
    type.  This will allow for\n   a vendor or provider agnostic approach to threat
    mitigation utilising\n   multiple layers of protection as the operator sees fit.\n\n
    \  The dissemination of threat information will occur utilising JSON RPC\n   API
    over HTTPS communications between devices/applications and will\n   be augmented
    by IPFIX and UDP or SCTP for signaling telemetry\n   information relating to attacks
    and protected object data.\n\n   An open standards based approach to communication
    between on-premise\n   DDoS mitigation devices and service provider based DDoS
    protection\n   services allows for enterprises to have a wider range of options
    to\n   better secure their environments without the limitations of vendor\n   lock-in.\n\n\n\t
