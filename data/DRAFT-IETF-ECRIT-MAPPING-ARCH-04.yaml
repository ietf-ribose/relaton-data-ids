abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an architecture for a global, scalable,
    resilient, and administratively distributed system for mapping geographic location
    information to URLs, using the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol.
    \ The architecture generalizes well-known approaches found in hierarchical lookup
    systems such as DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t
