abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution to Internet address depletion\n
    \  problem using a clever IPv4 option mechanism as a solution, called\n   enhanced
    IP (EnIP).  Because it is IPv4, it maximizes backward\n   compatibility while
    providing a six order of magnitude increase in\n   address space.  Unlike other
    similar proposals, care was taken to\n   avoid costly changes and requirements
    to the core network and border\n   routers, with the exception that options be
    passed in that equipment\n   as described below.  Because it is backward compatible,
    current IPv4\n   software, network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection/\n
    \  protection, and layer 5 firewalls can be maintained until IPv6 system\n   information
    security reaches acceptable maturity and availability.\n   In addition, because
    it is IPv4, the legally and operational\n   complexities can be postponed or avoided.\n\n\t
