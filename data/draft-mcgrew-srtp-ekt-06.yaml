abstract:
  content: "<p>SRTP Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to SRTP thatprovides
    for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, RolloverCounters, and other information,
    within SRTP or SRTCP. This facilityenables SRTP to work for decentralized conferences
    with minimalcontrol, and to handle situations caused by early media.This note
    defines EKT, and also describes how to use it with SDPSecurity Descriptions, DTLS-SRTP
    Key Transport (KTR), and MIKEY.These other key management protocols provide an
    EKT key to everyonein a session, and EKT coordinates the keys within the session.</p>"
