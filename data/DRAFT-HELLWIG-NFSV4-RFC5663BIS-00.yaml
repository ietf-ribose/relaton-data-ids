abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File Sharing version 4
    (NFSv4) to\n   allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used
    by the\n   NFSv4 server.  This ability to bypass the server for data access can\n
    \  increase both performance and parallelism, but requires additional\n   client
    functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on\n   the class of
    storage used.  The main pNFS operations document\n   specifies storage-class-independent
    extensions to NFS; this document\n   specifies the additional extensions (primarily
    data structures) for\n   use of pNFS with block- and volume-based storage.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
