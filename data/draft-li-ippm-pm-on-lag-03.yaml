abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement Protocol
    (OWAMP), Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), and Simple Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member
    link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). With the measured metrics of each member
    links of a LAG, it enables operators to enforce performance metric based traffic
    steering policy among the member links.</p>"
