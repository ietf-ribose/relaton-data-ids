abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism
    where\n   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to\n   indicate
    congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will\n   feed this information
    back to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP\n   in such a way that it can only
    feed back one congestion signal per\n   Round-Trip Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN
    for other transport\n   protocols, such as RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with
    more accurate\n   ECN feedback.  Recent new TCP mechanisms (like ConEx or DCTCP)
    need\n   more accurate ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is\n
    \  received in one RTT.  This document specifies requirements for an\n   update
    to the TCP protocol to provide more accurate ECN feedback.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
