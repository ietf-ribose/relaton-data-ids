abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an energy management
    framework for networked devices. This document presents the applicability of the
    EMAN information model in a variety of scenarios with cases and target devices.
    These use cases are useful for identifying requirements for the framework and
    MIBs. Further, we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to other relevant
    energy monitoring standards and architectures.</p>"
