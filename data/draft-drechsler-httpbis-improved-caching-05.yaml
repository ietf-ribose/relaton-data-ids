abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an improved HTTP caching method which can be
    applied in addition to the standard caching behavior for HTTP. It defines the
    associated header field that controls this improved caching mechanism and a modified
    caching operation which is slightly different to standard caching operation for
    HTTP.</p>"
