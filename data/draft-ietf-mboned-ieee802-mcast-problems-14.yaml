abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast
    in 802.11 (wifi) and other local-area wireless environments. This document describes
    the known limitations of wireless (primarily 802.11) Layer-2 multicast. Also described
    are certain multicast enhancement features that have been specified by the IETF,
    and by IEEE 802, for wireless media, as well as some operational choices that
    can be taken to improve the performance of the network. Finally, some recommendations
    are provided about the usage and combination of these features and operational
    choices.</p>"
