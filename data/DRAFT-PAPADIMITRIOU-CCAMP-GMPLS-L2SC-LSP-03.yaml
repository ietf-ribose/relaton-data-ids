abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused
    on \n   environments covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.). \n
    \  There is minimal documentation on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label \n   Switched
    Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous \n   Transfer Mode (ATM)
    LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. \n    \n   This document details GMPLS capabilities
    for supporting L2 LSPs in \n   several network environments including overlays.
    As such, it \n   provides a reference detailing the applicability of GMPLS for
    Layer-\n   2 switching environments in support of various deployment scenarios,\n
    \  including the integrated (e.g. multi LSP-region networks), the \n   augmented/peer
    and the overlay model (e.g. Generalized VPN (GVPN) \n   and user-network interfaces
    (GMPLS UNI)).\n\t </p>\n      "
