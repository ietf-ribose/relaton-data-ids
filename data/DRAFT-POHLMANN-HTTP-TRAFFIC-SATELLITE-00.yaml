abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has not\nreceived
    enough attention.  Satellites have an inherent\nbroadcasting ability useful for
    transmitting Internet\ntraffic.  They can send information to many locations\nsimultaneously
    depending on the coverage beam of the\nsatellite.  The issue of Internet use over
    satellites needs\nto be addressed so that future implementations of networking\nprotocols
    can be used with this medium.  The vast majority\nof Internet traffic is TCP traffic
    resulting from the HTTP\nprotocol so this issue will be addressed here.  It is
    hoped\nthat this facilitates the transition from the use of\nterrestial networks,
    to networks incorporating satellite\nlinks.\n\t </p>\n      "
