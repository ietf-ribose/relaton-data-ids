abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation by recursive DNS\n
    \  resolvers has been deployed at scale.  However, domain signing tools\n   and
    processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for\n   non-DNSSEC-related
    domain administration tools and processes.  This\n   sometimes results in DNSSEC
    validation failures, for which operators\n   of validating resolvers are often
    blamed.  When these failures do\n   occur, end users should not change to a non-validating
    DNS resolver,\n   as that would downgrade their security.  They should instead
    wait\n   until the authoritative domain operator updates their DNS records to\n
    \  resolve the error and that change propagates across the Internet's\n   DNS
    resolvers, the timing of which may be dependent upon the Time To\n   Live (TTL)
    settings in the old and/or erroneous DNS resource records.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
