abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the Communication
    Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem
    (IMS) supplementary service. As part of CDIV, a SIP based event package is used
    for notifying users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of requests
    for communication sessions targetting the user. This document defines the SIP
    event package to support subscription and notification of diversions. The proposed
    event package is applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not
    be applicable to the general internet.</p>"
