abstract:
- content: <p>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture describes
    how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through an IPv6 or MPLS
    network using the source routing paradigm. SR enables any head-end node to select
    any path without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE).
    It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link- State IGPs. A Segment
    Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest
    Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).
    Since SR can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane, a PCE should be
    able to compute SR-Path for both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane. This document
    describes the extensions required for SR support for IPv6 data plane in Path Computation
    Element communication Protocol (PCEP). The PCEP extension and mechanism to support
    SR-MPLS is described in RFC 8664. This document extends it to support SRv6 (SR
    over IPv6).</p>
