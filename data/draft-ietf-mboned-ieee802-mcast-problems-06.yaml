abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast
    in 802.11 and other local-area wireless environments. This document offers guidance
    on known limitations and problems with wireless multicast. Also described are
    certain multicast enhancement features that have been specified by the IETF and
    by IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as some operational choices that can be
    taken to improve the performace of the network. Finally, some recommendations
    are provided about the usage and combination of these features and operational
    choices.</p>"
