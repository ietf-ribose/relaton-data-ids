abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the
    GSMA (GSM Association)and a sub-namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station
    Equipment Identity), and associated parameter for the IMEISV (International Mobile
    station Equipment Identity and Software Version number). The IMEI is 15 decimal
    digits long and the IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and both are encoded using
    Binary Encoded Decimal (BCD). The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the
    specification for Global System for Mobile communications(GSM) and are also now
    incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP
    specification for GSM, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and
    3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution). The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify
    Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.</p>"
