abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Layer 2 transport services like MPLS offer only 2 states to encode\nECN
    state, if DiffServ based Class of Service is operated.  Still, a\nmechanism by
    which PCN egress nodes can differentiate between the\nnormal behaviour state,
    admission stop state control state and flow\ntermination state, by using PCN marking
    of packets is desirable.\nThis document describes how threshold and excess marking
    can be\ncombined with PCN baseline encoding.  A minimalistic approach like\nthe
    one described in the following has some obvious shortcomings.\nThese shortcomings
    are also presented and discussed.  Currently, the\naim of this document is to
    trigger experimentation feasability\nstudies.  Standardisation will be pursued
    in the future based on the\nresults of the studies.\n\t </p>\n      "
