abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The current IP Multicast model appears to achieve a level ofsimplicity
    by extending the IP unicast addressing model (historicallythe classful A,B, and
    C net numbers) from the mask and longest matchschemes of CIDR, with a new classful
    address space, class D. Therouting systems have been also built in a deceptively
    simple way inone of three manners - either broadcast and prune (DVMRP, Dense ModePIM),
    destination list based tree computation (MOSPF) or singlecentered trees (current
    sparse mode PIM and CBT). The multicastservice creates the illusion of a spectrum
    that one can 'tune in to',as an application writer. Due to this view, many have
    seen themulticast pilot service, the Mbone, as a worldwide Ethernet, wheresimple
    distributed algorithms can be used to allocate 'wavelengths'and advertise them
    through 'broadcast' on a channel (the sessiondirectory), associated with a spectrum.</p>"
