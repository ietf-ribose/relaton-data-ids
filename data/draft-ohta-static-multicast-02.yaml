abstract:
- content: "<p>The current IP Multicast model appears to achieve a level of simplicity
    by extending the IP unicast addressing model (historically the classful A,B, and
    C net numbers) from the mask and longest match schemes of CIDR, with a new classful
    address space, class D. The routing systems have been also built in a deceptively
    simple way in one of three manners - either broadcast and prune (DVMRP, Dense
    Mode PIM), destination list based tree computation (MOSPF) or single centered
    trees (current sparse mode PIM and CBT). The multicast service creates the illusion
    of a spectrum that one can 'tune in to', as an application writer. Due to this
    view, many have seen the multicast pilot service, the Mbone, as a worldwide Ethernet,
    where simple distributed algorithms can be used to allocate 'wavelengths' and
    advertise them through 'broadcast' on a channel (the session directory), associated
    with a spectrum.</p>"
