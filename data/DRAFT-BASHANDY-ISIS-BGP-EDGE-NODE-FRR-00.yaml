abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled between\nedge
    routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn know\nabout a prefix
    P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.  If\nthe edge router PEi crashes
    or becomes totally disconnected from the\ncore, it desirable for a core router
    \"P\" that is carrying traffic to\nthe failed edge router PEi to immediately restore
    traffic by re-\nrouting packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the
    prefix\nP/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj,\nuntil
    BGP re-converges. If the packets originally flowing to the\nfailed edge router
    PEi are labeled, then the repairing core router P\nrouter must swap the label
    advertised by the failed edge router PEi\nfor the prefix P/m with the label advertised
    for the same prefix by\nthe edge router PEj before re-routing the packet through
    an LSP\nterminating PEj. The document proposes an extension to IS-IS protocol\nto
    inform core routers about the repair edge router PEj and, for\nlabeled packets,
    the label that needs to be pushed/swapped before\nsending the packet into the
    tunnel terminating on PEj\n\n\t </p>\n      "
