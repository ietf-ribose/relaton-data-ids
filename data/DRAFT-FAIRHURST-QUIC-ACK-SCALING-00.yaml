abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On network paths where there is significant path asymmetry,\n
    \  acknowledgments of data receipt can reduce the efficient use of\n   network
    capacity.  This effect occurs when the return capacity is\n   significantly more
    constrained than the forward capacity, or the cost\n   of transmission per packet
    is a significant component of the total\n   transmission cost.  In these cases,
    reducing the ratio of\n   acknowledgements to data can improve link utilization
    and reduce link\n   transmission costs.\n\n   This document proposes a change
    to the default acknowledgement policy\n   of the QUIC transport protocol to improve
    performance over paths with\n   appreciable asymmetry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
