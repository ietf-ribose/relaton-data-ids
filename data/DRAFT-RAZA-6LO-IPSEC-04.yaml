abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the header compression mechanisms for
    IPsec\n   [RFC4301] based on the encoding scheme standardized in [RFC6282]. The\n
    \  IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated Security Payload\n   (ESP)
    headers are compressed using Next Header Compression (NHC)\n   defined in [RFC6282].
    This document does not invalidate any encoding\n   schemes proposed in 6LoWPAN
    [RFC6282] but rather complements it with\n   compressed IPsec AH and ESP headers
    using the free bits in the IPv6\n   Extension Header encoding. Also, this document
    does not require any\n   changes in a conventional IPsec host on the Internet;
    the header\n   compression is applied only at the 6LoWPAN layer and is effective\n
    \  within 6LoWPAN networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
