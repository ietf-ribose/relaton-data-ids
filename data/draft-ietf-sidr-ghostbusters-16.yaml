    completely obscure names or any other information that might be useful for contacting
    responsible parties to deal with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance,
    roll-overs, compromises, etc. This document describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record
    containing human contact information that may be verified (indirectly) by a Certification
    Authority (CA) certificate. The data in the record are those of a severely profiled
    vCard. [STANDARDS- TRACK]</p>"
