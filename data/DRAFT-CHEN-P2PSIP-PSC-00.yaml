abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P)
    \nsignaling protocol for use on the Internet. This document proposes a \nsecurity
    extension for RELOAD. A new data transmission security model\nwas introduced in
    this draft. This model was based on a central Key\nManagement Server (KMS). Security
    communications among multi peers \ncan be achieved with PSC(Public Security Channel).
    PSC can also get\nperformance improvement compared with TLS/DTLS method in \nRELAOD
    draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
