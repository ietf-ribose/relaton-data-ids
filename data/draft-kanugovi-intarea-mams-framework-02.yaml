abstract:
- content: "<p>In multiconnectivity scenarios the end-user devices can simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. Both the quality of experience of the users
    and the overall network utilization and efficiency may be improved through a smart
    selection and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically
    adapt to changing network conditions. The document presents a unified problem
    statement and introduces a solution for managing multiconnectivity. The solution
    has been developed based on the authors' experience in multiple standards bodies
    including the IETF and 3GPP and is not an Internet Standard. It describes the
    requirements, solution principles and the architectural framework that ensures
    best performance and can be easily implemented in a wide variety of multiconnectivity
    deployments. It specifies the the protocol multi-access management to 1) flexibly
    select the best combination of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink,
    as well as 2) determining the user plane treatment and traffic distribution over
    the selected links ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced application
    performance.</p>"
