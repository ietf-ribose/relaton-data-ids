abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The privacy requirement of anonymity is much harder to achieve
    than\n   security goals like confidentiality or authentication, since network\n
    \  routing has to take place between well known spots of the network.\n   There
    are solutions providing anonymity on the Internet implemented\n   on the application
    level, but there's also a possibility to achieve\n   local anonymity on Ethernet
    networks without the introduction of new\n   anonymous protocols by following
    a protocol anonymizing approach\n   described in this document.  Protocol anonymization
    is a simple\n   network operation mode, which can provide local client anonymity
    on\n   Ethernet networks under certain circumstances by eliminating the host\n
    \  identification capabilities of widely used local network protocols.\n\t </p>\n
