abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a network running PIM-SM, multicast traffic can fail to be\n
    \  properly routed and forwarded during some period of time after a\n   topology
    change, when unicast routing converges to a new path using a\n   new next-hop
    before multicast routing adjacencies are fully setup\n   with this new next-hop.
    \ At this point, a blackhole appears in the\n   multicast topology and persists
    until the PIM adjacency become fully\n   setup.  This document describes different
    procedures aiming at\n   avoiding such blackholes, focusing on the use of non-congruent\n
    \  unicast routing that takes into account the status of PIM\n   adjacencies.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
