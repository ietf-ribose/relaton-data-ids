abstract:
  content: "<p>This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture, whichmakes
    the combination of P2P and SIP practical. In thisarchitecture, heterogeneous overlays
    are inter-connected via adecentralized manner provided by the hierarchical P2P-SIParchitecture.
    The overhead of the session control process is reducedsince the P2P overlay is
    used by SIP as the underlying peer locatingapproach. Some nodes in the overlay
    are proposed to be stateful toimprove the reliability of the overlay. Finally,
    a session initialexample is presented to illustrate this architecture.This work
    isbeing discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing list.</p>"
