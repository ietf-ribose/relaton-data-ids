abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile
    backhaul\n   network, it is required that tunnels between two PEs could be setup\n
    \  automatically driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration\n   effort.
    Moreover the tunnels must be setup co-routed for the\n   goodness of performance
    monitoring and uniform protection behavior\n   for link failure on two directions.
    This is described in [I-D.li-\n   mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk]. This document
    introduces a new\n   BGP VT route based on [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]. The route
    is\n   utilized by on side PE to advertise Tunnel ID to other side PE,\n   so
    inverse direction co-routed LSPs can be setup based on path\n   information of
    member LSPs in the first tunnel.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
