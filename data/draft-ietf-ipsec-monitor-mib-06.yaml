abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPsecsecurity
    associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be usedfor configuring IPsec
    implementations or for providing low-leveldiagnostic or debugging information.
    It assumes no specific use ofIPsec. Further, it does not provide policy information.The
    purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators todetermine operating conditions
    and perform system operational levelmonitoring of the IPsec portion of their network.
    Statistics areprovided as well. Additionally, it may be used as the basis forapplication
    specific MIBs for specific uses of IPsec SAs.</p>"
