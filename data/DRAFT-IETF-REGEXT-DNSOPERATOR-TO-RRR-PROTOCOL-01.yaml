abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are several problems that arise in the standard\n   Registrant/Registrar/Registry
    model when the operator of a zone is\n   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar
    for the delegation.\n   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to
    difficulty\n   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records\n
    \  for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the\n   operator
    first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a\n   serious issue.\n\n
    \  When the domain on the other hand uses DNSSEC it necessary to make\n   regular
    (sometimes annual) changes to the delegation, in order to\n   track KSK rollover,
    by updating the delegation's DS record(s).  Under\n   the current model this is
    prone to delays and errors.  Even when the\n   Registrant has outsourced the operation
    of DNS to a third party the\n   registrant still has to be in the loop to update
    the DS record.\n\n   There is a need for a simple protocol that allows a third
    party DNS\n   operator to update DS and NS records in a trusted manner for a\n
    \  delegation without involving the registrant for each operation.  This\n   same
    protocol can be used by Registrants.\n\n   The protocol described in this draft
    is REST based, and when used\n   through an authenticated channel can be used
    to establish the DNSSEC\n   Initial Trust (to turn on DNSSEC or bootstrap DNSSEC).
    \ Once DNSSEC\n   trust is established this channel can be used to trigger maintenance\n
    \  of delegation records such as DS, NS, and glue records.  The protocol\n   is
    kept as simple as possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
