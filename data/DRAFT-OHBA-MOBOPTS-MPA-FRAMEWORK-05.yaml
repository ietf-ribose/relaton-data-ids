abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre-\n
    \  Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that\n   addresses
    the issues on existing mobility management protocols and\n   mobility optimization
    mechanisms to support inter-domain handover.\n   MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure
    handover optimization scheme that\n   works over any link-layer and with any mobility
    management protocol\n   and is best applicable to support optimization during
    inter-domain\n   handover.  MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive\n
    \  handover techniques allow many of the handoff related operations to\n   take
    place before the mobile has moved to the new network.  We\n   describe the details
    of all the associated techniques and its\n   applicability for different scenarios
    involving various mobility\n   protocols during inter-domain handover.\n\n\t </p>\n
