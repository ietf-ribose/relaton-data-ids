abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) provides an auxiliary
    logical data channel associated with a Label Switched Path (LSP), a pseudowire,
    or a section (link) over which a variety of protocols may flow.  These protocols
    are commonly used to provide Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
    mechanisms associated with the primary data channel.  This document specifies
    simple procedures by which an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform
    the other endpoints of its capabilities and configuration parameters, or other
    application-specific information.  This information may then be used by the receiver
    to validate or adjust its local configuration, and by the network operator for
    diagnostic purposes.\n\t </p>\n      "
