abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, to
    enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy multicast
    support, and enable a large degree of scalability by splitting the broadcast domains.
    A higher speed backbone federates multiple wireless links to form a large MultiLink
    Subnet. Backbone Routers acting as Layer-3 Access Point route packets to registered
    nodes, where an classical Layer-2 Access Point would bridge. Conversely, wireless
    nodes register to the Backbone Router to setup routing services in a fashion that
    is essentially similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</p>"
