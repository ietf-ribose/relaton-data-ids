abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends PASSporT, which is specified in RFC 8225 to convey
    cryptographically-signed information about the people involved in personal communications,
    to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its original destination
    to a new one. This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification
    services in call forwarding scenarios. Also specified here is an encapsulation
    mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying
    parties in some diversion scenarios.</p>"
