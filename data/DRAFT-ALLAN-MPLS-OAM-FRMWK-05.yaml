  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet draft discusses many of the issues associated with\nuser
    plane OAM for MPLS. The goal being to provide tools to perform\n'in service' maintenance
    of LSPs. Included in this discussion is\nsome of the implications of MPLS architecture
    on the ability to\nsupport fault, diagnostic and performance management OAM\napplications,
    potential solutions for distinguishing user plane OAM,\nand a summary of what
    the authors believe can be achieved in\naddressing all aspects of the MPLS architecture.\n\t
