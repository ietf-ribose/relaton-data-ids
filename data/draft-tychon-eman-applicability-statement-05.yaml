abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Energy Management (EMAN)is to provide an energy management
    framework for networked devices. This document presents the applicability of the
    EMAN framework for a variety of scenarios. This document lists use cases and target
    devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and associated SNMP
    MIB modules. These use cases are useful for identifying monitoring requirements
    that need to be considered. Further, we describe the relationship of the EMAN
    framework to relevant other energy monitoring standards and architectures.</p>"
