abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal, message-passing\n
    \  transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.\n   Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the\n   Internet, applications
    and upper-layer protocols that choose to use\n   UDP as an Internet transport
    must employ mechanisms to prevent\n   congestion collapse and establish some degree
    of fairness with\n   concurrent traffic.  This document provides guidelines on
    the use of\n   UDP for the designers of such applications and upper-layer protocols\n
    \  that cover congestion-control and other topics, including message\n   sizes
    and reliability.\n\t </p>\n      "
