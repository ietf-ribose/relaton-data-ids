abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330
    with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing. The memo updates
    the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC 2330 to include IPv6 packets.
    It also augments distinguishing aspects of packets, referred to as Type-P for
    test packets in RFC 2330. Two points (at least) are worthwhile discussing further:
    extent of coverage for 6LO and IPv6 Header Compression, and the continued need
    to define a "minimal standard-formed packet".</p>'
