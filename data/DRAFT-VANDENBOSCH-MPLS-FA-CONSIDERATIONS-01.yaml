abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Forwarding adjacencies (FA) as described in [2] are a useful tool
    \nfor improving the scalability of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic \nEngineering
    (TE). Through the aggregation of TE LSPs this concept \nenables the creation of
    a TE-LSP Hierarchy. Forwarding adjacency \nLSPs (FA-LSP or simply FA) may be advertised
    as TE link into the \nsame instance of ISIS/OSPF as the one that was used to create
    the \nLSP, allowing other LSRs to use FAs as TE-links for their path \ncomputation.
    As such, forwarding adjacency LSP have characteristics \nof both links and LSPs.\nThis
    document list a number of topics for further study regarding \nforwarding adjacencies
    in an attempt to identify what future work \nmay result in the MPLS WG (or other)
    from the link/LSP duality.\n\t </p>\n      "
