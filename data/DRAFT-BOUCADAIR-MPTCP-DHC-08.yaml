abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the
    server\n   side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n
    \  that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called MPTCP\n   Conversion
    Point (MCP).  Network-assisted MPTCP deployment models are\n   designed to facilitate
    the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of\n   multi-path communications without
    making any assumption about the\n   support of MPTCP by the communicating peers.
    \ MCPs located in the\n   network are responsible for establishing multi-path
    communications on\n   behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities\n
    \  to achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    focuses on the explicit deployment scheme where the\n   identity of the MPTCP
    Conversion Point(s) is explicitly configured on\n   connected hosts.  This document
    specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6)\n   options to configure hosts with Multipath TCP
    (MPTCP) parameters.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
