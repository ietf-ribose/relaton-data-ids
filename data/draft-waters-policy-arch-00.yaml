abstract:
- content: "<p>This document articulates the requirements and basic components of
    a policy-based management architecture. It focuses on the storage and retrieval
    of policy rules from a directory-based repository, for use in the management of
    network devices. The architecture is described in terms of its functional components
    and operational characteristics. It is intended to be device and vendor independent,
    interoperable and scalable. There are three basic sections of this draft, addressing:
    o the motivation for policy-based management that briefly describes the requirements
    for a policy framework architecture; o a reference model that defines a first-level
    functional decomposition and captures the key concepts in defining policy tools,
    policy rules, the use of a repository and schema, and the mechanisms underlying
    the definition, storage and retrieval of policies; and o an architecture that
    describes each of the functional components, and includes a narrative about how
    the architecture will execute.</p>"
