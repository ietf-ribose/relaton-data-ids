abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking ResearchGroup
    and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to itspublication as an RFC
    were raised.This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol usingHistory
    of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a variant of theepidemic routing protocol
    for intermittently connected networks thatoperates by pruning the epidemic distribution
    tree to minimizeresource usage while still attempting to achieve the best caserouting
    capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended for use insparse mesh networks
    where there is no guarantee that a fullyconnected path between source and destination
    exists at any time,rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messagesbetween
    hosts. These networks are examples of networks where thereis a disparity between
    the latency requirements of applications andthe capabilities of the underlying
    network (networks often referredto as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant). The document
    presents anarchitectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</p>"
