abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and a mapping function for 5G mobile
    user plane with transport network slicing, integrated with Mobile Radio Access
    and a Virtualized Core Network. The integrated approach is specified in a way
    to fit into the 5G core network architecture defined in [TS23.501]. It focuses
    on an optimized mobile user plane functionality with various transport services
    needed for some of the 5G traffic needing low and deterministic latency, real-time,
    mission-critical services. This document describes, how this objective is achieved
    agnostic to the transport underlay used (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS) in various deployments
    and with a new transport network underlay routing, called Preferred Path Routing
    (PPR).</p>"
