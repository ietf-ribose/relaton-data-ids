abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a mechanism to encapsulate layer
    4\n   transport protocols over UDP. Such encapsulation facilitates\n   deployment
    of alternate transport protocols or transport protocol\n   features on the Internet.
    DTLS can be employed to encrypt the\n   encapsulated transport header in a packet
    thus minimizing the\n   exposure of transport layer information to the network
    and so\n   promoting the end-to-end networking principle. Transport connection\n
    \  identification can be disassociated from network location (IP\n   addresses)
    to provide connection persistence for mobility and across\n   state eviction in
    NAT.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
