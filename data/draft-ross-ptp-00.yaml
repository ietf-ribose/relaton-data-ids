abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to propose a protocol called Telephony
    Tunneling Protocol (TTP) to tunnel one or more plain old telephone system (POTS)
    connections between two Internet hosts. The hosts may have one or more telephones
    connected directly to them or may receive calls from the local Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN). The Internet hosts are connected via two or more TCP
    connections (one for control and each of the others for one channel of voice traffic).
    This document makes no specification for sending Signaling System 7 (SS7) or other
    PSTN control commands through the control connection, though such commands may
    be outlined in other documents. Comments are solicited and should be sent to the
    author, Michael Ross &lt;rossmi@attbi.com&gt;</p>"
