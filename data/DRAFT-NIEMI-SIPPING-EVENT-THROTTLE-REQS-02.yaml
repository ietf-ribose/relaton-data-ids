abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>All event packages are required to specify a maximum rate at which\nevent
    notifications are generated by a single notifier.  Such a limit\nis provided in
    order to reduce network congestion.  In addition to\nthe fixed limits introduced
    by specific event packages, further\nmechanisms for limiting the rate of event
    notification are also\nallowed to be defined by event package specifications but
    none have\nbeen specified so far.  This memo discusses the requirements for a\nthrottle
    mechanism that allows a subscriber to further limit the rate\nof event notification.\n\t
