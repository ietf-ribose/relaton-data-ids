abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC performance protocol provides a simple, general-purpose\n
    \  protocol for testing the performance characteristics of a QUIC\n   implementation.
    \ With this protocol a generic server can support any\n   number of client-driven
    performance tests and configurations.\n   Standardizing the performance protocol
    allows for easy comparisons\n   across different QUIC implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n
