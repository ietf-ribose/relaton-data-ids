abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service models
    (e.g., the L3VPM Service Model) to Traffic Engineering (TE) models (e.g., the
    TE Tunnel or the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks Virtual
    Network model). This model is referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and is applicable
    to the operator's need for seamless control and management of their VPN services
    with TE tunnel support. The model is principally used to allow monitoring and
    diagnostics of the management systems to show how the service requests are mapped
    onto underlying network resource and TE models.</p>"
