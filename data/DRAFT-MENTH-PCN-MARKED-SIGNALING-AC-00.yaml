abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality\nof
    service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\noverall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC5559.  This memo is one\nof a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN\ndomain.\n\nThis document proposes
    an admission control method.  It assumes that\nPCN nodes perform threshold-marking
    configured with the PCN-\nadmissible-rate on any link.  The PCN marking state
    of an initial\nsignaling message of a flow is used to determine whether the flow\nshould
    be admitted or blocked.\n\t </p>\n      "
