abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure
    transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for HTTP/2 semantics.
    While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application protocol, QUIC builds on decades
    of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive
    as a modern general-purpose transport. QUIC provides multiplexing and flow control
    equivalent to HTTP/2, security equivalent to TLS, and connection semantics, reliability,
    and congestion control equivalent to TCP.</p>"
