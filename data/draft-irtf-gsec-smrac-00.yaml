  content: "\t <t>This document seeks to provide a solution to secure the multicastedge,
    in particular the 'last-hop' of the multicast between multicastedge routers and

    solution to prevent an illegalhost from pulling the multicast distribution tree
    into the host'snetwork when no other legal hosts exists in that same network.</p>"
