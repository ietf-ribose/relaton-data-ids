abstract:
- content: "<p>This document seeks to provide a solution to secure the multicast edge,
    in particular the 'last-hop' of the multicast between multicast edge routers and
    hosts within a network. In this document, we proposed a simple and light-weight
    solution to prevent an illegal host from pulling the multicast distribution tree
    into the host's network when no other legal hosts exists in that same network.</p>"
