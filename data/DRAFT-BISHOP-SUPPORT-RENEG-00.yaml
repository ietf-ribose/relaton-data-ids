abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The HTTP/2 spec requires that TLS renegotiation not be employed
    when\n   the negotiated application protocol is HTTP/2.  This document defines\n
    \  an extension to HTTP/2 which permits renegotiation to be employed by\n   peers
    which mutually consent to do so, while allowing peers to\n   understand whether
    renegotiation is permitted before attempting it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
