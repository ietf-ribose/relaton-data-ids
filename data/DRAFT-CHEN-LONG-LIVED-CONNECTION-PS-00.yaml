abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes issues encountered by a long-lived TCP\nconnection.
    \ Long-lived TCP connections are served for several\napplications, which are quite
    popularly used in our daily life, such\nas chat and messaging(MSN, Skype).  Others
    are computer-to-computer\ncommunications, which are also demanding at long-lived
    TCP\nconnection.  Issues such as network resources consumption happen when\nthere
    are frequent keepalive message has been transmitted\nperiodically.  Moreover,
    other issues are occurring during long TCP\nconnection, such as TCP congestion,
    TCP connection recovery.\nDepending on raised issues, protocol optimization could
    be considered\nto optimize network quality.\n\t </p>\n      "
