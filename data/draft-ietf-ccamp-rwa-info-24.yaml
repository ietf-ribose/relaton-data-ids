abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a model of information needed by the Routing
    and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
    (WSONs). The purpose of the information described in this model is to facilitate
    constrained optical path computation in WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility
    constraints between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not include
    constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this information that may be
    of use to other technologies utilizing a GMPLS control plane are discussed.</p>"
