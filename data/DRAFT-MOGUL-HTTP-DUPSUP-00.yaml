abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly\n
    \       duplicated under several different URIs.  This duplication\n        can
    lead to suboptimal use of network bandwidth, and\n        unnecessary latency
    for users.  Much of this duplication\n        can be avoided through the use of
    a simple mechanism,\n        described here, which allows a cache to efficiently\n
    \       substitute one byte-for-byte identical value for another.\n        By
    doing so, the cache avoids some or all of the network\n        costs associated
    with retrieving the duplicate value.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
