abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network survivability refers to the capability of the network
    to \nmaintain service continuity in the presence of faults within the \nnetwork
    [1]. This can be accomplished by recovering quickly from \nnetwork failures quickly
    and maintaining the required QoS for existing \nservices. With the increasing
    sophistication of network technologies, \nsurvivability capabilities are becoming
    available at multiple layers, \nallowing for protection and restoration to occur
    at any layer of the \nnetwork. This makes it important to: scrutinize the recovery
    features \nof different network layers, understand the pros and cons of performing
    \nrecovery at each layer, and assess how the interactions between layers \nimpact
    network survivability. With these objectives in mind, this draft \nexamines the
    considerations for network survivability at different \nlayers of the network.\n\t
