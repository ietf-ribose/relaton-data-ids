abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the advertisement of Non Shortest Path\n
    \  Forwarding IDentifier (NSPF ID) TLV and the computation procedures\n   for
    the same in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols.  NSPF ID allows to\n   simplify the data
    plane path description of data traffic in SR\n   deployments.  This helps to mitigate
    the MTU issues that are caused\n   by additional SR overhead of the packet and
    allows traffic\n   statistics.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
