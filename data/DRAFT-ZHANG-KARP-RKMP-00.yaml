abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two
    routers\n   need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion.\n
    \  In order to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography,\n   a
    secret key needs to be established.  This document defines a Router\n   Key Management
    Protocol (RKMP) for establishing and managing such\n   keys for routing protocols.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
