abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes three new sub-TLVs for egress routers to advertise
    the Edge Service Metadata of the directly attached edge services (ES). The Edge
    Service Metadata can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network
    to make path selection not only based on the routing cost but also the running
    environment of the edge services. The goal is to improve latency and performance
    for 5G edge services. The extension enables an edge service at one specific location
    to be more preferred than the others with the same IP address (ANYCAST) to receive
    data flows from a specific source, like specific User Equipment (UE).</p>"
