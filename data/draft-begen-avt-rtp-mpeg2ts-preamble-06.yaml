abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Demultiplexing and decoding an MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)requires
    the knowledge of specific information about the transportstream, which we refer
    to as the MPEG2-TS Preamble. While thisinformation is spread over different locations
    throughout thetransport stream and can be eventually assembled after some time
    areceiver started receiving the MPEG2-TS, the time it takes toretrieve all this
    information (especially in multicast environments)may be long. Instead, having
    this information readily available as aPreamble and sending the Preamble to a
    receiver that will shortlystart receiving the transport stream will virtually
    eliminate thewaiting time and let the receiver start processing/decoding theMPEG2-TS
    sooner. In this document, we give an overview of theMPEG2-TS and the delay components
    in video systems, and motivate theneed for constructing and using the MPEG2-TS
    Preamble for rapidlyacquiring the source stream in RTP multicast sessions. We
    alsodefine and register the RTP payload format for the MPEG2-TS Preamble.</p>"
