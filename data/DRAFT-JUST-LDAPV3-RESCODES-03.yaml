abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to describe, in some detail, the\nmeaning
    and use of the result codes used with the LDAPv3 protocol.\nOf particular importance
    are the error codes, which represent the\nmajority of the result codes.  This
    document provides definitions for\neach result code, and outlines the expected
    behaviour of the various\noperations with respect to how result codes and in particular,
    error\nconditions should be handled and which specific error code should be\nreturned.\n\nThe
    LDAPv3 RFC [RFC2251] states that  'An LDAP server MUST act in\naccordance with
    the X.500(1993) series of ITU recommendations when\nproviding the service. However,
    it is not required that an LDAP\nserver make use of any X.500 protocols in providing
    this service,\ne.g. LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so long
    as\nthe X.500 data and service model as used in LDAP is not violated in\nthe LDAP
    interface.' The goal of this document is to transfer the\napplicable information
    from X.511 to this document, and expand upon\nit for LDAP.\n\t </p>\n      "
