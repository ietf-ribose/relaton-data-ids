abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provide greater scalability, network confidentiality, and
    service independence, Segment Routing (SR) utilizes a Binding Segment Identifier
    (BSID). It is possible to associate a BSID to an RSVP-TE- signaled Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Path or an SR Traffic Engineering path. The BSID can be used by
    an upstream node for steering traffic into the appropriate TE path to enforce
    SR policies. This document specifies the concept of binding value, which can be
    either an MPLS label or Segment Identifier. It further specifies an extension
    to Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol(PCEP) for reporting the
    binding value by a Path Computation Client (PCC) to the PCE to support PCE-based
    Traffic Engineering policies.</p>"
