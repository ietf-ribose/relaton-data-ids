abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address blocks
    into the reverse DNS namespace. The reverse DNS naming method is commonly used
    to specify a complete IP address. This document describes how to encode an IPv4
    or IPv6 CIDR address block such as 129.82.128.0/17. By defining a common naming
    convention, one can associate information with a prefix. The convention builds
    on past work in RFC 1101 that associates network names with prefixes. However,
    this previous work pre-dated the introduction of CIDR and has several critical
    ambiguities. This convention corrects the ambiguities and enables new applications
    ranging from routing information to geolocation.</p>"
