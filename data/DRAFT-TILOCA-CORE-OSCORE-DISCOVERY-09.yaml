abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   can be secured by means of Group Object Security for Constrained\n
    \  RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may\n   not
    know the exact security groups to join, the respective Group\n   Manager, or other
    information required to perform the joining\n   process.  This document describes
    how a CoAP endpoint can use\n   descriptions and links of resources registered
    at the CoRE Resource\n   Directory to discover security groups and to acquire
    information for\n   joining them through the respective Group Manager.  A given
    security\n   group may protect multiple application groups, which are separately\n
    \  announced in the Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing a\n   pool
    of resources.  This approach is consistent with, but not limited\n   to, the joining
    of security groups based on the ACE framework for\n   Authentication and Authorization
    in constrained environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
