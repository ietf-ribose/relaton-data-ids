abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for
    theInternet termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on theemerging Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested touse `two primary addresses
    simultaneously' by duplicating the packettransmissions (while halving the transmission
    rate) during handoff toprovide `soft' handover. Moreover, we described the inter-working
    ofcSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to facilitate locationmanagement
    function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate theassociations and need to locate
    Mobile Nodes (MNs).</p>"
