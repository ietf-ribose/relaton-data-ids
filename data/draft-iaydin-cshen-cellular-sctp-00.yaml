abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for the
    Internet termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on the emerging Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested to use `two primary addresses
    simultaneously' by duplicating the packet transmissions (while halving the transmission
    rate) during handoff to provide `soft' handover. Moreover, we described the inter-working
    of cSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to facilitate location management
    function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate the associations and need to
    locate Mobile Nodes (MNs).</p>"
