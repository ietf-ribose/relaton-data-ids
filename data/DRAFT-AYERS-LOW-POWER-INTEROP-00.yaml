abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses guidelines for specifying low-power
    Internet\n   protocols in order to improve implementation interoperability. These\n
    \  guidelines are based around the importance of balancing memory usage\n   and
    energy efficiency, and the importance of not relying on Postel's\n   law when
    dealing with low resource devices. This document applies\n   these guidelines
    to the IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area\n   networks (6LoWPAN) Internet
    Standard, suggesting changes that would\n   make it more likely for implementations
    to interoperate.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
