abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths
    between peers for a TCP/IP session, and it could improve resource usage within
    the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved
    resilience to network failure. This document discusses the mechanism of a new
    network entity, named MPTCP proxy, which is aimed to assist MPTCP capable peer
    to use MPTCP session in case of one of the peers not being MPTCP capable or to
    act as an aggregation point for sublfows.</p>"
