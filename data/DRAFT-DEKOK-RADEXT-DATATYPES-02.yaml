abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades,
    without\n   rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time,\n
    \  RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them\n   to
    as managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document\n   updates the specifications
    to match established prctice.  We do this\n   by naming data types defined in
    [RFC6158], which have been used since\n   at least [RFC2865].  We provide an IANA
    registry for the data types,\n   and update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry
    to include a \"data\n   type\" field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend
    that authors\n   of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing\n
    \  practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
