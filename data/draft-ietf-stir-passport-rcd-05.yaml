abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal communications, to include rich data that can
    be transmitted and subsequently rendered to users, extending identifying information
    beyond human-readable display name comparable to the "Caller ID" function common
    on the telephone network. The element defined for this purpose, Rich Call Data
    (RCD), is an extensible object defined to either be used as part of STIR or with
    SIP Call-Info to include related information about calls that helps people decide
    whether to pick up the phone. This signing of the RCD information is also enhanced
    with an integrity mechanism to optionally protect the handling of this information
    between authoritative and non- authoritative parties authoring and signing the
    Rich Call Data for support of different usage and content policies.</p>
