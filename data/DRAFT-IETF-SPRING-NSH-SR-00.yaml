abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two application scenarios where Network\n
    \  Service Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) techniques can be\n   deployed
    together to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an\n   efficient manner
    while maintaining separation of the service and\n   transport planes as originally
    intended by the SFC architecture.\n\n   In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC
    is created using SR as the\n   transport between Service Function Forwarders (SFFs).
    \ SR in this\n   case is just one of many encapsulations that could be used to\n
    \  maintain the transport-independent nature of NSH-based service\n   chains.\n\n
    \  In the second scenario, SR is used to represent each service hop of\n   the
    NSH-based SFC as a segment within the segment-list.  SR and NSH\n   in this case
    are integrated.\n\n   In both scenarios SR is responsible for steering packets
    between SFFs\n   along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH is responsible\n
    \  for maintaining the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance\n   context,
    and any associated metadata.\n\n   These application scenarios demonstrate that
    NSH and SR can work\n   jointly and complement each other leaving the network
    operator with\n   the flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes
    sense in\n   specific areas of their network infrastructure, and still maintain
    an\n   end-to-end service plane using NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
