abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication
    (TESLA). TESLA allows all receivers to check the integrity and authenticate the
    source of each packet in multicast or broadcast data streams. TESLA requires no
    trust between receivers, uses low-cost operations per packet at both sender and
    receiver, can tolerate any level of loss without retransmissions, and requires
    no per-receiver state at the sender. TESLA can protect receivers against denial
    of service attacks in certain circumstances. Each receiver must be loosely time-synchronized
    with the source in order to verify messages, but otherwise receivers do not have
    to send any messages. TESLA alone cannot support non-repudiation of the data source
    to third parties. This informational document is intended to assist in writing
    standardizable and secure specifications for protocols based on TESLA in different
    contexts. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
