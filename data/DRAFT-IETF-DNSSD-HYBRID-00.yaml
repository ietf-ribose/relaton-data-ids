abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local\n
    \  Multicast DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local\n   link,
    but not (without some kind of proxy or similar special support)\n   of services
    that are outside the local link.  Using a very large\n   local link with thousands
    of hosts improves service discovery, but at\n   the cost of large amounts of multicast
    traffic.\n\n   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS
    is\n   more efficient, but requires configuration of DNS Update keys on the\n
    \  devices offering the services, which can be onerous for simple\n   devices
    like printers and network cameras.\n\n   Hence a compromise is needed, that provides
    easy service discovery\n   without requiring either large amounts of multicast
    traffic or\n   onerous configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
