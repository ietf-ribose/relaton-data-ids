abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Intelligent Use Task Force (IUTF) has responsibility for\n
    \  organizing Dedicated Interest Groups (DIG) to research, document and\n   validate
    solutions in the area of Intelligent Use Interfaces (IUI)\n   between the various
    components of the whole digital ecosystem (WDE),\n   the resulting intelligent
    global network (IGNet), the diversity of\n   on-line facilitation services that
    their IUI and IGNet may bring to\n   people and machines. This document describes
    the guidelines and\n   procedures for the formation, operations, experimentations
    and\n   publications of IUTF Dedicated Interest Groups and their internal and\n
    \  external relations with other SDOs (Standardization and Documentation\n   Organizations).
    Its publication as an IETF Draft is part of the IUCG\n   liaison.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
