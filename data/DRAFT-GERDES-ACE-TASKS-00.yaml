abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms
    of\n   processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   Due to the limitations
    of the constrained nodes it is especially\n   important to develop a light-weight
    security solution which is\n   adjusted to the relevant security objectives of
    each participating\n   party in this environment.  Necessary security measures
    must be\n   identified and applied where needed.\n\n   In this document, the required
    security related tasks are identified\n   as guidance for the development of authentication
    and authorization\n   solutions for constrained environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
