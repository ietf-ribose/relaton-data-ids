abstract:
  content: "<p>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming inorder
    to stimulate discussion. This proposal is a middle groundbetween the NOID and
    CB128 proposals.This proposed solution relies on verification the crypto-basedidentifier
    properties (using public-key crypto during uncommonoperations), while allowing
    locator rewriting by (border) routers,with no per-packet overhead. The solution
    does have something whichcould be viewed as a 'stack name' type of identifier,
    but this isn'texposed to upper layer protocols. Instead it ensures that all upperlayer
    protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting whilestill seeing a stable
    IPv6 address, even though the addressinternally consists of 64-bits worth of subnet
    locator plus 64-bitsof crypto-based identifier.This solution (and this draft)
    is remarkably similar to draft-nordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt; only issues related
    to prevention ofredirection attacks differ.</p>"
