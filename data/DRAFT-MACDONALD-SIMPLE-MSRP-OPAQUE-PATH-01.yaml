abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy
    and\ntopology hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address of\ntheir systems.
    \ This limitation is due to the fact that MSRP Path\nheaders contain physical
    IP addresses.  This document describes a\nmechanism which adds a level of indirection
    to allow privacy and\ntopology hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middle\nfrom
    learning the IP Address and port information of the MSRP client.\nIt also defines
    the option tag msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.\n\t </p>\n      "
