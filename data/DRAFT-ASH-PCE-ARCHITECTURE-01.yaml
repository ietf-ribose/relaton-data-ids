abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block
    for\ntraffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nand
    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path\ncomputation
    in large, multi-domain, multi-region or multi-layers\nnetworks is highly complex
    and may require special computational\ncomponents and cooperation between the
    different network domains.\n\nThis document specifies the architecture for a Path
    Computation Element\n(PCE)-based model to address this problem space.\n\t </p>\n
