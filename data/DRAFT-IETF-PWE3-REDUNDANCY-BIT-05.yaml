abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling
    of\n   redundant pseudowires (PWs) between their termination points. A set\n   of
    redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in\n   single-segment
    pseudowire (SS-PW) applications, or between\n   terminating provider edge (T-PE)
    nodes in multi-segment pseudowire\n   (MS-PW) applications.\n\n   In order for
    the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use\n   for forwarding PW packets
    to one another, a new status bit is needed\n   to indicate a preferential forwarding
    status of Active or Standby for\n   each PW in a redundant set.\n\n   In addition,
    a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes to\n   coordinate a switchover
    operation of the PW.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
