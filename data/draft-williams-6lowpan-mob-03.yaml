abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN communityregarding
    mobile usage scenarios. Mobility considerations isrequired for the deployment
    of SmartGrids. The mobility analysis forSmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is required
    to ensure properperformance for the mobile usage cases. Also, mobility in 6LoWPANsensor
    networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPANarchitecture. Hence it is
    best to have mobility as a considerationupfront rather than an after thought in
    the development of 6LoWPANmilestones. This document provides a mobility perspective
    to the6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.</p>"
