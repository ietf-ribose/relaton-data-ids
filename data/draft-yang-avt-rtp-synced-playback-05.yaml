abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not renderthe
    same picture and the associated audio at the same moment. Thevariation in end-to-end
    delay that resulted in such asynchronousplayback between users is referred to
    as inter-user playback delay.Unicast based rapid acquisition of multicast RTP
    sessions (RAMS) asspecified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] is an
    importanttechnique in achieving fast channel switching in IPTV as well asother
    multicast applications. In addition, RAMS also significantlyrelaxes the requirement
    of relatively short random access pointperiod in encoding of video streams in
    multicast applications, thusallowing significantly improved compression efficiency.
    However, onthe other hand, the use of RAMS increases inter-user playback delay,which
    makes users receiving the same multicast session playback thesame content asynchronously.
    This document specifies a mechanism tohelp reduce inter-user playback delay caused
    by the use of RAMS.</p>"
