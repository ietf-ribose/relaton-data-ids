abstract:
- content: "<p>Under certain circumstances the desired effects of diversion can be
    achieved with no per-packet transport overhead. This draft describes these circumstances
    as well as the per-packet bearer processing and general signaling requirements
    of some proposals that strive to remove the need for this overhead. The first
    proposal is referred to as Zero-Overhead Diversion (ZOD). The second is referred
    to as More Robust Zero-Overhead Diversion (MR. ZOD). Mobile IP and load distribution
    are examples of the useful application of diversion.</p>"
