abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> This document specifies an extension to the AAA/EAP authentication\n
    \  and key management framework that allows an EAP peer to perform fast\n   re-authentications
    with the local EAP server after an initial full\n   EAP authentication using a
    legacy EAP method with the same or another\n   EAP server.  EAP-FRAP eliminates
    the need for exchanges between the\n   local EAP server and the home EAP server
    each time the EAP peers is\n   authenticated.  In wireless networks, this allows
    the mobile device\n   to reduce hand-off delays.  The EAP-FRAP extension does
    not require\n   changes in underlying layer protocols.  Which makes is back-ward\n
    \  compatible with existing infrastructures and easily deployable with\n   minimal
    costs.\n\t </p>\n      "
