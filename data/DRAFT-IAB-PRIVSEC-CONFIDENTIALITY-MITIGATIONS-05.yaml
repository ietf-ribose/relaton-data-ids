abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations
    of\n   pervasive attack on Internet communications.  In this document we\n   survey
    the mitigations to those threats which are currently available\n   or which might
    plausibly be deployed.  We discuss these primarily in\n   the context of Internet
    protocol design, focusing on robustness to\n   pervasive monitoring and avoidance
    of unwanted cross-mitigation\n   impacts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
