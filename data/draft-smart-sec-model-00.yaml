abstract:
  content: "<p>The first step in creating a secure Internet is to build a model ofthe
    security requirements of the real world entities involved andhow those real world
    entities act on the Internet through the agencyof networked computers. This document
    presents a minimal model as astarting point for discussion. In this model: o The
    real world is composed of entities, each being: (a) anindependent legal entity;
    or (b) a sub-entity of another entity(creating a multi-level hierarchy).o Running
    code is characterized by: (a) the entity that it acts onbehalf of; and (b) the
    entity that controls the environment inwhich the code executes.o The environment
    can run on a bare unmanaged machine or it can bea virtual environment which is
    code controlled by another entity.o We can model communication between machines
    as a sequence ofrequests and assertions. The security question becomes: whichrequests
    to honour. What is known about the provenance of therequests and assertions is
    typically crucial.o Security can take place at different network layers and securityinformation
    must be passed between the layers along with the data.</p>"
