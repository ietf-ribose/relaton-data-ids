abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors
    to\n   enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  In scope of\n
    \  a solution for Distributed Mobility Management is the maintenance of\n   IP
    sessions and IP address continuity when mobile nodes get a new\n   mobility anchor
    assigned during handover.  This document proposes the\n   use of identifier-locator
    split concepts to achieve optimal routing\n   of data packets to a mobile node's
    current mobility anchor.  The use\n   of per-host locator IP addresses allows
    translation of addresses\n   within the mobile operator network to route packets
    to the mobile\n   node's current mobility anchor, while address translation is
    kept\n   transparent to the communication endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
