abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected
    to a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  It is based on DHCPv6 packet
    filtering at the layer 2 device at which the packets are received.  A similar
    mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'); hence,
    it is desirable that similar functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.  This
    document specifies a Best Current Practice for the implementation of DHCPv6-Shield.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
