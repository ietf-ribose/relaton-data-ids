abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48
    blocks\nin most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted that\nrecommendation
    in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005.\nThis document revisits and
    updates the RFC 3177 recommendations on\nthe assignment of IPv6 address space
    to end sites.  The exact choice\nof how much address space to assign end sites
    is a policy issue under\nthe purview of the RIRs, subject to IPv6 architectural
    and\noperational considerations. This document reviews the architectural\nand
    operational considerations of end site assignments as well as the\nmotivations
    behind the original 3177 recommendations. Moreover, the\ndocument clarifies that
    a one-size-fits-all recommendation of /48 is\nnot nuanced enough for the broad
    range of end sites and is no longer\nrecommended as a single default.\n\nThis
    document updates and replaces RFC 3177.\n\t </p>\n      "
