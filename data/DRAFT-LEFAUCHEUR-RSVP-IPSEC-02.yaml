abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RSVP-IPSEC] defines RSVP extensions for IPsec which permit
    support\n   of reservations for individual IPsec flows, but it does not support\n
    \  aggregate reservations between the IPsec devices with Diffserv\n   [DIFFSERV]
    classification and scheduling.  Conversely, [RSVP-AGG]\n   defines how to aggregate
    individual RSVP reservations over Aggregate\n   IP reservations when the aggregation
    region supports Diffserv, but it\n   does not address the case where the Aggregator
    and Deaggregator use\n   IPsec.  Also, [RSVP-AGG] does not address the case where
    multiple\n   Aggregate reservations are needed for the same DSCP from the same\n
    \  Aggregator to the same Deaggregator.  However, there are scenarios\n   requiring
    aggregate reservations for IPsec tunnels or requiring\n   multiple aggregate reservations
    for the same DSCP from a given\n   Aggregator to a given Deaggregator.  This document
    specifies the\n   incremental RSVP extensions beyond those defined in [RSVP-IPSEC]
    and\n   [RSVP-AGG] to support such reservations.\n\t </p>\n      "
