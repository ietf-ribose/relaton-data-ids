abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with
    performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLO). These metrics,
    referred to as Precision Availability Metrics (PAM), can be used to assess the
    service levels that are being delivered. Specifically, PAM can be used to assess
    whether a service is provided in compliance with its specified quality, i.e.,
    in accordance with its defined SLOs.</p>"
