abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Link State PDU flooding rates in use are much slower than what
    modern\n   networks can support.  The use of IS-IS at larger scale requires\n
    \  faster flooding rates to achieve desired convergence goals.  This\n   document
    discusses issues associated with increasing flooding rates\n   and some recommended
    practices which allow faster flooding rates to\n   be used safely.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
