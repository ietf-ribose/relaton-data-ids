abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rapid increase in the amount and type of traffic makes
    it\n   significantly more challenging for operational and management\n   applications
    to maintain the network and deploy new services. This\n   is the root cause of
    one of the major challenges that network\n   operators (service providers, SME,
    etc) are facing today. The\n   operators are obliged to create a simplified view
    of their network\n   infrastructure that can help network engineers to use such
    a\n   simplified model rather than manipulating individual devices. In this\n
    \  context, providing network operators with a set of standard generic\n   YANG-based
    data models that enable management and automation of\n   services on their network
    is essential.\n   This document describes what has to be addressed in order to
    equip\n   service providers with the means to quickly and dynamically\n   create/query/scale/update/delete
    the services they want to offer.\n   This may include a variety of different service
    enabling scenarios\n   and in particular VPN management from an individual to
    a data center,\n   within a data center or among a set of physical or virtualized
    data\n   centers that belong to an organization or different organizations.\n\n\n\t
