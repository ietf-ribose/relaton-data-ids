abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In a strong password-based protocol, the only thing the client needsto
    know is the user's password, and an eavesdropper, or someoneimpersonating either
    end, cannot do off-line password-guessingattacks. This sort of protocol can be
    used for credentials download,or for mutual authentication. Although password-based
    mutualauthentication protocols can be used for credentials download, theyare designed
    with some properties (such as not storing a password-equivalent at the server)
    that are not important in a credentials-download protocol. Therefore, a protocol
    designed specifically forcredentials download can be fewer messages, higher performance
    at theserver, and allow the server to operate in a stateless manner.Therefore
    it is possible, even likely, that different protocols mightbe preferable in one
    case (credentials download) than another.</p>"
