abstract:
  content: "<p>The DNS protocol has many things to fix or improve, but this is difficult
    to do because changing the protocol is very hard. This paper explores the good
    and bad features of the protocol, and calls for an effort too make the protocol
    flexible enough that it can evolve in the future.</p>"
