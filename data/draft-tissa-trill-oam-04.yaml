abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a solution suite for TRILL data plane monitoring
    and failure detection. Methods presented herein allow in- cooperating IP payloads,
    exercising multi-paths, verifying multicast trees, locating end stations, virtual
    segments and diagnosing connectivity problems. ICMP protocol is proposed as framework
    for error reporting. Document also presents network wide health monitoring, distribution
    and reporting methods that are intended for efficient troubleshooting.</p>"
