abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many distributed applications may benefit from a high bandwidth\n
    \  connection to the Internet. However, this requires high bandwidth\n   links
    between remotes sites.\n \n   A low-cost solution to deliver high bandwidth services
    over wide\n   geographical areas via the use of broadcast satellite networks has\n
    \  been proposed by [ASBD].\n \n   However, this solution is based on low cost
    receivers with zero\n   bandwidth return. Connection over the satellite link is
    therefore\n   unidirectional. The integration of these satellite networks with
    the\n   Internet requires changes in common routing protocols.\n\t </p>\n      "
