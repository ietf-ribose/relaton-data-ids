abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document standardizes three media types -- application/xml,\napplication/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    and application/xml-dtd --\nfor use in exchanging network entities that are related
    to the\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) while deprecating text/xml and text/\nxml-external-parsed-entity.
    \ This document also standardizes a\nconvention (using the suffix '+xml') for
    naming media types outside\nof these five types when those media types represent
    XML MIME\nentities.  XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the\nHyperText
    Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral\npart of the WebDAV protocol
    for remote web authoring, and are\nexpected to have utility in many domains.\n\nMajor
    differences from [RFC3023] are deprecation of text/xml and\ntext/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    the addition of XPointer and XML\nBase as fragment identifiers and base URIs,
    respectively, mention of\nthe XPointer Registry, and updating of many references.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
