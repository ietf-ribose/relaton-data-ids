abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new OSPF flow specification (FlowSpec) Opaque
    Link State Advertisement (LSA) encoding format that can be used to distribute
    traffic flow specifications. Additionally, this document proposes to assign label
    for the FlowSpec route in order to generate one or more LSPs, which would improve
    the route lookup performance in the data plane. For the network not deploying
    BGP or the internal nodes in an AS, it is expected to extend IGP (Interior Gateway
    Protocol ) to distribute FlowSpec routes. One application is to mitigate denial-of-service
    attacks as close to the attacker as possible, the other is to generate LSPs for
    the FlowSpec routes in the network.</p>"
