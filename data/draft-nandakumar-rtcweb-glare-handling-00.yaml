abstract:
- content: <p>The RFC3264 Offer/Answer model specifies rule for the bilateral exchange
    of Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for setting up, updating
    and tearing down of multimedia streams. Rarely, there might be situations wherein
    either of the communicating parties, might end up being the offerer for updating
    an on-going session. This scenario is commonly known as "glare" condition and
    it needs to be handled nevertheless. This specification describes procedures for
    parties involved in an ongoing RTCWeb session to add new media in a glareless
    fashion. There are various ways this problem might be solved - this draft sketches
    out one possible solution to the problem.</p>
