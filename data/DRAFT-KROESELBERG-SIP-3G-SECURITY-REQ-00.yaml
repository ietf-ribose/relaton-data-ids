abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>At present based on a different protocol architecture, 3G wireless\nstandards
    start to become more and more IP-based. The upcoming set\nof 3G wireless specifications
    defined by 3GPP will include SIP\n[RFC2543] as the session control protocol for
    IP-based voice and\nmultimedia. An important requirement for introducing SIP is
    the\ndefinition of a security architecture protecting the session control\nsignaling.\nThis
    Internet Draft collects requirements for a SIP security\narchitecture that are
    related to the use of SIP in 3GPP wireless\nnetworks. It is intended to stimulate
    the discussion about SIP\nsecurity and is meant as a source of input for a requirements
    draft\non SIP security.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
