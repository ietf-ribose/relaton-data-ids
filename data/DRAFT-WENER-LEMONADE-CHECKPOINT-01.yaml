abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an IMAP extension that aids in allowing
    a \n   client to maintain mailbox synchronization without performing a deep\n
    \  sync after each connection. The goal is to minimize, but not \n   eliminate,
    the need for deep synchronizations. The extension defines\n   a way for a client
    to receive and acknowledge state change responses\n   from the server.\n\t </p>\n
