abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception incommunication
    services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance asthe signaling protocol for
    multimedia applications on the Internet.Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility
    management scheme thatutilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well
    as otherprotocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.Without
    providing any specific solution, this document presentspreliminary requirements
    and identifies the issues that need to beresolved in order to develop a mobility
    management scheme forsupporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and
