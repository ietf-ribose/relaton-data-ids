abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internationalization techniques that the IETF has adopted depended
    on\n   some assumptions about the way characters get added to Unicode.  Some\n
    \  of those assumptions turn out not to have been true.  Discussion is\n   necessary
    to determine how the IETF should respond to the new\n   understanding of how Unicode
    works.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
