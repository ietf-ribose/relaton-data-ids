abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private
    Network (VPN+) service. The purpose is to support the needs of new applications,
    particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an
    approach that is based on existing VPN and TE technologies and adds features that
    specific services require over and above traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will
    be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use
    in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.
    It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a combination of existing,
    modified, and new networking technologies. This document provides an overview
    of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential new work. It
    is not envisaged that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be deployed in a network
    and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs supported by a network will
    use VPN+ related techniques.</p>"
