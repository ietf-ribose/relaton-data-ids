abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain Name Registries (DNRs) may operate in special modes for certain
    periods of time enabling trademark holders to protect their rights during the
    introduction of a Top Level Domain (TLD). One of those special modes of operation
    is the Sunrise Period. The Sunrise Period allows trademark holders an advance
    opportunity to register domain names corresponding to their trademarks before
    names are generally available to the public. This document describes the format
    of a mark and a digitally signed mark used by trademark holders for registering
    domain names during the sunrise phase of generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs). Three
    types of mark objects are defined in this specification: registered trademarks,
    court-validated marks, and marks protected by statue or treaty.</p>"
