abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE
    \n   signaling may be used and extended to satisfy the requirements of the \n
    \  Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture specified \n   by
    the ITU-T. The requirements are in a companion document \n   \"Requirements for
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Usage and Extensions for \n   Automatically Switched
    Optical Network (ASON).\" \n\n   In particular, this document details the mechanisms
    for setting up \n   Soft Permanent Connections (SPC), the necessary extensions
    in \n   delivering full and logical call/connection separation support, the \n
    \  extended restart capabilities during control plane failures, extended \n   label
    usage and crankback signalling capability. \n    \n   The mechanisms proposed
    in this document are applicable to any \n   environment (including multi-area)
    and for any type of interface: \n   packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed,
    lambda or fiber \n   switching. \n\t </p>\n      "
