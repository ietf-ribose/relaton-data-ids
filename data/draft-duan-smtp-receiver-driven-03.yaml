abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Differentiated Mail Transfer Protocol (DMTP) provides simpleextensions
    to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enablereceivers to exercise greater
    control over the email deliveryprocess. The current SMTP-based email delivery
    architecture isfundamentally sender-driven and distinctly lacks receiver controlover
    the message delivery mechanisms. This document describes DMTPthat enables receivers
    to classify senders into three categories --allowed, denied, and unclassified
    -- and process the delivery ofmessages from each category independently. As is
    the currentpractice, receivers may directly accept messages from senders in theallowed
    category and decline senders in the denied category. Inaddition, DMTP receivers
    require senders in the unclassified categoryto store messages on the senders'
    own mail servers. Such messagesare retrieved only if and when the end receivers
    wish to do so. Bygranting greater control over message delivery to receivers andimposing
    greater message storage and maintenance overhead on senders,DMTP provides significant
    advantages in controlling spam. DMTPalso easily operates in conjunction with (but
    does not require) manycurrently deployed anti-spam techniques.</p>"
