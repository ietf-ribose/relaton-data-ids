abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,\nPE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,...,
    CEm.  If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the
    core, it is desirable for a core router \"P\"\ncarrying traffic to the failed
    edge router PEi to immediately restore\ntraffic by re-tunneling packets originally
    tunneled to PEi and\ndestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers
    that\nadvertised P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is\nhighly
    desirable to keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions on external
    connectivity. Thus (1) a core router should\nnot be required to learn any BGP
    prefix, (2) the size of the\nforwarding and routing tables in the core routers
    should be\nindependent of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) provisioning overhead\nshould
    be kept at minimum, (4) re-routing traffic without waiting for\nre-convergence
    must not cause loops, and (4) there should be no\nrestrictions on what edge routers
    advertise what prefixes. For\nlabeled prefixes, (6) the label stack on the packet
    must allow the\nrepair PEj to correctly forward the packet and (7) there must
    not be\nany need to perform more than one label lookup on any edge or core\nrouter
    during steady state\n\n\t </p>\n      "
