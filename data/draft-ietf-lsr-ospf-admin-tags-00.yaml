abstract:
- content: "<p>It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be
    able to associate tags with prefixes. Previously, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 were relegated
    to a single tag for AS External and Not-So-Stubby-Area (NSSA) prefixes. With the
    flexible encodings provided by OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attribute Advertisement and
    OSPFv3 Extended LSAs, multiple administrative tags may advertised for all types
    of prefixes. These administrative tags can be used for many applications including
    route redistribution policy, selective prefix prioritization, selective IP Fast-ReRoute
    (IPFRR) prefix protection, and many others. The ISIS protocol supports a similar
    mechanism that is described in RFC 5130.</p>"
