abstract:
  content: "<p>There are circumstances in RPKI operations where a resource holder's
    parent may not be able to, or may not choose to, facilitate full and proper registration
    of the holder's data. As in real life, the holder may form a relationship to their
    grandparent who is willing to aid the grandchild. This document describes simple
    procedures for doing so.</p>"
