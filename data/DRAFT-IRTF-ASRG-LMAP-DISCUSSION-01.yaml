abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP) is the general
    term\n   for a family of proposed protocols to help address the spam problem\n
    \  by permitting domains to publish the set of SMTP clients which may\n   use
    their name in the EHLO/HELO and MAIL FROM fields.  SMTP servers\n   can use this
    information to determine if a client is consensually\n   using a domains name.
    \ This document discusses the applicability, and\n   the costs and benefits of
    wide-spread deployment of the protocol\n   family.\n\t </p>\n      "
