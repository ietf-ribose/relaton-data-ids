abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3 have\n
    \  instead adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman and elliptic-curve\n   Diffie-Hellman
    as the primary cryptographic key exchange mechanism\n   used in TLS.  This document
    describes an optional configuration for\n   TLS servers that allows for the use
    of a static Diffie-Hellman\n   private key for all TLS connections made to the
    server.  Passive\n   monitoring of TLS connections can be enabled by installing
    a\n   corresponding copy of this key in each monitoring device.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
