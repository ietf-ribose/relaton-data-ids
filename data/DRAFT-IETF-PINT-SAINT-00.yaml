abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This  Internet Draft has arisen  out of  work  concentrating
    \ on  the\n   interconnection  of IP  and the  Public  Switched  Telephone  Network\n
    \  (PSTN) undertaken within the PINT working group.  Efforts within this\n   group
    have,  to date, concentrated on the initiation of PSTN services\n   from the Internet.\n
    \n   This Internet Draft aims  to describe a possible architecture for the\n   implementation
    of services initiated from  the PSTN such as,  but not\n   limited  to,  Internet
    Call Waiting  (ICW).  It also  identifies  the\n   possibility  of using this
    class of service,  in conjunction with the\n   PINT work already undertaken,  in
    order to provide a third flavour of\n   service.\n \n   This Internet Draft deliberately
    does not to define the protocols for\n   these kinds of services, although descriptions
    contained within it do\n   use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) terminology.\n
    \n   The purpose  of this  Internet Draft  is to  ascertain  the level  of\n   interest
    in pursuing this area of work. It is submitted with the goal\n   of forming the
    basis of an Informational RFC and thereby further work\n   on the standardisation
    of the  provision of  these kinds of services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
