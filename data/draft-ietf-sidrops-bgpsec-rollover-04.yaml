abstract:
- content: "<p>Certification Authorities (CAs) within the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) manage BGPsec router certificates as well as RPKI certificates. The rollover
    of BGPsec router certificates must be carefully performed in order to synchronize
    the distribution of router public keys with BGPsec UPDATE messages verified with
    those router public keys. This document describes a safe rollover process, and
    it discusses when and why the rollover of BGPsec router certificates is necessary.
    When this rollover process is followed, the rollover will be performed without
    routing information being lost.</p>"
