abstract:
- content: "<p>The path vector extension [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector] has extended
    the original ALTO protocol [RFC7285] with the ability to represent a more detailed
    view of the network, containing not only end-to-end metrics but also information
    about shared bottlenecks. However, the view computed by straw man algorithms can
    contain redundant information and result in unnecessary communication overhead.
    The situation gets even worse when certain ALTO extensions are enabled, for example,
    the incremental update extension [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse] which continuously
    pushes data changes to ALTO clients. Redundant information can trigger unnecessary
    updates. In this document, an algorithm is described which can effectively reduce
    the redundancy in the network view while still providing the same information
    as in the original path vectors. The algorithm is fully compatible with the path
    vector extension and has several by- products which can be leveraged by other
    extensions to achieve better performance.</p>"
