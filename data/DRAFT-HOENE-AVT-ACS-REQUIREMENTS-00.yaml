abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the requirements of an audio communication
    \nsystem (ACS) for acoustic content, especially speech and music. The \nACS consists
    of all components above the IP layer and below a digital \nPCM audio interface.
    These include codec, jitter buffer, and \ntransport. \n\nThe goal of the ACS is
    to provide a bidirectional acoustic \ncommunication between any two Internet hosts
    at a good quality, \nconstrained only by the available resources at the hosts
    and the \ncharacteristics of the transmission path between both hosts. \n\nThe
    intention of the document is to provide the requirements for a \ncodec that is
    solely intended for the Internet, to provide the \nrequirements for the codec's
    payload specification, and to define the \nrequirements on the transport protocol.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
