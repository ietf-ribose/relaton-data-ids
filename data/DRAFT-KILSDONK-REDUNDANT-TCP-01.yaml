    \noutages during the upgrading of a router's software.  In this way, \ndisruptions
    to the network community are avoided.  The upgrade process \ndefinition comprises
    requirements for inserting a replacement router \nor upgrading the software in
    a working router within an operational \nnetwork.  To do this, it maximizes the
    use of accepted internet \nstandards with minimal alteration.\n\t </p>\n      "
