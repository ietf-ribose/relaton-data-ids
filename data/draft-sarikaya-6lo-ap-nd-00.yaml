abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension of 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery for
    application in low-power and lossy networks. The protocol is specified to be protected
    and to support multi-hop operation. A node computes its Cryptographic, Unique
    Interface ID, and associates one or more of its Registered Addresses with that
    Cryptographic ID in place of the EUI-64 that is used in RFC 6775 to uniquely identify
    the interface of the Registered Address. Once an address is registered with a
    Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify the state in the 6LR and
    6LBR regarding the Registered Address.</p>"
