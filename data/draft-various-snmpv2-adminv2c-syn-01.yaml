abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    This document describes a transitional approach, using the SNMP version 1 community-based
    administrative model in combination with the SNMP version 2 protocol operations.
    This hybrid, which is halfway between the SNMPv1 framework and the SNMPv2 framework
    is called SNMPv1.5 to reflect its character and to avoid confusion in the marketplace
    were it to be called SNMPv1 or SNMPv2. The document also describes a multi-lingual
    implementation including the mapping of the SNMPv1.5 authentication mechanism
    onto the SNMPv2 administrative model, including an appropriate set of MIB objects.
    This updated version of the document is the output of the SNMPv2* meeting held
    in Dallas on Friday, December 8th, 1995. This updated version contains change
    bars to highlight the differences.</p>"
