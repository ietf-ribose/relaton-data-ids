abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify
    the\n   source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be\n   presented
    by endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the\n   same source.\n\n
    \  Regional regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text\n   in
    multi-party calls.  RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use\n   traditional RTP
    functions for source identification, but the mixer\n   source switching performance
    is limited when using the default\n   transmission with redundancy.\n\n   An enhancement
    for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided in the\n   present specification,
    suitable for a centralized conference model\n   that enables source identification
    and efficient source switching.\n   The intended use is for real-time text mixers
    and multi-party-aware\n   participant endpoints.  The mechanism builds on use
    of the CSRC list\n   in the RTP packet and an extended packet format 'text/rex'.\n\n
    \  A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a\n   participant
    can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream.\n   The capability is
    indicated by the media subtype \"text/rex\".\n\n   The document updates RFC 4102[RFC4102]
    and RFC 4103[RFC4103]\n\n   A brief description about how a mixer can format text
    for the case\n   when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.\n\n\t
