abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP (RFC7252) comes with a conservative base congestion control scheme.
    Advanced congestion control schemes can be defined where better performance is
    desired for a certain area of application. This document is a strawman for a set
    of questions that could be used in qualifying a CoAP advanced congestion control
    scheme.</p>"
