abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140 may
    be\n   usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of Internet and more\n
    \  general lore.  This document extends the menagerie to the seminal\n   fable
    of the \"Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch\", as depicted in the Monty\n   Python film
    \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", as well as \"Spamalot\",\n   the musical
    inspired by the movie.\n\nSpamalot\n\n   The relevance of the musical \"Spamalot\"
    to Internet lore should be\n   obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see
    also Section 1\n   (\"What is Spam*?\") of RFC2635.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
