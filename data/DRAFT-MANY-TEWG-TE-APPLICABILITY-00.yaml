abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes the applicability of Multiprotocol Label\nSwitching
    (MPLS) to traffic engineering in IP networks. Special\nconsiderations for deployment
    of MPLS for traffic engineering in\noperational contexts are discussed and the
    limitations of the\nMPLS approach to traffic engineering are highlighted.\nThis
    document is intended for the Internet informational track.\n\t </p>\n      "
