abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features.\nA
    feature may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, having\na self-contained
    role.\nHowever, the introduction and modification of features may result in\nundesired
    behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction -\nFI for short.\n\nThis
    document specifies the architecture of a distributed feature mana-\nger that proposes
    the resolution of feature interactions. The resolu-\ntion may be done locally,
    or with cooperation between different nodes.\n\nThe resolution method is left
    to the implementation. In this document we provide an example of one resolution
    method, based on feature\ninterdiction, as described by a set of deontic formulas.\n\n\t
