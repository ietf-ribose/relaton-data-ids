abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) has been standardized
    to enable\n   carrier-grade packet transport and to complement converged packet\n
    \  network deployments.  The most attractive features of MPLS-TP are the\n   OAM
    functions.  These functions enable maintenance tools that may be\n   exploited
    by network operators and service providers for fault\n   location, survivability,
    performance monitoring, in-service and out-\n   of-service measurements.\n\n   One
    of the most important mechanisms that is common for transport\n   network operation
    is fault localisation.  A segment monitoring\n   function of a transport path
    is effective in terms of extension of\n   the maintenance work and indispensable,
    particularly when the OAM\n   function is activated only between end points.  However,
    the current\n   approach defined for MPLS-TP of segment monitoring has some\n
    \  drawbacks.  This document elaborates on the problem statement for the\n   Sub-path
    Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provide monitoring of a\n   segment of a set
    of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs).  Based on the\n   identified problems, this
    document provides considerations for the\n   specification of new requirements
    to consider a new improved\n   mechanism for hitless transport path segment monitoring
    to be named\n   Enhanced Path Segment Monitoring (EPSM).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
