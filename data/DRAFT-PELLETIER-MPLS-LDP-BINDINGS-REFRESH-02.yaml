abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  There are situations when there is a need for performing consistency\n
    \ checks for LDP binding state (address/label bindings) exchanged\n  between LDP
    speakers. For instance, a state refresh may be required\n  to detect and purge
    stale bindings received by an LDP speaker, which\n  have resulted from an in-service
    software upgrade. This document\n  specifies mechanics that allow a sender LDP
    speaker to enclose the\n  initial binding advertisements (or re-advertisements)
    between\n  explicit START and END of binding markers, thus helping the\n  receiving
    LDP speaker to detect and purge any extra/stale binding\n  state previously learnt
    from the sender. In addition to the\n  definition of new LDP Notification message
    status codes for bindings\n  refresh, this document also extends LDP base specification
    by\n  introducing the concept of \"Wildcard Address\" and a new \"Wildcard\n  Address
    Request\" message.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
