abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2) does not have
    a\n   mechanism for a node to repel transit traffic if it is on the\n   shortest
    path.  This document assigns a new bit (Host-bit) in the\n   OSPF Router-LSA bit
    registry and in the OSPF Router Informational\n   Capability Bits Registry that
    enables a host router to advertise that\n   it is a non-transit router.  It also
    describes the changes needed to\n   support the Host-bit in the domain.  In addition,
    this document\n   updates OSPF Stub Router Advertisement (RFC6987) to advertise
    for\n   type-2 External and NSSA LSAs with a high cost in order to repel\n   traffic
    effectively.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
