abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicast Receiver Access Control must be enforced at both
    the\n   application level and at the network level.  The control at the two\n
    \  levels must be correlated, to ensure that only a legitimate group\n   member
    at the application level is permitted to join group at the\n   network level.
    \ We assume that authentication and authorization at\n   the application level
    are provided by Extensible Authentication\n   Protocol (EAP) exchanges.  We describe
    how to use Protocol for\n   carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
    to transport the\n   EAP packets in such a way that authententication and authorization\n
    \  can be easily achieved at the network level and that the necessary\n   coordination
    is achieved.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
