abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ICN has been proposing and evaluating novel ways for reaching
    on-line\n   content in upcoming Future Internet environments, leveraging\n   intrinsic
    capabilities such as naming, caching and built-in security.\n   In order to fully
    realize the capabilities and vision provided by\n   ICN, supportive management
    procedures need to be ensured, providing\n   the architectures, and the elements
    that figure in them, with the\n   means to facilitate the delivery of content
    and the operation of the\n   network.  In the current Internet, these management
    aspects have been\n   being developed and enhanced in parallel to the existing
    data\n   protocol and mechanisms, resulting in a plethora of different and\n   hard-to-integrate
    approaches, but still fulfil indispensable roles\n   and actions for the operation
    and well-being of the network.  We\n   consider that the availability of management
    mechanisms for ICN will\n   foster deployment and, as such, should be tackled
    still in the design\n   and experimentation phases.  In this way, this document
    addresses and\n   identifies ICN management considerations, under two different\n
    \  settings: a) achieving management operations using ICN-based\n   mechanisms
    and, b) how to manage ICN procedures themselves.  The\n   ultimate goal is to
    provide the necessary breadth to establish\n   management mechanisms deployment
    guidelines in a common way\n   throughout the existing ICN ecosystem of architectures.\n\n\t
