abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cyber defenders frequently rely on Indicators of Compromise
    (IoCs) to\n   identify, trace, and block malicious activity in networks or on\n
    \  endpoints.  This draft reviews the fundamentals, opportunities,\n   operational
    limitations, and best practices of IoC use.  It\n   highlights the need for IoCs
    to be detectable in implementations of\n   Internet protocols, tools, and technologies
    - both for the IoCs'\n   initial discovery and their use in detection - and provides
    a\n   foundation for new approaches to operational challenges in network\n   security.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
