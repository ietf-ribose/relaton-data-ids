abstract:
  content: "<p>SIP is extended by the SIP-events framework to provide subscriptionsand
    notifications of SIP events. One example of such eventnotification mechanism is
    'presence' and this presence information iscarried in Presence Information Data
    Format (PIDF) documents.The SIP PUBLISH method specified in RFC 3903 carrying
    a PIDF documentis typically used when presentities publish their own presence
    sincethese presentities are typically the source of the information.However, there
    are cases when the presentity is not the direct sourceof the presence information.
    One such example is locationinformation where the end host may obtain a reference
    to locationinformation as opposed to as a value. The endpoint is typically notinterested
    in knowing its own location information, but other usersor entities might be.
    So, if the endpoint gets its own locationinformation with a reference and wants
    to publish it embedded in itspresence information, it first needs to de-reference
    it for getting avalue, and then it can embed that value in its presence information.While
    this is certainly a correct sequence, it adds a round-trip tothe presence publication,
    in addition to a demand processing powerand network bandwidth consumption.There
    is a need for a mechanism that the presentity can use topublish indirect references,
    such as indirect location references.This document discusses a few variants that
    may be used to providethis functionality.</p>"
