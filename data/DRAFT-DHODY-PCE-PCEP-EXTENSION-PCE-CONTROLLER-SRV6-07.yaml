abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.\n\n   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC)
    can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it
    with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing it.  This
    document specifies\n   the procedures and PCEP extensions when a PCE-based controller
    is\n   also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on the\n   routers,
    in addition to computing the paths for packet flows in the\n   for Segment Routing
    (SR) in IPv6 (SRv6) network and telling the edge\n   routers what instructions
    to attach to packets as they enter the\n   network.  PCECC is further enhanced
    for SRv6 SID (Segment Identifier)\n   allocation and distribution.\n\n\t </p>\n
