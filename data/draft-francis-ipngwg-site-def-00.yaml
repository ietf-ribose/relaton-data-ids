abstract:
- content: "<p>A key concept in IPv6 is that of the site. Unfortunately, there is
    no rigorous definition of a site. Rather, a site is only loosely and informally
    defined as 'a region of topology that belongs to a single organization and is
    located within a single geographic location' [1].</p>"
