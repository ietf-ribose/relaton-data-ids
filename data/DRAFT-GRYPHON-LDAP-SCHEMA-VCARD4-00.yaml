abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document works to harmonize the vCard directory information
    card\nand Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) standards by\nextending
    both standards to support a common directory card entity.\n\nAdditional LDAP attributes
    and object classes, and additional\nproperties for vCard are defined. A standard
    mapping process between\nthe two designed to support vCard's goal of being a transport
    format\nbetween directories (not just LDAP) is defined.\n\t </p>\n      "
