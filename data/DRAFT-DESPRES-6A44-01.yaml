abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a
    last\n   resort IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081].  However,\n   because
    it is designed to work without involvement of Internet\n   service providers,
    it has significant limitations (connectivity\n   between IPv6 native addresses
    and Teredo addresses is uncertain;\n   connectivity between Teredo addresses fails
    for some combinations of\n   NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that,
    being base on ISP\n   cooperation, avoids these limitations. 6a44 uses specific
    prefixes\n   assigned by local ISPs (rather than the anycast address used by\n
    \  Teredo, an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd).  The\n   specification
    is complete enough for actual deployment, including\n   with independently written
    codes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
