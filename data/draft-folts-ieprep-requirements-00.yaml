abstract:
- content: "<p>Priority telecommunication capabilities are required to support critical
    emergency communications through the public telecommunications infrastructure
    to support disaster recovery operations for saving lives and restoring community
    infrastructure. Many important issues are identified that are essential to ensuring
    effective emergency telecommunications capabilities are established in Internet-based
    infrastructures. The term 'communication session' is used instead of 'call' so
    that all modes of communication can be considered collectively; emergency telecommunication
    capabilities are not just limited to telephony traffic. No solutions are suggested,
    but the basic requirements are clearly identified for consideration by the ieprep
    Working Group of the IETF.</p>"
