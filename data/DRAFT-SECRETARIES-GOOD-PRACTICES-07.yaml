abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in
    RFC\n   2418. However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in\n   value
    and scope, since the writing of RFC 2418. This document thus\n   provides a compilation
    of good practices and general guidelines\n   regarding the fulfilment of the role.\n\n
    \  This document is intended for established Working Group Secretaries,\n   individuals
    motivated by taking up that role, or anyone else simply\n   interested in understanding
    better the Working Group Secretary's\n   role. This document may also be useful
    for Working Group Chairs to\n   better appreciate and help develop the value of
    Working Group\n   Secretaries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
