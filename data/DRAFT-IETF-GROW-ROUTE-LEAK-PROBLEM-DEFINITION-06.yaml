abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing
    system, known as \"route leaks\", has received significant attention in recent
    years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet
    routing are labeled route leaks, but to date a common definition of the term has
    been lacking.  This document provides a working definition of route leaks while
    keeping in mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention.
    \ Further, this document attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different
    types of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet.  The aim is to
    provide a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks that have been observed
    and are of concern to the Internet user community as well as the network operator
    community.\n\t </p>\n      "
