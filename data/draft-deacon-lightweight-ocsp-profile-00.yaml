abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a lightweight profile of OCSP (RFC 2560) for
    use in very large PKI environments such as SSL/TLS, code signing and secure messaging.
    In these environments there exists a large client base (in the 100's of millions)
    and thus the ability to scale OCSP request handling is very important.</p>"
