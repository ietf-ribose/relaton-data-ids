abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the
    data\n   sink to the data source against request/ notification from the\n   source
    might be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop\n   exchange (with no reverse
    path from the sink to the source) may be\n   desired while updating resources
    in constrained systems looking for\n   maximized throughput with minimized resource
    consumption. CoAP\n   already provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange
    where The\n   receiving end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the\n   receiving
    end-point responds the sender with a status code\n   indicating \"the result of
    the attempt to understand and satisfy the\n   request\".\n\n   This draft introduces
    a header option: 'No-Response' to suppress\n   responses from the receiver and
    discusses exemplary use cases which\n   motivated this proposition based on real
    experience. This option\n   also provides granularity by allowing suppression
    of a typical class\n   or a combination of classes of responses. This option may
    be\n   effective for both unicast and multicast scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
