abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP and Integrated Services working groups have been working towards
    the goal of an 'Integrated Services Internet' where applications can request a
    Quality of Service (QoS) from the network in order to meet their end-to-end service
    requirement [1]. This document reviews various issues related to running RSVP
    and Integrated Service models over ATM and presents a model to address some of
    these issues. It is intended as a starting point for building an architectural
    framework to support RSVP/ATM Interworking.</p>"
