abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is a need
    for\nsimple mechanisms of IPv4 address allocation and name resolution. This\ndocument
    describes the behavior of the mini-DHCP server, a small scale\nDHCP server that
    is typically implemented as part of a home gateway.\n\nAs described in this document,
    the mini-DHCP server is capable of\nallocating addresses either in single or multi-segment
    networks. It\nsupports dynamic DNS, and is capable of automatically detecting
    the\npresence of a full-fledged DHCP server, or other mini-DHCP servers, and\nshutting
    down as required.\n\t </p>\n      "
