abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures
    for \nthe Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA), allowing for per-\nendpoint
    control of large scale NAT devices, which are put in place \nto cope with IPv4-address
    space completion.  The Diameter NAT Control \nApplication allows external devices
    to configure and manage a Large \nScale NAT (LSN) device - expanding the existing
    Diameter-based AAA \nand policy control capabilities with a NAT control component.
    These \nexternal devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a \nNetwork
    Access Server (NAS), or can be more centralized control plane \ndevices such as
    AAA-servers. DNCA establishes a context to commonly \nidentify and manage endpoints
    on a gateway or server, and a large \nscale NAT device. This includes, for example,
    the control of the \ntotal number of NAT-bindings allowed or the allocation of
    a specific \nNAT-binding for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows large
    \nscale NAT devices to provide information relevant to accounting \npurposes.\n\t
