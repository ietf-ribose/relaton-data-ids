abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN
    paths\n   (most likely encrypted) to traverse specific list of network\n   segments,
    some of which are SR enabled and others may be legacy\n   networks that do not
    support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E\n   quality.\n\n   The method described
    in this draft uses the principle of segment\n   routing to enforce a SD-WAN path'
    head-end selected route traversing\n   through a list of specific nodes of multiple
    network segments\n   without requiring the nodes in each network segment to have
    the\n   intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next\n   domain.
    Those networks over which the SD-WAN path traverse have at\n   least one SR enabled
    network, and some network segments (especially\n   the last mile access portion)
    being legacy networks (such as legacy\n   IPv4, IPv6 or others).\n\n\t </p>\n
