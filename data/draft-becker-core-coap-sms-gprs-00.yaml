abstract:
  content: "<p>The Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is frequently
    used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic devices.
    The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just as other typical low-power
    and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs. The design of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also
    applicable to telematic M2M devices. The adaption of CoAP to the SMS transport
    mechanism is described in this document.</p>"
