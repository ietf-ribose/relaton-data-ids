abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with
    multiple \n   physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows
    \n   for zero configuration of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise \n
    \  routing, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and \n   the
    ability to cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The design also supports \n   VLANs, and
    allows forwarding tables to be based on RBridge \n   destinations (rather than
    endnode destinations), which allows \n   internal routing tables to be substantially
    smaller than in \n   conventional bridge systems.  \n\n   This document is a work
    in progress; we invite you to participate on \n   the mailing list at http://www.postel.org/RBridge
    \ \n\t </p>\n      "
