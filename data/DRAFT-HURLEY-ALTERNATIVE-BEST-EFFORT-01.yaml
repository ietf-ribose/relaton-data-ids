abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Alternative Best-Effort (ABE) is a novel service for IP networks.
    It\noffers applications the choice between receiving a lower end-to-end\ndelay
    and receiving more overall throughput. Every best effort packet\nis tagged as
    either green or blue. Green packets receive a low, \nbounded queueing delay. To
    ensure blue packets do not suffer as a\nresult, green flows receive less throughput
    during bouts of\ncongestion.\n\t </p>\n      "
