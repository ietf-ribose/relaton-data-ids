abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document clarifies DNS response message interpretation
    to avoid\n   denial of service attacks using DNS responses.\n\n   In a recent
    DNS software assessment it has come to light that some\n   implementations respond
    to DNS response messages.  A loop occurs if\n   the receiver of this response
    responds with a response.\n\n   It was never explicitly stated that response messages
    must not be\n   answered.  This draft makes the statement explicit.\n\t </p>\n
