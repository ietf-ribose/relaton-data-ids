abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Registries for Internet and Web protocols fulfill a wide range
    of\n   tasks, ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type\n
    \  identifiers, all the way up to application-level protocols and\n   standards.
    \ This document summarizes some of the reasons of why,\n   when, and how to use
    registries.  It serves as an informative\n   reference for specification writers
    considering whether to create and\n   manage a registry, allowing them to better
    understand some of the\n   issues associated with certain design and operational
    decisions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
