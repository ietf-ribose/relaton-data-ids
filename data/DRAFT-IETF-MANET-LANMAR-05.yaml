abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) utilizes the concept of
    \nlandmark for scalable routing in large, mobile ad hoc networks.  \nIt relies
    on the notion of group mobility: i.e., a logical group \n(for example a team of
    coworkers at a convention) moves in a \ncoordinated fashion.  The existence of
    such logical group can be \nefficiently reflected in the addressing scheme.  It
    assumes that \nan IP like address is used consisting of a group ID (or subnet
    ID)\nand a host ID, i.e. &lt;Group ID, Host ID&gt;.  A landmark is dynamically\nelected
    in each group.  The route to a landmark is propagated \nthroughout the network
    using a Distance Vector mechanism.  \nSeparately, each node in the network uses
    a scoped routing \nalgorithm (e.g., FSR) to learn about routes within a given
    (max \nnumber of hops) scope.  To route a packet to a destination outside\nits
    scope, a node will direct the packet to the landmark \ncorresponding to the group
    ID of such destination.  Once the packet\napproaches the landmark, it will typically
    be routed directly to \nthe destination.  A solution to nodes outside of the scope
    of their \nlandmark (i.e., drifters) is also addressed in the draft.  Thus, \nby
    summarizing in the corresponding landmarks the routing \ninformation of remote
    groups of nodes  and by using the truncated \nlocal routing table, LANMAR dramatically
    reduces routing table size\nand routing update overhead in large networks.  The
    dynamic \nelection of landmarks enables LANMAR to cope with mobile \nenvironments.
    \ LANMAR is well suited to provide an efficient and \nscalable routing solution
    in large, mobile, ad hoc environments in\nwhich group behavior applies and high
    mobility renders traditional \nrouting schemes inefficient.\n\t </p>\n      "
