abstract:
- content: "<p>Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end security
    mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to the communicating endpoints,
    and not to any servers involved in delivering messages. Establishing keys to provide
    such protections is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two
    participants need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same time. In
    this document, we specify a key establishment protocol that provides efficient
    asynchronous group key establishment with forward secrecy and post-compromise
    security for groups in size ranging from two to thousands.</p>"
