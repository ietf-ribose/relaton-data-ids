abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.
    \ This\n   response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary\n
    \  rejected their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus no one\n   will
    answer, the call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that\n   future attempts
    to contact the same User Agent Server will likely\n   fail.  The initial use case
    driving the need for the 608 response\n   code is when the intermediary is an
    analytics engine.  In this case,\n   the rejection is by a machine or other process.
    \ This contrasts with\n   the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code, which a human
    at the target\n   User Agent Server indicated the user did not want the call.
    \ In some\n   jurisdictions this distinction is important.  This document also\n
    \  defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to\n   enable
    rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls\n   in error.  This
    provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers\n   that find their calls blocked.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
