abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Mobile IPv4 Registration Revocation mechanism
    whereby a mobility agent involved in providing Mobile IP services to a mobile
    node can notify the other mobility agent providing Mobile IP services to the same
    mobile node of the termination of this registration. The mechanism is also usable
    by a home agent to notify a co-located mobile node of the termination of its binding
    as well. Moreover, the mechanism provides for this notification to be acknowledged.
    A signaling mechanism already defined by the Mobile IPv4 protocol is leveraged
    as a way to inform a mobile node of the revocation of its binding. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
