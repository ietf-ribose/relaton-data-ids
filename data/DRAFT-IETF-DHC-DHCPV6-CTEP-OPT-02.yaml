abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly\n
    \  deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been\n   proposed.
    \ One such mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document\n   provides a tunnel
    discovery mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can\n   provide information about
    the available configured tunnel end points\n   to reach the IPv6 nodes which are
    separated by IPv4 networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
