abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The packet loss rate of each path between the source node and\ndestination
    node can be obtained through two methods, one is direct\nmeasurement, another
    approach is proposed in this document\ncalculating the packet loss rate based
    on the flow sensing parameter.\nThe core idea of the calculating approach is the
    flow sensing\nparameter, which can be used to calculate the packet loss rate of\neach
    path between the source node and destination node and select the\npath whose packet
    loss rate is smallest to be the data transmission\npath.\n\t </p>\n      "
