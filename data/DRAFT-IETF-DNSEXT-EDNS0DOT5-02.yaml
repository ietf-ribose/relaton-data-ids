abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>EDNS0 [EDNS0] specifies a general framework for extending the
    packet\nformat used by the Domain Name System protocols.  The framework\nincludes
    a simple version numbering scheme to allow the parties in a\nDNS protocol exchange
    to determine which extension features the other\nparty understands.  While having
    the advantage of simplicity, the\nversion numbering scheme as specified has drawbacks:\n-
    It provides no way to deprecate a protocol feature;\n- It provides no way to deploy
    experimental protocol features.\nThis note proposes to replace the monolithic
    version numbering\nmechanism with a mechanism for listing an explicit set of protocol\nfeatures
    that a particular implementation supports.  We retain\nversion numbering as a
    way of abbreviating the feature sets that we\nexpect to see in common use.\n\t
