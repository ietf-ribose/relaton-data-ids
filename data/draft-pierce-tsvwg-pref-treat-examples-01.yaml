abstract:
- content: "<p>Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure that
    mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. [Pierce] describes
    the requirements, one of which is to provide preferential treatment to higher
    priority calls. IEPS refers to a set of capabilities used to provide a higher
    probability of call completion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel,
    usually from ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of preferential
    treatment. This informational memo describes some of the methods which may be
    applied to provide that preferential treatment.</p>"
