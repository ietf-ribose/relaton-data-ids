abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an informational document that describes the transport protocol
    interface primitives provided by the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Lightweight
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) transport protocols. It identifies the datagram
    services exposed to applications and how an application can configure and use
    the features offered by the Internet datagram transport service. RFCxxxx documents
    the usage of transport features provided by IETF transport protocols, describing
    the way UDP, UDP-Lite and other transport protocols expose their services to applications
    and how an application can configure and use the features that make up these services.
    This document provides input to and context for that document, as well as offering
    a road map to documentation that may be of help to users of the UDP and UDP-Lite
    protocols. XXX RFC-Ed Note - please replace RFCxxxx with the published RFC number
    for I-D.ietf-taps-transports-usage, when these documents are both published XXX.</p>"
