abstract:
- content: "<p>Almost all VoIP endpoints, especially SIP and RTCWEB ones, make use
    of RTP to tranport media frames in real-time and communicate with each other.
    Since RTP uses UDP, the presence of network elements that filter UDP packets and/or
    only allow some protocols like SMTP or HTTP to pass through would make such a
    communication very hard to accomplish, if not impossible. This draft describes
    a way to implement an HTTP Fallback for RTP media streams, that is, a way to effectively
    encapsulate RTP packets in HTTP messages in order to traverse proxies and firewalls.</p>"
