abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPF requires a router to recalculate its routing table whenever
    it\nreceives a new router or network LSA.  However, a topology change,\nsuch as
    a router down event, may cause a number of new LSAs to be\ngenerated.  These LSAs
    may arrive at a router at different times.  In\norder to avoid several routing
    table calculations in quick succession\nin such cases, commercial routers enforce
    a hold time between\nsuccessive routing table calculations.  The hold time based
    schemes,\nwhile limiting the number of routing table calculations, may also\ncause
    undesirable delays in convergence to the topology change.  This\nID describes
    an alternate approach to schedule routing table\ncalculations, called LSA Correlation.
    \ Rather than using individual\nLSAs as triggers for routing table calculations,
    LSA Correlation\nscheme correlates the information in the LSAs to identify the\ntopology
    change.  A routing table calculation can be performed when\nthe topology change
    has been identified, which could span multiple\nLSAs.\n\t </p>\n      "
