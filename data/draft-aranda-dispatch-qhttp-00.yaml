abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes an application level protocol for the standardcommunication
    of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocolbased on Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basisfor the World Wide Web, and Session Description
    Protocol (SDP).Quality HTTP (Q-HTTP) provides a mechanism for latency, jitter,bandwidth
    an packet loss negotiation and monitoring, alertingwhenever one of the negotiated
    conditions is violated.Implementation details on the actions to be triggered uponreception/detection
    of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are outof scope of this draft, it is application
    dependant (e.g. increasequality, reduce bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g.
    changeconnection's quality profile).</p>"
