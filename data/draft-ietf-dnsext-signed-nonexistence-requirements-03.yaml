abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC-bis uses the NSEC record to provide authenticated denial of
    existence of RRsets. NSEC also has the side-effect of permitting zone enumeration,
    even if zone transfers have been forbidden. Because some see this as a problem,
    this document has been assembled to detail the possible requirements for denial
    of existence A/K/A signed proof of non-existence.</p>"
