abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way\n
    \  Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance\n   monitoring
    in IP networks. Delay measurement is performed in these\n   protocols by using
    timestamped test packets. Some implementations use\n   hardware-based timestamping
    engines that integrate the accurate\n   transmission timestamp into every outgoing
    OWAMP/TWAMP test packet\n   during transmission.  Since these packets are transported
    over UDP,\n   the UDP checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification.\n
    \  This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet\n   as
    a Checksum Trailer, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the\n   checksum
    modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP\n   checksum field. The
    behavior defined in this document is completely\n   interoperable with existing
    OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
