abstract:
- content: "<p>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-, service-
    and subscriber-related operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an
    Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)). The
    main goal of this protocol is to configure and manage access equipments and allow
    them to report information to the NAS in order to enable and optimize configuration.
    This document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter,
    developing a threat model for ANCP security aiming to decide which security functions
    are required at the ANCP level. Based on this, security requirements regarding
    the Access Node Control Protocol are defined.</p>"
