abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks, the
    signalling\n   path between a calling user and a called user can be partioned
    into\n   segments, referred to as traffic legs.  Each traffic leg may span\n   networks
    belonging to different operators, and will have its own\n   characteristics that
    can be different from other traffic legs in the\n   same call.  The directionality
    in traffic legs relates to a SIP\n   request creating a dialogue and stand-alone
    SIP request.  A traffic\n   leg might be associated with multiple SIP dialogs,
    e.g. in case a\n   B2BUA which modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within
    the\n   traffic leg.\n\n   This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl'.
    \ The parameter\n   can be used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated
    with\n   the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the\n   address,
    represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple\n   traffic legs).\n\n
    \  The SIP URI 'iotl' parameter defined in this document is only\n   applicable
    to 3GPP networks.  The usage of the parameter within other\n   types of networks
    is undefined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
