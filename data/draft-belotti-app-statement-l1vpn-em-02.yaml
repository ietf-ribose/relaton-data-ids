abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability statement on the use of Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to satisfy the
    requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. L1VPNs
    provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The
    operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where
    the Enhanced Mode of operation may also include exchange of routing information
    between the layer 1 network and the customer domain.</p>"
