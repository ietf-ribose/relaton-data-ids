abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,
    to\n   enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy\n
    \  multicast support, and enable a large degree of scalability by\n   splitting
    the broadcast domains.  A broadcast-efficient backbone\n   running classical IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery federates multiple wireless\n   links to form a large MultiLink
    Subnet, but the broadcast domain does\n   not need to extend to the wireless links
    for the purpose of ND\n   operation.  Backbone Routers placed at the wireless
    edge of the\n   backbone proxy the ND operation and route packets from/to registered\n
    \  nodes, and wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered to the\n   Backbone
    Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that is\n   essentially similar to
    a classical Layer-2 association.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
