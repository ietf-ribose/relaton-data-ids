abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global\n
    \  authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those\n   resources.  Network
    operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate
    BGP route origination\n   assertions.  ISPs can also be able to use the RPKI to
    validate the\n   path of a BGP route.  However, ISPs may want to establish a local\n
    \  view of the RPKI to control its own network while making use of RPKI\n   data.
    \ The mechanisms described in this document provide a simple way\n   to enable
    INR holders to establish a local, customized view of the\n   RPKI, overriding
    global RPKI repository data as needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
