abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Currently, HTML forms allow the producer of the form to request
    \ninformation, including files of data, from the operator using the \nform. However,
    this capability is limited because HTML forms don't \nprovide a way to ask the
    operator to submit input from arbitrary \nsources such as audio devices like microphones.
    Since input and \nupload from various devices is a feature that will benefit many
    \napplications, this draft proposes an extension to the HTML INPUT \ntype='file'
    form element. Motivations include language instruction \nassistance, voice transcription,
    and high-quality speech \ntransmission under low-bandwidth conditions.\n\t </p>\n
