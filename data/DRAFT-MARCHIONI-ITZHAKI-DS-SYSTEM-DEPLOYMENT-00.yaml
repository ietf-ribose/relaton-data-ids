abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Most digital-signature system deployments require dedicated and
    \nsolution-specific user-enrollment procedures and user-enrollment \nsoftware[1],
    and mandate provisioning and distribution of physical or \nsoftware-based signature-key
    tokens to end users.  As deployed such \napproaches create a high burden in logistics,
    cost, and help-desk \nsupport.  They also introduce training obstacles for users
    and \nsystems administrators.\n\nThis document describes the deployment architecture
    approach used by \nARX to provide secure and efficient digital signature services
    based \non its CoSign(r) solution.  The security solution's deployment \narchitecture
    is documented in the hope that other digital-signature \nand PKI deployment efforts
    will deliver comparable efficiencies.\n\n\n[1] This is also true for deployments
    of non-standard proprietary \n\n electronic signature solutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
