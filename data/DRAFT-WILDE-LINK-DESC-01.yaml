abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links,
    and\n   these links often define certain expectations about the interactions\n
    \  (such as HTTP methods being allowed, media types being accepted in\n   the
    request, or URI templates being supported).  While these\n   expectations are
    essential to define the possible interactions, it\n   may be useful to further
    narrow them down by providing link\n   descriptions, which can help clients to
    gain more runtime knowledge\n   about the resource they are about to interact
    with.  This memo\n   defines Link Descriptions, a model and associated media type
    that can\n   be used to describe links by supporting descriptive markup for\n
    \  representing interaction information with links.  Link Descriptions\n   can
    be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek\n   to make Link
    Descriptions runtime-capable, without having to create\n   their own representation
    for them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
