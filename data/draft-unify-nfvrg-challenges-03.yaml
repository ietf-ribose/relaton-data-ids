abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of network and service functionality virtualization
    in carrier-grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility,
    efficiency, and manageability. In current practice, virtualization is controlled
    through orchestrator entities that expose programmable interfaces according to
    the underlying resource types. Typically this means the adoption of, on the one
    hand, established data center compute/storage and, on the other, network control
    APIs which were originally developed in isolation. Arguably, the possibility for
    innovation highly depends on the capabilities and openness of the aforementioned
    interfaces. This document introduces in simple terms the problems arising when
    one follows this approach and motivates the need for a high level of programmability
    beyond policy and service descriptions. This document also summarizes the challenges
    related to orchestration programming in this unified cloud and carrier network
    production environment. A subsequent problem is the resource orchestration. This
    is handled separately in [I-D.caszpe-nfvrg-orchestration-challenges] and will
    be merged in the next iteration of this document.</p>"
