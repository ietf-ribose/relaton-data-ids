abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a socket API for the multihoming shim
    layer.\n   The API aims to enable interactions between the applications and the\n
    \  multihoming shim layer for advanced locator management and also for\n   accessing
    to information about failure detection and path\n   exploration.\n\n   This document
    is based on an assumption that a multhomed host is\n   equipped with a 'shim'
    layer which essentially maintains mappings\n   between identifiers and locators
    at the IP layer.  SHIM6 and HIP are\n   examples of this shim layer.  Hence, the
    API can be commonly used by\n   SHIM6 and HIP.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
