abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad hocnetworks
    (MANETs). The protocol---termed Differential DestinationMulticast (DDM)---differs
    from common approaches proposed for ad hocmulticast routing in two ways. Firstly,
    instead of distributingmembership control throughout the network, DDM concentrates
    thisauthority at the data sources (i.e. senders) thereby giving sendersknowledge
    of group membership. Secondly, differentially-encoded,variable-length destination
    headers are inserted in data packetswhich are used in combination with unicast
    routing tables to forwardmulticast packets towards multicast receivers. Instead
    of requiringthat multicast forwarding state be stored in participating nodes,this
    approach also provides the option of stateless multicasting.Each node independently
    has the choice of maintaining cachedforwarding state, or requesting its upstream
    neighbor to insert thisstate into self-routed data packets, or some combination
    thereof.The protocol is best suited for use with small multicast groupsoperating
    in dynamic networks of any size.</p>"
