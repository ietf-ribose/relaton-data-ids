abstract:
- content: <p>While DNS highly depends on cache, its cache usage of non-existence
    information was limited to exact matching. This draft proposes the aggressive
    use of a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to express non-existence of
    range of names authoritatively. With this proposal, shorter latency to many of
    negative responses is expected as well as some level of mitigation of random sub-domain
    attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks). It is also expected that non-existent
    TLD queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.</p>
