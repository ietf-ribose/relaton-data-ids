abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP/2 defines the wire mechanics of Server Push.  Though the\n
    \  mechanics of how a pushed resource is delivered are well-specified,\n   the
    use cases that describe which resources can be pushed, in what\n   states, and
    for what purpose are not described in HTTP/2.  As a\n   result, support between
    implementations varies widely.\n\n   This document attempts to enumerate interesting
    scenarios, in hopes\n   that a more concrete taxonomy can assist the community
    in arriving at\n   a standard set of supported scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
