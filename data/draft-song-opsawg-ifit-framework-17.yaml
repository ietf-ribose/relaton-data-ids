abstract:
- content: "<p>As network scale increases and network operation becomes more sophisticated,
    existing Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) methods are no longer
    sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements. Emerging data-plane
    on-path telemetry techniques which provide high-precision flow insight and which
    issue notifications in real time can supplement existing proactive and reactive
    methods that run in active and passive modes. These new approaches are collectively
    known as in-situ flow information telemetry (IFIT). They enable quality of experience
    for users and applications, and identification of network faults and deficiencies.
    This document outlines a high-level framework for IFIT to collect and correlate
    performance measurement information from the network. It identifies the components
    that coordinate existing protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses
    deployment challenges for flow- oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially
    in carrier networks. The document is a guide for system designers applying the
    referenced techniques. It is also intended to motivate further work to enhance
    the OAM ecosystem.</p>"
