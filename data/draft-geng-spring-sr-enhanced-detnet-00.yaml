abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency
    for critical flows. This document defines how to leverage Segment Routing(SR)
    and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) to implement bounded latency. Specifically,
    new SRv6 SID function is used to specify bounded latency information for a packet.
    When forwarding devices along the path follow the instructions carried in the
    packet, the bounded latency is achieved by different implementations based on
    bounded latency information.</p>"
