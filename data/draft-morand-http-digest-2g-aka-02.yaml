abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based on Global System for
    Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and key generation functions A3 and
    A8, also known as GSM AKA or 2G AKA. The HTTP Authentication Framework includes
    two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest. Both schemes employ a shared secret
    based mechanism for access authentication. The GSM AKA mechanism performs user
    authentication and session key distribution in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) networks. GSM AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that uses
    symmetric cryptography.</p>"
