abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked\n
    \  flexibility, and required long planning times when deploying new\n   services.
    Network Providers and Service Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow
    separation of data plane and control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path
    setup and protection, and centralized\n   path computation for service planning
    and traffic engineering.\n   Although these technologies provide significant benefits,
    they do\n   not meet the growing need for network programmability, automation,\n
    \  resource sharing, and service elasticity necessary for meeting\n   customer
    demands and evolving Internet applications\n\n   By combining the aforementioned
    capabilities with network resource\n   virtualization and abstraction mechanisms,
    available via well-\n   defined customer interfaces, providing significant operational\n
    \  benefits to meet the growing demands from customers and\n   applications. The
    work effort investigating this problem space is\n   known as Abstraction and Control
    of Transport Networks (ACTN).\n\n   This document provides an ACTN problem description,
    scope of work,\n   and outlines the core requirements to facilitate network resource\n
    \  virtualization and resource slicing for customers and applications,\n   across
    Service Provider and Network Provider transport network\n   infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\t
