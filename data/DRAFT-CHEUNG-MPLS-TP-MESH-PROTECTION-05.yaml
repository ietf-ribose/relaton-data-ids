abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to address the requirement
    to\n   support protection of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in an MPLS\n   Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) mesh topology.  The shared mesh\n   protection mechanism enables
    multiple protection paths within a\n   shared mesh protection domain to share
    protection resources for the\n   protection of working paths by coordinating protection
    switching\n   operations according to the priority assigned to each end-to-end\n
    \  linear protection domain.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
