abstract:
  content: "<p>Rather than forcing the client to decide whether IPv4 or IPv6 is moreconvenient
    to reach a web server; this document proposes to let theweb server check whether
    there is IPv6 connectivity to the client;then the web server can do a HTTP redirect
    to the force the client touse IPv6.This is done easily by a script within the
    server HTML pages and doesnot require any change in the client applications or
    configuration.The client still can control whether he/she wants to enabled IPv6.This
    draft could be discussed on the Applications Discuss mailinglist, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.</p>"
