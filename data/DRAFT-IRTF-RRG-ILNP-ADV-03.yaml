abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an Architectural description and the\n
    \  Concept of Operations of some optional advanced deployment\n   scenarios for
    the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP),\n   which is an evolutionary enhancement
    to IP. None of the functions\n   described here is required for the use or deployment
    of ILNP.\n   Instead, it offers descriptions of engineering and deployment\n   options
    that might provide either enhanced capability or\n   convenience in administration
    or management of ILNP-based\n   systems.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
