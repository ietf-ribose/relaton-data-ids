abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>PKCS #12 v1.1 describes a transfer syntax for personal identity
    information, including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous secrets, and
    extensions. Machines, applications, browsers, Internet kiosks, and so on, that
    support this standard will allow a user to import, export, and exercise a single
    set of personal identity information. This standard supports direct transfer of
    personal information under several privacy and integrity modes.\n\n This document
    represents a republication of PKCS #12 v1.1 from RSA Laboratories' Public Key
    Cryptography Standard (PKCS) series. By publishing this RFC, change control is
    transferred to the IETF.\n\t </p>\n      "
