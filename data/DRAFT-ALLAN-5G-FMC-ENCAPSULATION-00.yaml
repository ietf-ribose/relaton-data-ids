abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As part of providing wireline access to the 5G core, deployed\n
    \  wireline networks carry user data between 5G residential gateways\n   and the
    5G Access Gateway Function (AGF). The encapsulation used\n   needs to meet a variety
    of requirements including being able to\n   multiplex the traffic of multiple
    PDU sessions within a VLAN\n   delineated access circuit, to permit legacy equipment
    in the data\n   path to snoop certain packet fields, to carry 5G QoS information\n
    \  associated with the data, and to be efficiently encoded. This memo\n   specifies
    an encapsulation that meets these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
