abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are many issues concerning the deployment and implementation,and
    to a lesser degree, specification of IPv6 multicast. This memodescribes known
    problems, trying to raise awareness. Currently,global IPv6 interdomain multicast
    is completely impossible exceptusing SSM: there is no way to convey information
    about multicastsources between PIM RPs. Site-scoped multicast is also problematicwhen
    used alongside to global multicast because of that. A fewpossible solutions are
    outlined or referred to. In addition, anissue regarding link-local multicast-blocking
    Ethernet switches isbrought up. Finally, a feature request for MLD snooping switches
    isnoted.</p>"
