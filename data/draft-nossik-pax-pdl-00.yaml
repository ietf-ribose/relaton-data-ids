abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes PAX Pattern Description Language (PDL). PAX
    is aspecial purpose language for definitions of filters (recognizers) forsequential
    inputs. The language is suitable for describing patternmatching criteria in policy-based
    networking devices such as QoS routersand switches, packet filters, RMON probes,
    traffic shapers, etc. It pro-vides consistent means of programming policy-based
    networking devicesbased on different hardware and software platforms. Programs
    written inPAX can be built incrementally, where elementary patterns can be used
    asbuilding blocks for more complex ones. The language encourages modularand object-oriented
    design.</p>"
