abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft discusses the motivation for MPLS OAM functionality
    and\npossible requirements for OAM in MPLS networks. Examples of OAM\nfunctions
    include support for fault management, continuity checks,\nloopbacks, performance
    monitoring and protection switching. Such\ncapabilities may be useful in many
    applications of MPLS networks, but\na detailed set of requirements is currently
    not available. Further\ndiscussion and input is solicited, in particular from
    network\noperators and service providers.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
