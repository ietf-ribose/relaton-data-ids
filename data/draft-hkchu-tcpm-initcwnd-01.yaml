abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes an increase in the permitted TCP initialwindow
    (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390,to 10 segments. It
    discusses the motivation behind the increase, theadvantages and disadvantages
    of the higher initial window, andpresents results from several large scale experiments
    showing thatthe higher initial window improves the overall performance of manyweb
    services without risking congestion collapse. Finally, itoutlines a list of concerns
    to be addressed in future tests.</p>"
