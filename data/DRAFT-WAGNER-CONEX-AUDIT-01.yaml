abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders
    inform\n   the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on\n
    \  the same flow.  Reliable auditing is necessary to provide a strong\n   incentive
    to declare ConEx information honestly.  This document\n   defines how the signals
    are handled by an audit and lists\n   requirements for an audit implementation.
    \ This document does not\n   mandate a particular design but identifies state
    and functions that\n   any auditor element must provide to fullfil the requirements
    stated\n   in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
