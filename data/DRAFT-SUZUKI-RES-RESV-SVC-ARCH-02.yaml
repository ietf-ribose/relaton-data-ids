abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of this document is to clarify the architecture that\n
    \  should be used for the resource reservation service for the\n   commercial
    Internet.\n \n   First, this document explains the basis of the tariff for current\n
    \  telecommunication and Internet services.  Then it clarifies problems\n   in
    the billing for Internet service, and describes how billing can be\n   improved
    by using the resource reservation setup protocol.  Finally,\n   it also studies
    technical and application models for a commercial\n   resource reservation service
    model, and clarifies an architecture for\n   the resource reservation setup protocol.\n\t
