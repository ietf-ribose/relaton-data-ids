abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support netgroup and netservice databases.
    A netgroup database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information
    Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with
    the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. A netgroup database represents
    groups of hosts, users and domains. A netservice database schema is a new extension
    to netgroups that allows administrators to describe services or configuration
    options for a user or system based upon their netgroup membership. This document
    describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis- mapping-00] for netgroup and
    netservice databases, and database entries referenced by those maps.</p>"
