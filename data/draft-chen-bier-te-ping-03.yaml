abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet
    formats with BIER as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]. BIER-TE forwards
    and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition
    of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies. This document
    describes the mechanism and basic BIER-TE OAM packet format that can be used to
    perform Ping and Traceroute on BIER-TE network.</p>"
