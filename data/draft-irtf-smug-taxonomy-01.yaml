abstract:
  content: "<p>With the growth and commercialization of the Internet, the need forsecure
    IP multicast is growing. In this draft we present a taxonomy of multicast security
    issues. We first sketch some multicast groupparameters that are relevant to security,
    and outline the basicsecurity issues concerning multicast in general, with emphasis
    on IPmulticast. Next we suggest two 'benchmark' scenarios for securemulticast
    solutions. Lastly we review some previous works.</p>"
