abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical\n
    \  Signature System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based\n   signature
    algorithm with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption\n   (COSE) syntax.  The
    HSS/LMS algorithm is one form of hash-based\n   digital signature; it is described
    in RFC 8554.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
