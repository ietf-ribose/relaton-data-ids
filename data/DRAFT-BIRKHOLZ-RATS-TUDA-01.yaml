abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This documents defines the method and bindings used to conduct
    Time-\n   based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) between two RATS (Remote\n
    \  ATtestation procedureS) Principals over the Internet.  TUDA does not\n   require
    a challenge-response handshake and thereby does not rely on\n   the conveyance
    of a nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation\n   Evidence.  Conversely,
    TUDA enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs\n   that can constitute Evidence
    about current and past operational\n   states of an Attester.  As a prerequisite
    for TUDA, every RATS\n   Principal requires access to a trusted and synchronized
    time-source.\n   Per default, in TUDA this is a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) issuing\n
    \  signed Time Stamp Tokens (TST).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
