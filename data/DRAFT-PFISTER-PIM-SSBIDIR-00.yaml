abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document adds Source-Specific capabilities to the Bidirectional\n
    \  Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM-BIDIR) routing protocol.\n   Similarly
    to PIM-BIDIR, multicast traffic is always forwarded to the\n   RP Link, but packets
    are also filtered based on their source address\n   and source-specific subscription
    state.  This operation mode is\n   backwards compatible with PIM-BIDIR, provides
    a simpler alternative\n   to PIM-SM and does not suffer when the multicast source
    location\n   cannot be determined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
