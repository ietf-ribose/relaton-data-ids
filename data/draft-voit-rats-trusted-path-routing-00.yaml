abstract:
- content: "<p>There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like IPSec
    alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly sensitive
    traffic flows. This specification describes two alternatives for protecting these
    sensitive flows as they transit a network. In both alternatives, protection is
    accomplished by forwarding sensitive flows across network devices currently appraised
    as trustworthy.</p>"
