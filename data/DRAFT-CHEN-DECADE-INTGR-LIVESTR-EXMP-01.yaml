abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DECADE is an in-network storage infrastructure which is under\n
    \  discussions and constructions.  It can be integrated into Peer-to-\n   Peer
    (P2P) applications to achieve more efficient content\n   distributions.  This
    document represents two detailed examples of how\n   to integrate DECADE into
    P2P applications (live streaming and file\n   sharing).  Specifically, it describes
    mainly about: 1) a preliminary\n   DECADE client API; 2) a P2P live streaming
    integration with DECADE;\n   3) a P2P file sharing integration with DECADE; 4)
    tests on our DECADE\n   integrarions and 5) an application performance analysis
    from the\n   tests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
