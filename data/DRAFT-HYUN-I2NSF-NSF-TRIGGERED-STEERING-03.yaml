abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture of the I2NSF framework
    using\n   security function chaining for securiy policy enforcement.  Security\n
    \  function chaining enables composite inspection of network traffic by\n   steering
    the traffic through multiple types of network security\n   functions according
    to the information model for NSFs capabilities in\n   the I2NSF framework.  This
    document explains the additional\n   components integrated into the I2NSF framework
    and their\n   functionalities to achieve security function chaining.  It also\n
    \  describes representative use cases to address major benefits from the\n   proposed
    architecture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
