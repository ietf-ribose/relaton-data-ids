abstract:
- content: "<p>The FMIPv6 specification [1] allows mobile node sending packet using
    previous Care of Address (PCoA) at a new subnet. But such packets are ignored
    at home agent or correspondent node because the Binding Cache doesn't contain
    the PCoA anymore. To avoid this problem, we propose keeping old binding cache
    for a bit.</p>"
