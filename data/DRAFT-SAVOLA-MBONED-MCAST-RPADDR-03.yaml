abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As has been noticed, there is exists a huge deployment problem
    with\nglobal, interdomain IPv6 multicast: Protocol Independent Multicast -\nSparse
    Mode (PIM-SM) Rendezvous Points (RPs) have no way of\ncommunicating the information
    about multicast sources to other\nmulticast domains, as there is no Multicast
    Source Discovery Protocol\n(MSDP), and the whole interdomain Any Source Multicast
    model is\nrendered unusable; SSM avoids these problems.  This memo outlines a\nway
    to embed the address of the RP in the multicast address, solving\nthe interdomain
    multicast problem. The problem is three-fold: specify\nan address format, adjust
    the operational procedures and\nconfiguration if necessary, and modify PIM-SM
    implementations of\nthose who want to join or send to a group (Designated Routers)
    or\nprovide one (Rendezvous Points).  In consequence, there would be no\nneed
    for interdomain MSDP, and even intra-domain RP configuration\ncould be simplified.
    \ This memo updatres RFC 3306.\n\t </p>\n      "
