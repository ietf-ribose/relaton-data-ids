abstract:
  content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] describes a solution of carrying multicast traffic
    using replication ingress and inclusive trees (P2MP LSPs). It does not provide
    the usage of selective trees for carrying multicast traffic. This document provides
    protocols and procedures by which a selective tree can be used to carry traffic
    belonging only to a specified set of IP multicast streams from one or more EVPN
    instances.</p>"
