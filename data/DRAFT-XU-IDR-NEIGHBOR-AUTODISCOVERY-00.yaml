abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP has been used as an underlay routing protocol in many hyper-scale\n
    \  data centers.  This document proposes a BGP neighbor autodiscovery\n   mechanism
    which can be used to simplify the BGP deployment greatly.\n   This mechanism is
    very useful for those hyper-scale data centers\n   where BGP is used as an underlay
    routing protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
