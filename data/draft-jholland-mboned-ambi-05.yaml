abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Asymmetric Manifest-Based Integrity (AMBI). AMBI
    allows each receiver or forwarder of a stream of multicast packets to check the
    integrity of the contents of each packet in the data stream. AMBI operates by
    passing cryptographically verifiable hashes of the data packets inside manifest
    messages, and sending the manifests over authenticated out-of-band communication
    channels.</p>"
