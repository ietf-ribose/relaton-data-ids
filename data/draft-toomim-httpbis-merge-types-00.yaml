abstract:
- content: "<p>Merge Types specify how to merge multiple simultaneous edits to a resource.
    This happens when two computers edit the same state over a network with latency.
    A Merge Type specifies how to merge conflicting changes. If the computers implement
    and agree upon the same Merge Type, then they can guarantee to reach a consistent
    state, after arbitrary edits, eventually. You can define new Merge Types. This
    document defines Merge Types, the structure of the Merge Type system, and IANA
    registration procedures for Merge Types.</p>"
