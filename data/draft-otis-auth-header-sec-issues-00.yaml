abstract:
  content: "<p>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a headerfield
    used to capture email verification results of borderreceptions. These results
    are then conveyed to Mail User Agents(MUA) and downstream filters. This header
    field is to augmentfiltering decisions and message annotations that can be made
    visibleto recipients. The annotations could affirm originating domains orcontent
    integrity when based upon Domainkeys or DKIM results, or adomain's authorization
    of a publicly transmitting SMTP client IPaddress when based upon Sender-ID or
    SPF results, or that the SMTPclient IP address maps to a matching domain within
    the DNS reversenamespace.Although the draft acknowledges the conflation of authorization
    withauthentication in section 1.5.2, and explicitly declares Sender-IDand SPF
    as the authorization of the transmitting SMTP client, itstill fails to offer the
    authenticated entity being trusted in theexchange, the IP address of the SMTP
    client. An authenticated entityis essential for reputation assessments which section
    4.1 indicatesshould be made prior to results being revealed. A reputation checkis
    often a necessary step to mitigate abuse and fraud. Even so, theheader offers
    no assurance that any reputation check has been made,nor does it ensure that the
    trusted entity, the IP address of theSMTP client, can be determined by the MUA
    or downstream filter.</p>"
