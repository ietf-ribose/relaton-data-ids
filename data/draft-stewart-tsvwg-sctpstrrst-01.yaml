abstract:
  content: <p>Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the abilityto
    "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream is to startthe numbering
    sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with acorresponding notification to the
    upper layer that this act as beenperformed. The applications that have requested
    this featurenormally desire it so that they can "re-use" streams for differentpurposes
    but still utilize the stream sequence number for theapplication to track the message
    flows. Thus, without this feature,a new use on an old stream would result in message
    numbers largerthan expected without a protocol mechanism to "start the streams
    backat zero". This documents presents also a method for resetting thetransport
    sequence numbers and all stream sequence numbers.</p>
