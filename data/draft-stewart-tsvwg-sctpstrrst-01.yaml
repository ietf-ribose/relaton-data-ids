abstract:
- content: <p>Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the ability
    to "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream is to start the numbering
    sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the
    upper layer that this act as been performed. The applications that have requested
    this feature normally desire it so that they can "re-use" streams for different
    purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number for the application to track
    the message flows. Thus, without this feature, a new use on an old stream would
    result in message numbers larger than expected without a protocol mechanism to
    "start the streams back at zero". This documents presents also a method for resetting
    the transport sequence numbers and all stream sequence numbers.</p>
