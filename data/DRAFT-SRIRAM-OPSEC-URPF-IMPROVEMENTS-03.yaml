abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast\n
    \  Reverse Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) [BCP84] for source address\n   validation
    (SAV) [BCP38].  The strict uRPF is inflexible about\n   directionality, the loose
    uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and\n   the current feasible-path uRPF attempts
    to strike a balance between\n   the two [BCP84].  However, as shown in this draft,
    the existing\n   feasible-path uRPF still has short comings.  This document describes\n
    \  an enhanced feasible-path uRPF technique, which aims to be more\n   flexible
    (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the\n   feasible-path uRPF.  It
    can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns\n   about the possibility of disrupting
    service for their customers, and\n   encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
