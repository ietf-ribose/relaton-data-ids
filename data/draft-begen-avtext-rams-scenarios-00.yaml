abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution
    is amethod based on RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables anRTP receiver
    to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicastdata. Upon a request from
    the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTPretransmission session is set up between
    a retransmission server andthe RTP receiver, over which the reference information
    about the newmulticast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is transmitted
    atan accelerated rate. This often precedes, but may also accompany,the multicast
    stream itself. When there is only one multicast streamto be acquired, the RAMS
    solution works in a straightforward manner.However, when there are two or more
    multicast streams to be acquiredfrom the same or different multicast RTP sessions,
    care should betaken to configure each RAMS session appropriately. This documentprovides
    example scenarios and offers guidelines.</p>"
