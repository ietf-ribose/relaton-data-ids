abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed
    MPLS\nprotection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure.\nIt
    provides a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic\nloss (typically
    sub 50msec) if the node that detects the failure\nlocally, does the repair by
    re-routing the protected traffic to go\nover the backup tunnel. A direct application
    of this mechanism to a\nring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth
    that\ncould also result in degraded service. This document describes a\nmechanism
    to do it without such problems.\n\t </p>\n      "
