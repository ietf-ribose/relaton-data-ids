abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over LoRaWAN using
    6LowPAN techniques. LoRaWAN is a wireless communication system for long-range
    low-power low-data-rate applications. LoRaWAN networks typically are laid out
    in a star topology in the field with gateways relaying messages between end-devices
    and a central network server in the backend, the complete system referred to as
    star of stars network.</p>"
