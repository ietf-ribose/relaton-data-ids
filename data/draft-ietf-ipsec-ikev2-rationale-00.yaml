abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the reasons for the design choices in IKEv2,
    the protocol described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-01.txt. This document describes
    why certain features are supported, and explains the modifications between the
    second draft of IKEv2 and the first. It describes both the changes we chose to
    make and the changes that we considered but chose not to make. The changes are
    minor and mostly based on feedback received from the first draft.</p>"
