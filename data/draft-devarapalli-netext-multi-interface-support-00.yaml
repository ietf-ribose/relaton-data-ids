abstract:
  content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6mobile
    node with no mobility management protocol. It makes it appearto the mobile node
    that its IP address does not change as the mobilenode moves across the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domain. There have been someissues identified with supporting a host with
    multiple interfacesattaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. This document describesand
    analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this. It alsodescribes the requirements
    for a handover across interfaces usingProxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
