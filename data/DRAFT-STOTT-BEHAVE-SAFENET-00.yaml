abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the main challenges hindering the acceptance of VoIP
    is a \n   standards-based solution for traversing middleboxes such as Network
    \n   Address Translation (NAT) and FireWall (FW) boxes.  This Internet-\n   Draft
    presents SAFENeT, a protocol that is intended to operate in an \n   enterprise
    environment and that allows the accommodation of real-time \n   services by the
    call server, internal to the enterprise network, to \n   communicate with the
    NAT/FW to enable the transversal of real-time \n   services including VoIP.  This
    document describes the SAFENeT \n   architecture and protocol and shows how it
    overcomes the problems \n   caused by NATs/FWs.  The SAFENeT architecture also
    enables security \n   features such as data confidentiality and digital integrity
    to be \n   used for the VoIP traffic traversing the NAT/FW.  \n\t </p>\n      "
