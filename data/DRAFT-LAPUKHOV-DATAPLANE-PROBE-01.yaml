abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has\n
    \  traditionally been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see\n   [RFC7276])
    or more complex systems built on similar concepts of\n   active probing and path
    tracing.  While using active synthetic probes\n   is proven to be helpful in detecting
    data-plane faults, isolating\n   fault location is a much harder problem, especially
    in diverse\n   networks with multiple active forwarding planes (e.g.  IP and MPLS).\n
    \  Moreover, existing end-to-end tools do not generally support\n   functionality
    beyond dealing with packet loss - for example, they are\n   hardly useful for
    detecting and reporting transient (i.e. milli- or\n   even micro-second) network
    congestion.\n\n   Modern network forwarding hardware can allow for more sophisticated\n
    \  data-plane functionality that provides substantial improvement to the\n   isolation
    and identification capabilities of network elements.  For\n   example, it has
    become possible to encode a snapshot of a network\n   element's state within the
    packet payload as it transits the device.\n   One example of such state would
    be queue depth on the egress port\n   taken by that specific packet.  When combined
    with a unique device\n   identifier embedded in the same packet, this could allow
    for precise\n   time and topological identification of the the congested location\n
    \  within the network.\n\n   This document proposes a format for requesting and
    embedding\n   telemetry information in active probes, i.e. packet designated for\n
    \  actively testing the network while not carrying application traffic.\n   These
    active probes could be conveyed over multiple protocols (ICMP,\n   UDP, TCP, etc.)
    and the document does not prescribe any particular\n   transport.  In addition,
    this document provides recommendations on\n   handling the active probes by devices
    that do not support the\n   required data-plane functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
