abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several\n   hosts
    from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired\n   resource.  ALTO is
    realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\n   ALTO client can ask for guidance
    it needs to discover one or more\n   ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.\n\n
    \  In some deployment scenarios, in particular if the information about\n   the
    network topology is partitioned and distributed over several ALTO\n   servers,
    it may be needed to discover an ALTO server outside of the\n   own network domain,
    in order to get appropriate guidance.  This\n   document details applicable scenarios,
    itemizes requirements, and\n   specifies a procedure for ALTO cross-domain server
    discovery.\n\n   Technically, the algorithm specified in this document takes one\n
    \  IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (i.e., \"ALTO:\n   http\"
    or \"ALTO:https\") as parameters.  It performs DNS lookups (for\n   NAPTR resource
    records in the in-addr.arpa. or ip6.arpa. tree) and\n   returns one or more URI(s)
    of information resources related to that\n   IP address or prefix.\n\n\t </p>\n
