abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures for using Resource Reservation\n
    \  Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for signaling Pseudowires\n   (PWs).
    One motivation is the signaling of PW QoS. The other is the\n   setup of a multi-hop
    PW, for example, to span multiple domains.\n   RSVP-TE provides mechanisms for
    QoS signaling and these can be\n   leveraged for signaling PW QoS. It also provides
    the ability to\n   signal bi-directional MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP) with
    explicit\n   routes. This can be used for signaling multi-hop PWs that require\n
    \  explicit routing. RSVP-TE also provides the ability to establish non-\n   adjacent
    or targeted signaling sessions.\n\t </p>\n      "
