abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to\ndisseminate
    routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information\nwithin a routing domain.
    \ Given the effectiveness of these\nmechanisms, it is convenient to envision using
    the same mechanism for\ndissemination of other types of information within the
    domain.\nHowever, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact\nintra-domain
    routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the\nstability of the OSPF routing
    domain.  This document presents\nmechanism to relegate this ancillary information
    to a separate OSPF\ninstance and minimize the impact.\n\t </p>\n      "
