abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies Hello extensions to Transport Layer Security
    (TLS). One extension is used for carrying application data which is suitable for
    delayed integrity protection and does not require privacy protection. Another
    extension is used to negotiate an early start to the application data protocol
    in the case of initial TLS connections (i.e., which do not resume sessions). We
    describe how to use these extensions to reduce the number of round trips needed
    for application-layer authentication, by piggy-backing Simple Authentication (SASL)
    mechanism negotiation on the first leg of a TLS handshake and the first round
    of SASL authentication messages on the second leg of the same TLS handshake. Through
    SASL we get support for Generic Security Services (GSS-API) mechanisms. Channel
    binding is used from SASL authentication to the TLS channel. This results in a
    two round-trip optimization for applications that use SASL on top of TLS. We also
    provide generic framing for SASL authentication messages which, combined with
    the use of these extensions, will be referred to as "TLS/SA". These extensions
    can also be used to optimize application protocols separately from SASL.</p>
