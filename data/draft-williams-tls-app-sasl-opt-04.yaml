abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies Hello extensions to Transport Layer Security(TLS).
    One extension is used for carrying application data which issuitable for delayed
    integrity protection and does not requireprivacy protection. Another extension
    is used to negotiate an earlystart to the application data protocol in the case
    of initial TLSconnections (i.e., which do not resume sessions).We describe how
    to use these extensions to reduce the number of roundtrips needed for application-layer
    authentication, by piggy-backingSimple Authentication (SASL) mechanism negotiation
    on the first legof a TLS handshake and the first round of SASL authenticationmessages
    on the second leg of the same TLS handshake. Through SASLwe get support for Generic
    Security Services (GSS-API) mechanisms.Channel binding is used from SASL authentication
    to the TLS channel.This results in a two round-trip optimization for applications
    thatuse SASL on top of TLS.We also provide generic framing for SASL authentication
    messageswhich, combined with the use of these extensions, will be referred toas
    \"TLS/SA\". These extensions can also be used to optimizeapplication protocols
    separately from SASL.</p>"
