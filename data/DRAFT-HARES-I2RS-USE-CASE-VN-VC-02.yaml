abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software Defined Networks (SDN) provides a way to virtualize
    and\n   abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to\n
    \  third-party applications running in software.  Applications can\n   utilize
    a programmable interface to receive these virtual or abstract\n   resources descriptions
    in a form that allows monitoring or\n   manipulation of resources within the network.
    \ The Interface to the\n   Routing System (I2RS) provides an interface directly
    to the routing\n   System to monitor best paths to any destination or change routes
    in\n   the routing information base (RIB) or MPLS Label Information Base\n   (LIB).
    \ The I2RS interfaces may be combined with other interfaces to\n   the forwarding
    plane (ForCES (RFC3746)), device configuration\n   (NETCONF), or mid-level/peer-to-peer
    (ALTO, draft-ietf-alto-protocol)\n   system to create these virtual pathways.\n\n
    \  This document outlines how SDN networks can use the I2RS interface to\n   implement
    an automated set of network services for the Virtual\n   Connection on Demand
    (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD).\n   These systems provide service
    routing a better way to create paths\n   within a hub and spoke environment, and
    provide service routing the\n   ability to create pathways based on service.\n\n\t
