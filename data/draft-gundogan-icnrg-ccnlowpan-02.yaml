abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a convergence layer for CCNx and NDN over IEEE 802.15.4
    LoWPAN networks is defined. A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and
    NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic
    changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility
    with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching
    scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx
    and NDN. Additionally, the link fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching
    framework is applied to ICN chunks. Basic improvements in efficiency are advised
    by stateless and stateful compression schemes.</p>"
