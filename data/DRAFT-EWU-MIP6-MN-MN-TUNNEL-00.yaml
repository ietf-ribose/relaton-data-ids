abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IPv6 provides mobility support for mobile devices moving\n
    \  around the Internet.  It specifies that when a mobile host wishes for\n   peers
    to communicate directly to its visited location, that the peer\n   send packets
    using a Routing Header, Type 2.  Corresponding packets\n   from the mobile use
    a Home Address option.\n\n   When two moving devices communicate, they may wish
    to use a the most\n   direct data path between their respective locations.  Use
    of this\n   direct data path incurs the cost of both Routing Header and Home\n
    \  Address Options, in each direction.  This document provides a simple\n   means
    of reducing this overhead.\n\t </p>\n      "
