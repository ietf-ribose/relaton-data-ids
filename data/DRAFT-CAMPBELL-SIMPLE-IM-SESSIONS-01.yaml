abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The SIP MESSAGE method is used to send instant messages, where
    each\nmessage is independent of any other message. This is often called\npager-mode
    messaging, due to the fact that this model is similar to\nthat of most two-way
    pager devices. Another model is called\nsession-mode. In session-mode, the instant
    messages are part of a\nmedia session that provides ordering, a security context,
    and other\nfunctions. This media session is established using a SIP INVITE, just\nas
    an audio or video session would be established.\nThis document describes a The
    Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP),\na mechanism for transmitting session-mode
    messages with minimal relay\nsupport. Additionally, this document describes using
    the SDP offer/\nanswer model to initiate such sessions.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
