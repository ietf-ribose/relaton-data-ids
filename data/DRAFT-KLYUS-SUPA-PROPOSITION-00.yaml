abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rapid increase in enterprise and service provider network\n
    \  architecture complexity makes operating and managing services\n   much more
    difficult. Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions\n   (SUPA) defines a generic
    policy information model, and\n   associated generic YANG data models, for different
    types of\n   policy rules that control managed entities throughout the\n   service
    development and deployment lifecycle. It also defines a\n   mapping by which the
    management and monitoring of network\n   services can be done using standardized
    policy rules.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
