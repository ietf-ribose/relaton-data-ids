abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how DSR [1] can be applied in the vehicular\n
    \  ad hoc network (VANET) environment. Since DSR uses the source routing\n   mechanism,
    it can be appropriate for the VANET routing mechanisms\n   operating based on
    the source routing. Therefore, in this draft,\n   we describe how we can modify
    DSR for the VANET source routing.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
