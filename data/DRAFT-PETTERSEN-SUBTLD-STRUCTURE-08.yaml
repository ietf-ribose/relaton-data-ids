abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the term \"Public Suffix\" as meaning
    a domain\n   under which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the owner
    may\n   register subdomains.  Examples of Public Suffixes include \"org\",\n   \"co.uk\"
    and \"k12.wa.us\".  It also defines a fileformat that can be\n   used to distribute
    information about such Public Suffixes to relying\n   parties.  As an example,
    this information is then used to limit which\n   domains an Internet service can
    set cookies for, strengthening the\n   rules already defined by the cookie specifications.
    \ This\n   specification updates RFC 6265 [RFC6265] by defining the term \"Public\n
    \  Suffix\".\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
