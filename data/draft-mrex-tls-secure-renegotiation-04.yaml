abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves
    allcurrently implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2)vulnerable
    to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where the attacker canestablish a TLS session
    with a server, send crafted application dataof his choice to the server and then
    proxy an unsuspecting client'sTLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation handshake
    of the server. Many applications on top of TLS see the data injected by the attackerand
    the data sent by the client as a single data stream and assumethat an authentication
    during the TLS renegotiation handshake orcontained in the client's application
    data applies to the entire datastream received through the TLS-protected communication
    channel.This document describes a protocol change for all protocol versionsof
    TLS and SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability for allcommunication between updated
    TLS clients and updated TLS servers.</p>"
