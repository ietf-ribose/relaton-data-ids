abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay-
    and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using
    datagrams. It covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as
    well as the transportation of segments using the Licklider Transmission Protocol
    (LTP) (RFC 5326). UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are
    the candidate datagram protocols discussed. UDP can only be used on a local network
    or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control. DCCP addresses
    the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.
    This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG)
    and represents the consensus of the DTNRG.</p>"
