abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to enable ID and Locator namespace
    split in the CCN protocol that has several applications such as towards Interest
    routing optimization, seamless mobility and providing mobility as a service, conversational
    session support, handling indirections in manifests, and routing scalability.
    We enable this through the notion of a forwarding-label object (FLO), which is
    an optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest message with a topological name,
    which identifies a network domain, a router or a host. FLO can be inserted within
    the Interest message by the applications or by the network. FLO can be interpreted
    by the network in multiple ways, for instance, to terminate the message or to
    swap it with a new FLO based on the service context. Furthermore, depending on
    the application and trust context, FLO can be subjected to policy based actions
    by the forwarders, such as invoking security verification or enabling other service-centric
    FLO management actions.</p>"
