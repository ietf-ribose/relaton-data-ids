abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 transition has been an ongoing process throughout
    the world\n   due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space.  However, this\n
    \  transition leads to costly end-to-end network upgrades and poses new\n   challenges
    of managing a large number of devices with a variety of\n   transitioning protocols.
    \ While IPv6 transition tools exist, there\n   are still new issues exist.  Operators
    may need various types of IPv6\n   transition technologies depending on performance
    requirements,\n   deployment scenarios, etc.\n\n   To address these difficulties,
    a unifying approach would provide a\n   unified way to deploy IPv6 in a cost-effective,
    flexible manner.\n\n   This document describes issues for deploying multiple transition\n
    \  technologies during the whole IPv6 transition period.  It also\n   discusses
    potential technical gaps to achieve this work.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
