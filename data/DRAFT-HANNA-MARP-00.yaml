abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Multicast Address Request Protocol (MARP) serves as a front
    end\n   to the Multicast Address Allocation Architecture. Any host that\n   wishes
    to allocate a multicast address may contact a Multicast\n   Address Allocation
    Server and use MARP to request an address\n   allocation for a specific interval,
    scope, etc. Later, the host may\n   request an extension of the address allocation
    or deallocate the\n   address if it is no longer needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
