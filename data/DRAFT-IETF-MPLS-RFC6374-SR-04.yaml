abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ RFC 6374\n   specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate\n
    \  measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as\n   related
    metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks.  This\n   document utilizes
    these mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss\n   Measurements in SR networks
    with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both\n   SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS
    paths including Policies.  In\n   addition, this document defines Return Path
    TLV and Block Number TLV\n   extensions for RFC 6374.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
