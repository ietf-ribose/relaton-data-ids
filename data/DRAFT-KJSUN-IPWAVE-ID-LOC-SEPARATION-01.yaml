abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable
    routing,\n   enhancing mobility and privacy in IP based internet infrastructure.\n
    \  When we consider IP based vehicular networks, ID/Location separation\n   architecture
    is expected to offer benefits.  In this draft, we\n   analyze whether ID/Location
    separation protocols can adjust into IP\n   based vehicular networks and solve
    requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
