abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dynamically provisionable optical crossconnects (OXCs) will play
    an \nactive role in future optical networks and the MPL(ambda)S control \nplane
    will be used to establish, teardown, and reroute optical \ntrails through the
    network.  This document specifies extensions to \nRSVP to address some of the
    unique requirements of such optical \ntrails.  Specifically, we propose extensions
    to RSVP that allow an \nupstream node to make a Label suggestion to a downstream
    node when \nestablishing an optical trail and allow both directions of a bi-\ndirectional
    optical trail to be established simultaneously.  A new \nmessage type is also
    defined so that an RSVP node can notify \n(possibly non-adjacent) RSVP nodes when
    network failures occur, \nwithout affecting the RSVP states of intermediate RSVP
    nodes.  \nFinally, we propose a modification to allow bundle messages to be \nsent
    to non-adjacent RSVP nodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
