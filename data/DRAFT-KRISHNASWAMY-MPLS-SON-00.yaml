abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The advent of switched multi-channel (WDM) optical networks using\nOXCs
    (Optical Cross-connects) presents many new opportunities for\nsupporting faster
    and more flexible provision of IP services.  Key to\nrealizing such opportunities
    is providing the ability to\nautomatically set-up and tear-down paths (optical
    channels) across\nthe optical network, and provide means for IP services to leverage\nthis
    capability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish supporting\nprotocols and
    mechanisms. In this draft we study the requirements and\nmechanisms for optical
    network topology discovery, signaling path\nsetup, data path computation, and
    optical channel set-up. We leverage\nMPLS and other IP based protocols as a basis
    for achieving the above\nobjectives.\n\t </p>\n      "
