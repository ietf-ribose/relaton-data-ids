abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many standards track documents conditional words are used
    to\n   signify the requirements in the specification. These words are\n   prefered
    to be capitalized. This document defines these conditional\n   words as they should
    be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who\n   follow these guidelines should
    incorporate this phrase near the\n   beginning of their document. The additional
    key words to words\n   described in RFC2119 are; \"IF, THEN\", \"ELSE IF\", \"ELSE\".\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
