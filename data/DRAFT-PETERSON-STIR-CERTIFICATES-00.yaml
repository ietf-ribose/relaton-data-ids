abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to provide a means of proving ownership of telephone
    numbers\n   on the Internet, some kind of public structure needs to exist that\n
    \  binds cryptographic keys to authority over telephone numbers.  This\n   document
    describes a certificate-based credential system for\n   telephone numbers, which
    could be used as a part of a broader\n   architecture for managing telephone numbers
    as identities in\n   protocols like SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
