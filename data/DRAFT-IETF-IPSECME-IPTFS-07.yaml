abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to enhance IPsec traffic
    flow\n   security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) to\n   encrypted
    IP encapsulated traffic.  TFC is provided by obscuring the\n   size and frequency
    of IP traffic using a fixed-sized, constant-send-\n   rate IPsec tunnel.  The
    solution allows for congestion control as\n   well as non-constant send-rate usage.
    \ The mechanisms defined in this\n   document are generic with the intent of allowing
    for non-TFS uses,\n   but such uses are outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
