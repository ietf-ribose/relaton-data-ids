abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is a working document intended to trigger discussion and
    develop\n   draft text for the CoAP protocol specification in the area of group\n
    \  communication.  Engineering tradeoffs become more challenging in\n   constrained
    environments, therefore group communication is considered\n   within the context
    of adjacent topics that may impact or be impacted\n   by design choices in the
    subject area.  A solution based on IP\n   multicast is proposed.\n\n\t </p>\n
