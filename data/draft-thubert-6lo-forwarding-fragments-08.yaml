abstract:
- content: "<p>Considering that an LLN frame can have a MAC payload below 100 bytes,
    an IPv6 packet might be fragmented into more than 10 fragments at the 6LoWPAN
    layer. In a 6LoWPAN mesh-under network, the fragments can be forwarded individually
    across the mesh, whereas a route-over mesh network, a fragmented 6LoWPAN packet
    must be reassembled at every hop, which causes latency and congestion. This draft
    introduces a simple protocol to forward individual fragments across a route-over
    mesh network, and, regardless of the type of mesh, recover the loss of individual
    fragments across the mesh and protect the network against bloat with a minimal
    flow control.</p>"
