abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup
    in\nP2PSIP.  The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocol\nproposed
    by other authors as generic framework for a distributed SIP\nLocation Service.
    \ Although the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draft\nby a newer approach based
    on a binary protocol named RELOAD, we are\nstill considering this SIP-based approach,
    due to implementation\nsimplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP
    stack\nimplementations, easy integration into existing UAs, minimization of\nthe
    number of required protocols for a P2P UA, and widespread support\nfor (and relative
    maturity of) the SIP standard.\n\t </p>\n      "
