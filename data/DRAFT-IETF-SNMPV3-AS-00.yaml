abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document attempts to put in perspective the use of cryptographic\nalgorithms
    in the Simple Network Monitoring Protocol Version 3\nstandard.  In particular,
    it notes that today's standard is\ninfinitely more secure than previous versions,
    as the previous\nversions had zero security.  It further notes that, as cryptographic\nalgorthim
    developments change over time, we expect that the\nrecommended algorithms will
    change when the security community has\nreached new consensus.\n\t </p>\n      "
