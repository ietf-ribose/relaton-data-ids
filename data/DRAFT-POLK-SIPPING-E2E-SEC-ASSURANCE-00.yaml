abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has existing mechanisms
    for \n   securing its signaling messages.  SIP has several transport \n   layers
    it works across: TCP, UDP, SCTP, and TLS over TCP.  There \n   currently is no
    mechanism to ensure that if TLS over TCP is chosen \n   by the originating UAC,
    the messaging will remain encrypted on a \n   hop-by-hop basis to the destination
    UAS.  This document discusses \n   this scenario, providing the requirements for
    such to exist, and \n   offering pieces of a possible solution for this set of
    requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
