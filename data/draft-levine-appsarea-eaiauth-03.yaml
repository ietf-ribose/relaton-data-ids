abstract:
  content: "<p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC enable a domain owner to publish e-mail authentication
    and policy information in the DNS. In internationalized e-mail, domain names can
    occur both as U-labels and A-labels. The Authentication-Results header reports
    the result of authentication checks made with SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and other schemes.
    This specification clarifies when to use which form of domain names when using
    SPF, DKIM, and DMARC and when creating Authentication- Results headers.</p>"
