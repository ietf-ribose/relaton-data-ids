abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 is a mechanism for dynamically configuring
    IPv4\n   over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with\n
    \  some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and deployment scenarios, the\n   operator
    needs to know the /128 IPv6 address that the client will use\n   as the source
    of IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel.  This address, in\n   conjunction with the clients
    IPv4 address and (in some deployments),\n   the Port Set ID are used to create
    a binding table entry in the\n   operator's softwire tunnel concentrator.  This
    memo defines a DHCPv6\n   option to convey IPv6 parameters for establishing the
    softwire tunnel\n   and a DHCPv4 option (to be used only with DHCP 4o6) to communicate\n
    \  the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and\n   server.
    \ It is designed to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address\n   allocation process.
    \ This document updates \"DHCPv6 Options for\n   Configuration of Softwire Address
    and Port-Mapped Clients\" to allow\n   the DHCPv6 option OPTION_S46_BR(90) to
    appear outside of DHCPv6\n   softwire container options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
