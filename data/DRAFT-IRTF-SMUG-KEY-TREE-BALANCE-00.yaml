abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several  multicast key management schemes such as those proposed
    by \nWallner et al, Wong et al and  Balenson et al are based on a \nmultilevel,
    logical hierarchy (or tree) of key-encrypting keys. When \nused in conjunction
    with a reliable multicast infrastructure, this \napproach results in a highly
    efficient key update mechanism in which \nthe number of multicast messages transmitted
    upon a membership update\nis proportional to the depth of the tree, which is logarithmic
    in the \nsize of the secure multicast group, provided the tree is maintained in\na
    balanced manner. Therefore the issue of maintaining such trees in a \nbalanced
    manner is quite relevant in practice. This draft which \nis based on the design
    principles followed in an implementation of \nsecure multicast using the Wallner
    key-management scheme, describes \nefficient techniques to maintain a balanced
    key tree in the presence\nof arbitrary group membership updates. This draft also
    describes \nother optimizations which were found to be useful in practice.\n\n\n\n\t
