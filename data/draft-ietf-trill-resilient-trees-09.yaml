abstract:
- content: "<p>The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides
    multicast data forwarding based on IS-IS link state routing. Distribution trees
    are computed based on the link state information through Shortest Path First calculation.
    When a link on the distribution tree fails, a campus-wide re-convergence of this
    distribution tree will take place, which can be time consuming and may cause considerable
    disruption to the ongoing multicast service. This document specifies how to build
    backup distribution trees to protect links on the primary distribution tree. Since
    the backup distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure, when a link
    on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup forwarding table
    will be utilized to deliver multicast packets without waiting for the campus-wide
    re-convergence. This minimizes the service disruption. This document updates RFC
    6325.</p>"
