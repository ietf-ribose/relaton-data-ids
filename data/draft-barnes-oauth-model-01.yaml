abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the security model for the OAuthauthorization
    system, which allows a party that holds someauthorization to delegate a subset
    of that authorization to anotherparty, without requiring either party to disclose
    its credentials tothe other. In this document, we describe a set of designconstraints,
    a high-level work flow for establishing authorizationssubject to those constraints,
    and set of security requirements forprotocols that implement this model.</p>"
