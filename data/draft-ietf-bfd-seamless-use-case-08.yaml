abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes various use cases for Seamless Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) and provides requirements such that protocol mechanisms
    allow for simplified detection of forwarding failures. These use cases support
    S-BFD, which is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of
    negotiation aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session.
    The benefits of S-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control
    and flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring.</p>"
