abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture and solutions of using\n
    \  virtual Customer Edge (vCE) of BGP IP MPLS VPN. The solution is aimed\n   at
    providing efficient service delivery capability through CE\n   virtualization,
    and is especially beneficial in virtual Private Cloud\n   (vPC) environments when
    extending IP MPLS VPN into tenant virtual\n   Data Center containers. This document
    includes: BGP IP MPLS VPN\n   virtual CE architecture; Control plane and forwarding
    options; Data\n   Center orchestration processes; integration with existing WAN\n
    \  enterprise VPNs; management capability requirements; and security\n   considerations.
    The solution is generally applicable to any BGP IP\n   VPN deployment. The virtual
    CE solution is complementary to the\n   virtual PE solutions.\n\n   Today's data
    center's require multi-tenancy and mechanisms to\n   establish overlay network
    connectivity. This document describes one\n   approach to enabling data center
    network connectivity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
