abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a derived PNAT mechanism that hosts do notneed
    IPv4 addresses, neither public, private nor faked IPv4 address.PNAT solution was
    first proposed by Huang &amp; Deng in [PNAT], whichprovides application-level
    transparency for hosts in IPv4 and IPv6hybrid environments via host-based IPv4/IPv6
    translation technique. This specification addresses one of the PNAT scenarios
    where a hostis provided IPv6 only network connectivity. Two IPv6 addresses willbe
    assigned to a PNAT host. One is native IPv6 address, and the otheris a PNAT IPv6
    address. In this case, IPv4- originated communicationsstill need to be translated
    into IPv6. However, the host does notneed to be assigned an IPv4 address. Instead,
    a PNAT IPv6 addresswill take the place of the originally required IPv4 address.Twoformats
    of PNAT IPv6 address,4rd (IPv4 Rapid Deployment) address and4rm (IPv4 Rapid Migration)
    address, are defined.The advantage of the derived PNAT mechanism is that such
    IPv6 PNAThost supports both IPv4 and IPv6 applications, with SIMPLICITY,SCALABILITY
    and without worrying about any IPv4 address allocatingissue.</p>"
