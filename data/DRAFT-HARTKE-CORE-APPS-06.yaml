abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The interfaces of RESTful, hypermedia-driven Web applications
    consist\n   of reusable components such as Internet media types and link relation\n
    \  types.  This document proposes CoRE Application Descriptions, a\n   convention
    for application designers to describe the programmable\n   interface of their
    Web application in a structured way so that other\n   parties can easily develop
    interoperable clients and servers or reuse\n   the components in their own applications.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
