abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes version 2 of RSRR, a routing interface for
    RSVP.\n   By using this interface, RSVP may obtain forwarding information from\n
    \  routers and use it to place reservation state within the network.\n   Version
    1 of this interface was designed primarily for RSVP\n   interaction with IPv4
    multicast routing protocols.  Version 2 adds\n   support for IPv4 unicast as well
    as IPv6 unicast and multicast\n   routing.  A backwards compatibility mechanism
    is provided.\n\t </p>\n      "
