abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate\n
    \  application layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth\n   core networks.
    \ The type of information and interactions needed to\n   perform various optimizations
    is described. In addition, extensions\n   to the existing ALTO protocol are suggested
    that provide this\n   functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
