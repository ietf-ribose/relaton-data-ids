abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document gives examples of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)\ntelephony
    services.  This covers most features offered in so-called\nCentrex offerings from
    local exchange carriers and PBX (Private\nBranch Exchange) features.  Most of
    the services shown in this\ndocument are implemented in the SIP User Agents, although
    some\nrequire the assistance of a SIP Proxy.  Some require some extensions\nto
    SIP including third party call control (3pcc) extensions such as\nthe REFER method.
    These features are not intented to be an exhaustive\nset, but rather show implementations
    of common features likely to be\nimplemented on SIP IP Telephones in a business
    environment.\n\t </p>\n      "
