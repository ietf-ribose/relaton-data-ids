abstract:
- content: "<p>Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences about
    the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based on the domain
    names at which they are offered. At present, it is not possible to ascertain organizational
    administrative boundaries in the DNS, therefore such inferences can be erroneous
    in various ways. Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale. This memo
    outlines what issues are to be addressed.</p>"
