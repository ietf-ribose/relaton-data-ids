abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the TinyIPFIX protocol that is used for transmitting
    smart-metering data in constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
    Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN, RFC 4944). TinyIPFIX is derived from IP Flow
    Information Export (RFC 7011) and adopted to the needs of constrained networks.
    This document specifies how the TinyIPFIX Data and Template Records are transmitted
    in constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN and how TinyIPFIX data can be converted
    into data that is not TinyIPFIX in a proxy device.</p>"
