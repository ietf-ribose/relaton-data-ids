abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to integrate Password-Authenticated Key
    Agreement (PAKE) schemes into TLS. These schemes enable two parties who share
    a potentially weak password to derive a common cryptographic key, allowing them
    to establish a secure channel. The current document defines a generic way to integrate
    PAKE schemes into TLS. In addition, it demonstrates how to use the well-known
    Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) scheme in TLS as an example
    for the generic construction.</p>"
