abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension that causes nodes to generate
    global scope addresses with randomized interface identifiers that change over
    time. Changing global scope addresses over time limits the window of time during
    which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform address-based
    network activity correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions
    by the same node. Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a node via
    an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication. This document
    obsoletes RFC4941.</p>"
