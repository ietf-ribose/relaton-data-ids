abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a potential performance issue in DECADE
    to\n   support real-time applications.  It shows the current content hashing\n
    \  based naming scheme might harm the performance when the content data\n   is
    generated in real time and low propagation latency of the data is\n   required.
    \ This draft propose a new naming scheme and protocol,\n   subscribe/unsubscribe,
    for real-time applications to address the\n   problem caused by content hashing.
    \ DECADE clients use subscribe/\n   unsubscribe to express their interests to
    receive data streaming.\n   DECADE servers pro-actively push stream data to eligible
    clients,\n   which saves the time consumed on exchanging the hashing of new\n
    \  generated data.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
