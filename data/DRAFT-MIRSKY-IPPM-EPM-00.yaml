abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the error performance metric
    to\n   characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre-\n   defined
    set of performance objectives.  In this document, metrics\n   that characterize
    error performance in a PSN are defined, as well as\n   methods to measure and
    calculate them.  Also, the requirements for an\n   active OAM protocol to support
    EPM in PSN are discussed, and\n   potential candidate protocols analyzed.  All
    metrics and measurement\n   methods are equally applicable to underlay and overlay
    networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
