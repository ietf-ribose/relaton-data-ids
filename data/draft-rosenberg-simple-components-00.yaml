abstract:
  content: "<p>The SIMPLE working group has developed a core set of specificationsfor
    messaging and presence functionality. However, those protocolsalone are not sufficient
    to build a complete IM and presenceapplication. In this document, we advocate

    We also propose some simple solutions for several ofthem to allow for interop.</p>"
