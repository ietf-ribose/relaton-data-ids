abstract:
  content: "<p>With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content isavailable
    from multiple sources. In tomorrow's Internet hosts willhave multiple paths to
    reach one destination host with the deploymentof dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 hosts, but
    also with new techniques such asshim6 or other locator/identifier mechanisms being
    discussed withinthe IRTF RRG. All these hosts will need to rank paths in order
    toselect the best paths to reach a given destination/content. In thisdraft, we
    propose an informed path selection service that would bequeried by hosts and would
    rank paths based on policies andperformance metrics defined by the network operator
    to meet histraffic engineering objectives. A companion document describes aprotocol
    that implements this service.</p>"
