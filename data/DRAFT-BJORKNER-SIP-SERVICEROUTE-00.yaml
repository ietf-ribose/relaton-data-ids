abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a SIP header extension to allow for a UAC
    or \noutbound proxy to determine a request path through an initial set of \ndownstream
    SIP proxies, i.e. a loose route mechanism. This is useful \nin scenarios of distributed
    service execution if for example a UA is \nlocated in a visited network and want
    have originating services \nexecuted in the user's home network. \nThis solution
    is also applicable in the scenarios required by 3GPP \nin conjunction with the
    proposed path header.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
