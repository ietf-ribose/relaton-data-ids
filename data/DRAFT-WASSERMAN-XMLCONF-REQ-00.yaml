    a standard network configuration protocol, which could be used\nto manage the
    configuration of networks and networking equipment.\nThe document also discusses
    a phased approach to developing an XML-\nbased configuration protocol that could
    provide tangible benefits\nin the short term, while working towards an XML-based
    configuration\nprotocol that meets the full requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
