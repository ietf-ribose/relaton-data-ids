abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The use of large-scale IP address sharing technologies (commonly\n
    \  known as \"Carrier-Grade NAT\" and \"A+P\") presents a challenge for law\n
    \  enforcement agencies due to the fact that incoming source port\n   information
    is not routinely logged by Internet-facing servers.  The\n   absence of this information
    means that it is becoming increasingly\n   difficult for law enforcement agencies
    to identify suspects in\n   criminal activity online.  This document considers
    the reasons why\n   source port information is not routinely logged by Internet-facing\n
    \  servers and proposes some immediate-term actions that can be taken to\n   help
    improve the situation.  A deployment maturity model has been\n   developed and
    a study of the support for logging incoming source port\n   information in common
    server software is also presented.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
