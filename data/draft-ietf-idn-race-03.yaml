abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a transformation method for representingnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completelycompatible with the
    current DNS. It is a potential candidate for anASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE)
    for internationalized host names, asdescribed in the comparison document from
    the IETF IDN Working Group.This method is based on the observation that many internationalizedhost
    name parts will have all their characters in one row of the ISO10646 repertoire.</p>"
