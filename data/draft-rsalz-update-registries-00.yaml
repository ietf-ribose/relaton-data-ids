abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Network Time Security (NTS) documents
    define a number of assigned number registries, collectively called the NTP registries.
    Some registries have wrong values, some registries do not follow current common
    practice, and some are just right. For the sake of completeness, this document
    defines all current registries. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found
