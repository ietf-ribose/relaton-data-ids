abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology
    for\n   next-generation network security devices including next-generation\n   firewalls
    (NGFW), intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/\n   IPS) and unified
    threat management (UTM) implementations.  The\n   document aims to strongly improve
    the applicability, reproducibility\n   and transparency of benchmarks and to align
    the test methodology with\n   today's increasingly complex 7application use cases.
    \ The main areas\n   covered in this document are test terminology, traffic profiles
    and\n   benchmarking methodology for NGFWs to start with.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
