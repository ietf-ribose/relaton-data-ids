abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most
    promising candidate technologies for the future data transmission network. The
    GMPLS has been developed to control and cooperate different kinds of network elements,
    such as conventional routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (DWDM) systems, Add- Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs),
    optical cross-connects (OXCs), etc. Dynamic provisioning ability of these physically
    diverse devices differs from each other drastically. At the same time, the need
    for dynamically provisioned connections is increasing because optical networks
    are being deployed in metro area. As different applications have varied requirements
    in the provisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to define
    standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance of networks and
    application needs can be mapped to each other. This document provides a series
    of performance metrics to evaluate the dynamic LSP provisioning performance in
    GMPLS networks, specifically the dynamical LSP setup/release performance. These
    metrics can depict the features of the GMPLS network in LSP dynamic provisioning.
    They can also be used in operational networks for carriers to monitor the control
    plane performance in realtime.</p>"
