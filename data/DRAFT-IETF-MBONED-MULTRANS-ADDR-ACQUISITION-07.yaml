abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning\n
    \  program information including addresses of the multicast groups\n   corresponding
    to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver.\n   During the transition from
    IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where\n   the IP version supported by the receiver
    differs from that supported\n   by the source.  This memo examines what has to
    be done to allow the\n   receiver to acquire multicast address information in
    the version it\n   supports in such scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
