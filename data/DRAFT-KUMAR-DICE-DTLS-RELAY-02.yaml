abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 6LoWPAN and CoAP standards defined for resource-constrained\n
    \  devices are fast emerging as the de-facto protocols for enabling the\n   Internet-of-Things
    (IoTs).  Security is an important concern in IoTs\n   and the DTLS protocol has
    been chosen as the preferred method for\n   securing CoAP messages.  DTLS is a
    point-to-point protocol relying on\n   IP routing to deliver messages between
    the client and the server.\n   However in some low-power lossy networks (LLNs)
    with multi-hop, a new\n   \"joining\" device may not be initially IP-routable.
    \ Moreover, it\n   exists in a separate, unauthenticated domain at the point of
    first\n   contact and therefore cannot be initially trusted.  This puts\n   limitations
    on the ability to use DTLS as an authentication and\n   confidentiality protocol
    at this stage.  These devices being\n   Resource-constrained often cannot accommodate
    more than one security\n   protocol in their code memory.  To overcome this problem
    we suggest\n   DTLS as the single protocol and therefore, we present a DTLS Relay\n
    \  solution for the non-IP routable \"joining\" device to enable it to\n   establish
    a secure DTLS connection with a DTLS Server.  Furthermore\n   we present a stateful
    and stateless mode of operation for the DTLS\n   Relay.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
