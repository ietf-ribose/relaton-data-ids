abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces PSN independent overlay network (PION)\n
    \  architecture for intra- and inter-datacenter (DC) connections.  The\n   motivations,
    protocol layers, applications, and etc, for PION are\n   also discussed.  PION
    provides a virtualized underlying-PSN-\n   independent network in order to maximize
    the reuse of IETF protocol\n   definitions and implementations.  The inter- and
    intra-DC connection\n   provided by PION could be from endpoint to endpoint, or
    endpoint to\n   network, or network to network.  The packet transport capabilities\n
    \  provided by the overlay network are determined by the capability of\n   the
    underlying PSN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
