abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft reviews requirements and evaluates solutions to improve\nthe
    integration of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n[RFC3261] to the Real Time
    Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2)\n[RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] especially in the
    context of converged media\nservices. The document develops a rationale and solution
    space for \nusing SIP with streaming media applications. This is done by first
    \nconsidering use cases that are used to define generic requirements\nto help
    compare the current and potentially new solutions. The\nrange of solutions is
    sketched out (at high-level) and advantages and\ndisadvantages discussed. The
    solutions evaluated address different\nlevels of integration from SIP-only approaches
    to dual-protocol\nsolutions.\n\t </p>\n      "
