abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Address Mapping System that is
    a generic,\n   extensible, and scalable system for mapping network addresses to\n
    \  other network addresses. The Address Mapping System is intended to be\n   used
    in conjunction with overlay techniques which facilitate\n   transmission of packets
    across overlay networks. Information returned\n   by the Address Mapping System
    can include the particular network\n   overlay method to use, as well as instructions
    related to using the\n   method.  The Address Mapping System has a number of potential
    use\n   cases including identifier-locator protocols, network virtualization,\n
    \  and promotion of privacy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
