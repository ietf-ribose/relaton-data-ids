abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer
    Traffic\n   Optimization protocol [RFC7285].  The current ALTO Cost Services only\n
    \  allow applications to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path\n   defined
    by its source and destination.  The present extension\n   provides abstracted
    information on particular network components or\n   elements traversed by a path
    between its source and destination.\n   Examples of such abstracted components
    are networks, data centers or\n   links.  This is useful for applications whose
    performance is impacted\n   by particular network components they traverse or
    by their\n   properties.  Applications having the choice among several connection\n
    \  paths may use this information to select paths accordingly and\n   improve
    their performance.  In particular, they may infer that\n   several paths share
    common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by\n   avoiding such paths.  This
    document introduces a new cost type called\n   Path Vector.  A Path Vector is
    an array of entities that each\n   identifies an abstracted representation of
    a network part and that\n   are called Abstract Network Element (ANE).  Each ANE
    is defined by a\n   set of properties.  ANE properties are conveyed by an ALTO\n
    \  information resource called \"Property Map\", that can be packed\n   together
    with the Path Vectors in a multipart response.  They can\n   also be obtained
    via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map. An\n   ALTO Property Map is an
    extension to the ALTO protocol, that is\n   specified in another document entitled
    \"Unified Properties for the\n   ALTO Protocol\" [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].\n\n\t
