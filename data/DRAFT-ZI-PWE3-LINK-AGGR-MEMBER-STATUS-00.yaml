abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Link Aggregation can be used as Attachment Circuit (AC) of
    the PWE3 \n   service. Link Aggregation is treated as a single interface. But
    \n   changes in the the member interface may affect use of the aggregated \n   link.
    \n\n   This draft suggests a method to signal the status of the member \n   interface
    of Link Aggregation AC to remote Provider Edge (PE) device. \n   With this status
    information, the remote PE can decide to discard \n   traffic over bandwidth,
    avoid congestion at local PE and avoid wasted \n   bandwidth of the Packet Switched
    Network (PSN).  \n\n   This mechanism is required in PWE3 applications because
    pseudo-wires \n   provide layer 1/layer 2 services, carrying traffic that may
    not \n   respond to loss events by executing congestion avoidance \n\t </p>\n
