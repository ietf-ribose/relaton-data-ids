abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a solution for overcoming the limitations
    of\n   existing VPLS multicast solutions. It describes procedures for VPLS\n   multicast
    that utilize multicast trees in the sevice provider (SP)\n   network.  One such
    multicast tree can be shared between multiple VPLS\n   instances.  Procedures
    by which a single multicast tree in the\n   backbone can be used to carry traffic
    belonging only to a specified\n   set of one or more multicast groups from one
    or more VPLSs are also\n   described.\n\t </p>\n      "
