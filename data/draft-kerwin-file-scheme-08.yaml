abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    scheme that was originally specified in [RFC1738]. The purpose of this document
    is to keep the information about the scheme on standards track, since [RFC1738]
    has been made obsolete, and to promote interoperability by resolving disagreements
    between various implementations. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed
    on its github project page [github].</p>"
