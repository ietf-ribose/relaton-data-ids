abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are some subtle considerations for an EAP peer regarding
    the\n   content of the EAP-Response/Identity packet when authenticating with\n
    \  EAP to an EAP server.  This document describes two such\n   considerations
    and suggests workarounds to the associated problems.\n   One of these workarounds
    is a new requirement for EAP peers that the\n   use of UTF-8 is required for the
    content of EAP-Response/Identity\n   (which updates RFC3748).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
