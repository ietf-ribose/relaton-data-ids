abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply
    mobility\n   management for mobile nodes (MN).  For supporting Distributed\n   Mobility
    Management based on current PMIP standard, enhanced Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 (ePMIP)
    with two new logic functions is introduced. (1)\n   Location Management Function
    (LMF), (2) Distributed Anchoring\n   Function (DAF), including Distributed Routing
    sub-Function (DRF) and\n   Distributed Mobility sub-Function (DMF).  Basic signalling
    procedures\n   and considerations are also described in this document.\n\n\n\t
