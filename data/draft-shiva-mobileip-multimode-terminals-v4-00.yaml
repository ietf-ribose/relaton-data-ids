abstract:
  content: "<p>Mobile IP[1] has emerged as a preferred solution for the macro mobilityproblem.
    In this draft, we discuss a possible extension to the existingMobile IPv4 for
    multi-mode wireless terminals. This extension is basedon [2] and has several advantages,
    including lesser packet delay,reduced traffic load on the home agent and lesser
    packet loss duringhandoff. In addition. This also allows the mobile node to take
    fulladvantage of Layer-2 specific features provided by the network. Theproposal
    in this draft is in its initial stage and needs to be furtherstudied.</p>"
