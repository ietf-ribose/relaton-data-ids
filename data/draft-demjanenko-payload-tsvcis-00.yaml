abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RTP payload format for the Tactical Secure
    Voice Cryptographic Interoperability Specification (TSVCIS) speech coder. TSVCIS
    is a scalable narrowband voice coder supporting varying encoder data rates and
    fallbacks. It is implemented as an augmentation to the Mixed Excitation Linear
    Prediction Enhanced (MELPe) speech coder by conveying additional speech coder
    parameters for enhancing voice quality. TSVCIS augmented speech data is processed
    in conjunction with its temporal matched MELP 2400 speech data. The RTP packetization
    of TSVCIS and MELPe speech coder data is described in detail.</p>"
