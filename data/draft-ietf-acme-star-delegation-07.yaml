abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management
    Environment (ACME) protocol by which the owner of an identifier (e.g., a domain
    name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate
    subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds
    to a private key controlled by the third party. A primary use case is that of
    a Content Delivery Network (CDN, the third party) terminating TLS sessions on
    behalf of a content provider (the owner of a domain name). The presented mechanism
    allows the owner of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke
    it at any time. A key property of this mechanism is it does not require any modification
    to the deployed TLS ecosystem.</p>"
