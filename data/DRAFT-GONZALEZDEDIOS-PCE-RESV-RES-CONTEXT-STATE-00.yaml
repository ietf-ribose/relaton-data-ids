abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   A limited form of statefulness
    is useful to improve PCE functionality\n   in situations in which the local TED
    might not be up to date, or in\n   the case of concurrent requests where most
    of the LSPs are computed\n   before the end of the set-up of the LSPs when the
    TED is updated.\n   The PCE can retain some context from the resources assigned
    to Path\n   Requests during a certain period of time, so that it avoids\n   suggesting
    the use of the same resources for subsequent TE LSPs.\n\n   This document proposes
    an extension to the PCEP protocol to allow the\n   PCC to request the PCE to block
    or reserve the resources computed in\n   a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent
    requests for a certain\n   time.\n\t </p>\n      "
