abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Several industry fora have joined forces and are developing an
    \ninformation base from which APIs can be developed.  These APIs, \nexposed to
    the world in Java or OMG IDL, provide access to \ncapabilities of the converged
    (i.e., packet/circuit, wired/wireless) \nNext Generation Network (NGN) in a network
    technology independent \nfashion.  Additionally, the SPIRITS protocol provides
    access to \nthese capabilities.\n\t </p>\n      "
