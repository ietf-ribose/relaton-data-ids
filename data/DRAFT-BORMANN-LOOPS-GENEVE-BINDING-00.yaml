abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide
    local\n   in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to\n
    \  efficiently recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end\n   path
    instead of leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol,\n   traversing the entire
    path.\n\n   [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] defines the information to be carried\n
    \  between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes in a generic way, giving a\n   guideline
    on defining the common elements to embed LOOPS functions in\n   various tunnel
    protocols.  The present document specifies how to\n   embed LOOPS in a specific
    overlay tunnel protocol, Geneve\n   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
