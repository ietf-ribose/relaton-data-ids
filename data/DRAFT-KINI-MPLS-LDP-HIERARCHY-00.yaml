abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to advertise mappings
    of\nForwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) to labels. IP prefix FECs are\nused
    to setup Label Switched Paths (LSPs) along routed paths. LDP\nadvertises label
    mappings for IP Prefix FECs that appear as routes in\nthe route table. As the
    number of FECs in the network increases the\nnumber of labels correspondingly
    increases. During certain failure\nconditions a large number of label mappings
    may have to be generated\nand/or installed in the data plane. In this document
    we describe an\nLDP extension to advertise hierarchical label mappings. This helps
    to\nreduce the number of label mappings that are downloaded during\ncertain failure
    conditions and hence improves convergence times.\n\t </p>\n      "
