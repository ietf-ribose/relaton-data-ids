abstract:
  content: "<p>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configurationmanagement
    protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to performsets of active tests (i.e.,
    verification) against servers' runningconfiguration over a period of time to afford
    the client and server amore robust and resilient configuration management capability.
    Thisis of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as well aswireless
    emergency and military networks. We propose an initial newNETCONF capability,
    i.e., verify. The verify capability is definedin the context of the verify.yang
    module listed in the appendix ofthis document. Associated with the verify operation
    are varioustest.yang modules to be defined elsewhere. However, this documentdefines
    a set of interoperability requirements on the development ofthe test.yang modules
    in order to be controlled through the verifycapability.</p>"
