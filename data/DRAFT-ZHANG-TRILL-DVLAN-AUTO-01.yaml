abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need
    to select\n   out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data\n
    \  forwarding.\n\n   This document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically\n
    \  determine a Designated VLAN on a LAN link for default configured\n   RBridges.
    When a DVLAN has to be changed for the sake of a better\n   connectivity of a
    LAN link, RBridges can change their Designated VLAN\n   with least traffic interruption
    according to the soft Designated VLAN\n   change method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
