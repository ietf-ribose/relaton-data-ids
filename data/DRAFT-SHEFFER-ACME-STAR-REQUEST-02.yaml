abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes a protocol that allows a domain name owner
    to\n   delegate to a third party (such as a CDN) control over a certificate\n
    \  that bears one or more names in that domain.  Specifically the third\n   party
    creates a Certificate Signing Request for the domain, which can\n   then be used
    by the domain owner to request a short term and\n   automatically renewed (STAR)
    certificate.\n\n   This is a component in a solution where a third-party such
    as a CDN\n   can terminate TLS sessions on behalf of a domain name owner (e.g.,
    a\n   content provider), and the domain owner can cancel this delegation at\n
    \  any time without having to rely on certificate revocation mechanisms.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
