abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP speaker that originates an EVPN Ethernet A-D per ES
    route is\n   identified by the next-hop of the route.  When the route is\n   propagated
    by an ASBR as an Inter-AS Option B route, the ASBR\n   overwrites the next-hop.
    \ This document describes a method to\n   identify the originator of the route.\n\n\n\t
