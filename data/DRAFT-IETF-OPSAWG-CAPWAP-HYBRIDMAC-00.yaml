abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split
    and Local\n   MAC (medium access control), which has been described in\n   [RFC5415].There
    are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that\n   have not yet been clearly
    defined whether they belong to either the\n   WTP (Wireless Termination Points)
    or the AC (Access Controller)in the\n   Split and Local modes.  Because different
    vendors have their own\n   definition of these two models, depending upon the
    vendor many MAC\n   layer functions continue to be mapped differently to either
    the WTP\n   or AC.  If there is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC,\n
    \  then operators will not only need to perform vendor specific\n   configurations
    in their network but will continue to experience\n   difficulty in interoperating
    WTPs and ACs from different vendors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
