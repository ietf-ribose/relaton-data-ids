abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet services need asynchronous notifications. At the
    same\ntime there is an increasing number of protocols which use HTTP or\nHTTP-alike
    request-response transactions.\nThis document proposes an extension to application
    protocols which\nenables asynchronous notifications from server to client through\nclient
    initiated request-response transactions. The extension applies\nthe Unix select()
    pattern to TCP connections of HTTP-alike protocols.\nHence it is called HTTP-SELECT.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
