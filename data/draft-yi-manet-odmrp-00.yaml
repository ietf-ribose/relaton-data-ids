abstract:
  content: "\t <t>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routingprotocol
    designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP isa mesh-based, rather than
    a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a forwarding group concept
    (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding). It
    applieson-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain multicast
    group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc wireless networks with mobile
    hosts where bandwidth is limited, topology changes frequently and rapidly, and
    power is constrained.</p>"
