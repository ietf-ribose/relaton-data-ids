abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance\n
    \  (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available to the\n   public
    either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of\n   results of all individual
    tests), or in a very high level human-\n   readable format (e.g. as PDF reports).\n\n
    \  This document argues that there is a need for an intermediate way to\n   provide
    access to large-scale network measurement results, flexible\n   enough to enable
    querying of specific and possibly aggregated data.\n   The Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) Protocol, defined\n   with the goal to provide applications
    with network information, seems\n   a good candidate to fulfill such a role.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
