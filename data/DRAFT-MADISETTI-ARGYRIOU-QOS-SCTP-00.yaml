abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Voice &amp; Video over Internet have strict QoS requirements.
    Generally, low\njitter, low delay and high bandwidth are the critical requirements
    for \nthis class of applications. However, achieving this goal is difficult, \nmore
    so in a wireless/internet environment, where the both networking &amp; \ncommunication
    channel conditions are dynamically changing over time. In \nthis document, we
    propose a novel transport layer protocol that attempts \nto provide better QoS
    for multimedia applications. The purpose of the \nproposed technology is to act
    additively to existing QoS solutions at the lower protocol layers through enhancements
    to the SCTP protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
