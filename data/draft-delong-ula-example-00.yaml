abstract:
- content: "<p>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating documented
    examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address prefix is reserved for use
    in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like. Since the publication
    of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to provide examples of ULA addresses in various
    documents, including some Internet-Drafts currently under consideration. This
    draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation purposes similar to
    the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]</p>"
