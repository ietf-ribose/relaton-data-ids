abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism
    that is\n   distinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable\n
    \  transfer protocols such as TCP.  Using FEC coding can help deal with\n   transfer
    tail losses or with networks having non-congestion losses.\n   However, FEC coding
    mechanisms should not hide congestion signals.\n   This memo offers a discussion
    of how FEC coding and congestion\n   control can coexist.  Another objective is
    to encourage the research\n   community to also consider congestion control aspects
    when proposing\n   and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems.\n\n
    \  This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network\n   Communications
    Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is\n   end-to-end communications:
    FEC coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope\n   of the document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
