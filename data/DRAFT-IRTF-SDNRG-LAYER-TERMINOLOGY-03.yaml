abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach
    for\n   network programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize,\n   control,
    change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open\n   interfaces.  SDN
    emphasizes the role of software in running networks\n   through the introduction
    of an abstraction for the data forwarding\n   plane and, by doing so, separates
    it from the control plane.  This\n   separation allows faster innovation cycles
    at both planes as\n   experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing
    confusion\n   as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer structure in an SDN\n
    \  architecture and how do layers interface with each other.  This\n   document,
    a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research\n   Group (SDNRG),
    addresses these questions and provides a concise\n   reference for the SDN research
    community based on relevant peer-\n   reviewed literature, the RFC series, and
    relevant documents by other\n   standards organizations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
