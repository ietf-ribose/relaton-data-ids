abstract:
- content: "<p>The growth of IPv6 networks started mainly using the transport facilities
    offered by the current Internet. This led to the development of several techniques
    to manage IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. However, classic tunneling methods do not work
    when the IPv6 candidate node is isolated behind a Network Address Translator (NAT)
    device. We propose here a service, called Silkroad, to enable nodes located behind
    one or several IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity. It can provide IPv6 connectivity
    through all existing NAT types and does not require any update of them. In addition,
    Silkroad could provide managed IPv6 prefixes with path optimized routing directly
    between clients.</p>"
