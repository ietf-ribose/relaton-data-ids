abstract:
  content: "\t <t>International Email Addresses (IEA) are far from the global reality.
    Thecurrent de-facto language of the Internet is English. Even today, manyof the
    users of the Internet do not speak English as their primarylanguage. The next
    billion users of the Internet are likely to be evenless familiar with English.
    IEA is probably the first application neededin a truly internationalized Internet.
    The Email AddressInternationalization (EAI) Working Group defined the RFCs to
    supportinternationalized email. The time may now finally have come to developbest
    practices and to discuss the deployment challenges for IEA.</p>"
