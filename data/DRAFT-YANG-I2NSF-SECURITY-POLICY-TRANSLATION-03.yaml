abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a scheme of security policy translation
    (i.e.,\n   Security Policy Translator) in Interface to Network Security\n   Functions
    (I2NSF) Framework.  When I2NSF User delivers a high-level\n   security policy
    for a security service, Security Policy Translator in\n   Security Controller
    translates it into a low-level security policy\n   for Network Security Functions
    (NSFs).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
