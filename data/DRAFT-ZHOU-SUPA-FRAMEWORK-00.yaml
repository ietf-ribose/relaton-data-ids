abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, there are a lot of network services that impose
    specific\n   demands on a communication network, which makes it significantly\n
    \  more challenging to network management and service deployment. SUPA\n   aims
    to provide a set of data models and a framework to simply the\n   deployment and
    management of network services. This document\n   describes the SUPA basic framework
    and its elements. The main SUPA\n   framework entities are the Operation and Management
    Application\n   (OAMA) and the Management Agent (MA). OAMA is a functional entity\n
    \  that creates and runs network services; MA is a functional entity\n   which
    enables the generation, maintenance and release of network\n   topologies and
    network service specific abstractions, and maps\n   network service specific abstractions
    in combination with network\n   topology and policy to detail network element
    configurations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
