abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use
    of\nAuthenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the\ntime
    of the original design there was discussion about the relative\nlocation of the
    authenticated attributes and the encrypted content in\nthe ASN.1 structure.  With
    the benefits of implementation experience\nI revisit the discussion made at the
    time and re-evaluate the\ndecision made.\n\t </p>\n      "
