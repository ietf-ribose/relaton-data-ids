abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the command/response protocol currently
    used\n   in the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and\n   other
    power devices often deployed in small offices, and in IT\n   installations subject
    to an erratic public power supply.  The UPS\n   units typically interface to an
    Attachment Daemon in the system they\n   protect.  This daemon is in turn polled
    by a Management Daemon which\n   notifies users and system administrators of power
    supply incidents,\n   and takes system shutdown decisions.  The commands and responses\n
    \  described by this document are exchanged between the UPS Attachment\n   Daemon
    and the Management Daemon.  Current practice leads to weak\n   security and this
    is addressed in the Security Considerations\n   sections of this document.\n\n\t
