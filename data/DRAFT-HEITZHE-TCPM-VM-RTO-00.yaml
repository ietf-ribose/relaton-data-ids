abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Round Trip Time (RTT) estimate that decays performs badly
    in a\n   bursty environment. A round trip time estimator that does not decay\n
    \  for a period of time is proposed.\n\n   It does not require a minimum value
    to be configured. It works\n   equally well when the typical RTT is 100uS as when
    it is 10 seconds.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
