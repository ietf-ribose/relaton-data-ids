abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides recommendations for the implementation of public-key
    cryptography based on the RSA algorithm, covering cryptographic primitives, encryption
    schemes, signature schemes with appendix, and ASN.1 syntax for representing keys
    and for identifying the schemes. This document represents a republication of PKCS
    #1 v2.2 from RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series.
    By publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF. This document
    also obsoletes RFC 3447.</p>"
