abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>               This document discusses the architecture and protocol
    implications of \n               making network initiation support easier with
    NetLMM. The framework \n               is restricted to inter-technology mobility
    within a single NETLMM \n               domain. It is proposed to add a new NetLMM
    message from the LMA to \n               the MAG, which function is to trigger,
    upon various events, the \n               location registration procedure. Further,
    it is indicated how to \n               complement NetLMM with 802.21 control
    mechanisms to achieve adequate \n               network initiation. \n\n\t </p>\n
