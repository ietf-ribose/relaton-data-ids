abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the long transition period from IPv4-only to IPv6-only,\nnetworks
    will have not only to deploy the IPv6 service but also to\nmaintain some IPv4
    connectivity for a number of customers, and this\nfor both outgoing and incoming
    connections and for both customer-\nindividual and shared IPv4 addresses.  The
    4rd solution (IPv4\nResidual Deployment) is designed as a lightweight solution
    for this.\nIt applies not only to ISPs have IPv6-only routing networks, but also\nto
    those that, during early transition stages, have IPv4-only\nrouting, with 6rd
    to offer the IPv6 service, those that have dual-\nstack routing networks but with
    private IPv4 addresses assigned to\ncustomers.\n\nIn some scenarios, 4rd can dispense
    ISPs from supporting any NAT in\ntheir infrastructures.  In some others it can
    be used in parallel\nwith NAT-based solutions such as DS-lite and/or NAT64/DNS4
    which\nachieve better IPv4-address sharing ratios (but at a price of\nsignificantly
    higher operational complexity).\n\t </p>\n      "
