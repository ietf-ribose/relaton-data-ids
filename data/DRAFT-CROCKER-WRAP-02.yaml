abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MIME is a general-purpose mechanism for labeling and\naggregating
    objects into complex hierarchies. Some MIME\nobjects are discrete objects.  If
    placed within another MIME\nhierarchy, they need to appear as a leaf node in the\ncontaining
    hierarchy, rather than seeming to be continuations\nof that hierarchy.  This specification
    defines Content-type\nApplication/MIME to provide an encapsulation mechanism for\narbitrary
    MIME structures.  This facilitates their treatment\nas a single unit, rather than
    causing them to be treated as\npart of any containing MIME hierarchy.\n\n\t </p>\n
