abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the information
    model for Network Security Functions (NSF) facing interface in Interface to Network
    Security Functions (I2NSF). It describes a data model for the features provided
    by generic security functions. This data model provides generic components whose
    vendors is well understood, so that the generic component can be used even if
    it has some vendor specific functions. These generic functions represent a point
    of interoperability, and can be provided by any product that offers the required
    Capabilities. Also, if vendors need additional features for its network security
    function, they can add the features by extending the YANG data model.</p>"
