abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>An SNMP MIB models a managed device as if every one of its objects\nmay
    be atomically read and changed. In reality, many of a device's\nobjects may be
    interdependent. Typically such dependencies are \neither undocumented or simply
    noted in MIB comments or DESCRIPTION \nclauses. This draft defines a syntax to
    capture MIB object dependencies\nand proposes tools for real-world implementation.\n\t
