abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For concreteness, because the universal character set is not
    yet\n   universal, and because an international standard for the internet\n   community
    should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released\n   with the intention
    of producing an RFC to document the character use\n   and naming conventions of
    the SignWriting community on the Internet.\n\n   The SignWriting Script is an
    international standard for writing sign\n   languages by hand or with computers.
    \ From education to research,\n   from entertainment to religion, SignWriting
    has proven useful because\n   people are using it to write signed languages.  The
    SignWriting\n   Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and\n
    \  Handwriting for the writer.  The script encoding model presented in\n   this
    document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting\n   Script.\n\n
    \  The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing\n   family
    of the SignWriting Script.  The plain text model has been\n   stable since January
    12th, 2012.  The rich text model is currently\n   approaching a usable beta.\n\n
    \  The ad hoc graphemes of informal SignWriting were first created in\n   1974.
    \ Ad hoc graphemes are still used in the handwriting family.\n   The standardized
    symbols of computerized Block Printing text began in\n   1986.  After several
    generations of writers and standardized\n   symbolsets, the ISWA 2010 has been
    optimized and refined as a 16-bit\n   coded character set with several isomorphic
    encodings based on an\n   ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees of significance.  The
    International\n   SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical symbolset that has
    been\n   stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010.\n\n   The SignPuddle
    Standard for SignWriting Text is an open and freely\n   available encoding model
    for sign language as text.  The licenses\n   include the Open Font License for
    the fonts, Creative Commons by-sa\n   (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation,
    and the GPL for the\n   software implementation.  The technological infrastructure
    is 63%\n   completed and should be fully realized by the time this I-D has\n   become
    an RFC.  SignPuddle Online contains almost 1 million examples\n   of 2-dimensional
    signs written by the internet community.  Each\n   logogram has a mathematical
    name which describes the freeform\n   placement of the symbols.  These strings
    are the written record of\n   the sign.  This standard and emerging infrastructure
    are used for the\n   sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia Labs.  This
    standard is\n   being integrated with the SignTyp linguistic coding system developed\n
    \  by Rachel Channon through an NSF grant.  This standard was the origin\n   for
    the alternate Unicode proposals.\n\n   For Unicode, the current use of the Private
    Use Area font characters\n   is documented.  A character proposal for plane 1
    is included that is\n   isomorphic with the characters that are currently used
    by the\n   community.\n\n   Three appendices discuss additional topics to the
    standard.  The\n   first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document,\n
    \  stable since January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the founding\n   principles
    of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for\n   SignWriting Block Printing.
    \ The third discusses a common framework\n   for written sign language grammar.\n\n
    \  This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for\n   the
    Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination,\n   implementation,
    and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
