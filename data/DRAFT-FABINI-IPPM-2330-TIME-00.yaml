abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Quality and accuracy of measurements depend on the selection
    of\n   appropriate locations and timers for timestamp acquisition.  This\n   memo
    updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330\n   with new considerations
    on timers, timestamps and time-related\n   definitions with particular focus on
    wireless networks and\n   virtualized hosts.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
