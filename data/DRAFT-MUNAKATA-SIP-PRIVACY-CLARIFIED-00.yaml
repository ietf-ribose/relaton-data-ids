abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the privacy mechanisms for the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Specifically, guidelines are provided for\n   the
    creation of messages that do not divulge personal identity\n   information.  A
    \"privacy service\" logical role for intermediaries is\n   defined to answer some
    privacy requirements that user agents cannot\n   satisfy themselves.  Finally,
    means are presented by which a user can\n   request particular functions from
    a privacy service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
