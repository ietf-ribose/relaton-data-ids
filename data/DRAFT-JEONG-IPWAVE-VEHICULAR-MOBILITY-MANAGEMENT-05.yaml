abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM)
    scheme\n   for IP-based vehicular networks.  The VMM scheme takes advantage of
    a\n   vehicular link model based on a multi-link subnet.  With a vehicle's\n   mobility
    information (e.g., position, speed, acceleration/\n   deceleration, and direction)
    and navigation path (i.e., trajectory),\n   it can provide a moving vehicle with
    proactive and seamless handoff\n   along with its trajectory.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
