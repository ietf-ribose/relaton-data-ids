abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via
    header field parameter, "rkeep". The "rkeep" parameter allows a SIP entity to
    indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from its adjacent downstream SIP entity,
    the adjacent downstream SIP entity to indicate willingness to send keep-alives,
    and for SIP entities willing to send keep-alives to inform the receiver about
    the keep- alive interval.</p>
