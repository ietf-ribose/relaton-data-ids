abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge
    in\n   [TRILLPN], was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem at\n
    \  remote RBridges. Based on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated\n   Multicast
    Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT] was introduced to solve the\n   related RPF issues.
    In this document, additional problems are\n   described regarding virtual Bridges
    members' state synchronization in\n   multi-homing scenario, including virtual
    RBridge membership auto\n   discovery, pseudo-nickname static configuration consistency
    check,\n   dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT configuration\n   synchronization
    ,LACP configuration and state synchronization,\n   node/link failure detection,
    MAC table synchronization, DHCP snooping\n   information, and dynamically joined
    VLANs and multicast groups. To\n   address these problems, a communication protocol
    among members of a\n   virtual RBridge group should be provided. Requirements
    for this\n   protocol is also discussed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
