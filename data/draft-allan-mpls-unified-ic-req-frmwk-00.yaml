abstract:
- content: "<p>The definition of a transport profile for MPLS means that MPLS network
    architectures will emerge that combines both managed and control plane driven
    MPLS sub-networks and requires interconnection of same to achieve a unified MPLS
    architecture. This document generalizes the problem of sub-network interconnect,
    discusses issues in general and suggests ways forward.</p>"
