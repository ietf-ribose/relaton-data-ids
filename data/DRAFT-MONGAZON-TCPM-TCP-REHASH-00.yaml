abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The present specification describes a light extension of the TCP\nprotocol
    [RFC793] that allows a TCP transport connection to be\nmaintained operational
    whenever the underlying IP network address of\nits end-points changes.  This includes
    situations where a single-\ninterface host changes its IP address or where a multiple-interface\nhost
    diverts a connection from one interface to another.  The\nmechanism used to maintain
    a transport connection in such situations\nis based on the capability of both
    end-points to \"Rehash\" a TCP\nconnection (rebuild its lookup key) with a new
    IP address in a fast\nand reliable manner.\n\t </p>\n      "
