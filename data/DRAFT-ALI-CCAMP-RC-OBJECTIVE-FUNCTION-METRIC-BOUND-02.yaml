abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     In particular networks such as those used by financial\n
    \    institutions, network performance criteria such as latency are\n     becoming
    as critical to data path selection.  However cost is still\n     an important
    consideration.  This leads to a situation where path\n     calculation involves
    multiple metrics an more complex objective\n     functions.\n\n     When using
    GMPLS control plane, the ingress node may need to\n     request remote node to
    perform path computation or expansion. In\n     such cases, ingress node needs
    to convey the required objective\n     function to the remote node, to enable
    it to perform the desired\n     path computation. Similarly, there are cases the
    ingress needs to\n     indicate a TE metric bound for a loose segment that is
    expanded by\n     a remote node. This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE\n
    \    Protocol to allow an ingress node to request the required objective\n     function
    for the path computation, as well as a metric bound to\n     influence route computation
    decisions at a remote node(s).\n\n     \n\t </p>\n      "
