abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note updates the IPv6 Specification (RFC 2460), specifically\n
    \  commenting on the Hop-by-Hop Options Header (section 4.3) and option\n   format
    and handling (section 4.2).\n\n   It also updates RFC 7045, which noted that RFC
    2460 is widely\n   violated in this respect, but merely legitimized this situation
    with\n   a SHOULD.  The present document tries to address the issue more\n   fundamentally.\n\n
    \  It tries to address the issue.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
