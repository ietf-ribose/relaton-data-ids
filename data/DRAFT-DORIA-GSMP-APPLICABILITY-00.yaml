abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses the applicability of the General Switch\n
    \  Management Protocol, GSMP, to network control protocols such\n   as Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS).   It discusses the\n   need for this protocol to be standardized
    and discusses\n   areas where development is still necessary.  Finally, it\n   recommends
    that the IETF establish a working group with the\n   objective of furthering the
    protocol and  working toward\n   making it a standard.\n\n   A PDF version of
    this draft can be found at: http://www.\n   apocalypse.org/~avri/papers/draft-doria-gsmp-applicability-00.pdf\n\n\n\t
