abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture
    for\n   P2MP service delivery.  A P2MP Policy consists of candidate paths\n   that
    connects the Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves.  The P2MP\n   policy is composed
    of replication segments.  A replication segment is\n   a forwarding instruction
    for a candidate path which is downloaded to\n   the Root, transit nodes and the
    leaves.\n\n   This document describes a simple and efficient mechanism that can
    be\n   used to detect data plane failures in P2MP Policy Candidate Paths\n   (CPs)
    and Path Instances (PIs).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
