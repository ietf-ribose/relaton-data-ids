abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It has been recognized that the success of the MPLS depends on
    the\nability to better support the multiservice traffic integration with\nsome
    levels of service guarantees, which are not feasible to\nimplement with the current
    destination prefix only based packet\nforwarding paradigms.\nThe efficient support
    for these services throughout the network is\nexpected to be possible using label
    based forwarding paradigm in the\nnetwork. Through the use of either RSVP based
    or LDP/CR-LDP based\nsignaling, MPLS can also provide certain QoS guarantees using
    the\nLSPs.\nThe goal of this document is to define a framework for service\ndifferentiation
    in MPLS networks. We discuss a set of services that\nhave been identified so far
    for IP, and  describe the traffic\nmanagement mechanisms in various network elements
    that are needed\nfor enabling the implementation of these more advanced services
    in\nMPLS networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
