abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is an
    authentication mechanism for devices wishing to access mobile networks. RFC 4187
    (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible within the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) framework. RFC 5448 (EAP-AKA') was an improved version of EAP-AKA.
    This memo is the most recent specification of EAP-AKA', including, for instance,
    details and references about related to operating EAP- AKA' in 5G networks. EAP-AKA'
    differs from EAP-AKA by providing a key derivation function that binds the keys
    derived within the method to the name of the access network. The key derivation
    function has been defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). EAP-AKA'
    allows its use in EAP in an interoperable manner. EAP-AKA' also updates the algorithm
    used in hash functions, as it employs SHA-256 / HMAC- SHA-256 instead of SHA-1
    / HMAC-SHA-1 as in EAP-AKA. This version of EAP-AKA' specification specifies the
    protocol behaviour for both 4G and 5G deployments, whereas the previous version
    only did this for 4G.</p>"
