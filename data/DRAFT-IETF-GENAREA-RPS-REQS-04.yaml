abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in
    its\n   activities for many years, and some IETF participants have also used\n
    \  their own tools when they felt the need arise.  The IETF now wishes\n   to
    support enhanced remote participation that is as seamless as\n   possible, improving
    the experience for the remote attendee without\n   degrading the experience for
    the people that are physically present.\n   Before deploying the new tools and
    services needed for this enhanced\n   remote participation, the requirements for
    such tools and services,\n   and the impacts they will make on the current procedures
    and\n   infrastructure, must be defined.  This document is meant to be that\n
    \  definition.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
