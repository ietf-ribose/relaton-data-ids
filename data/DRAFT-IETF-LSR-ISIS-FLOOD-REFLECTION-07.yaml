abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a backwards compatible, optional IS-IS\n
    \  extension that allows the creation of IS-IS flood reflection\n   topologies.
    \ Flood reflection allows topologies in which L1 areas\n   provide transit forwarding
    for L2 using all available L1 nodes\n   internally.  It accomplishes this by creating
    L2 flood reflection\n   adjacencies within each L1 area.  Those adjacencies are
    used to flood\n   L2 LSPDUs, and they are used in the L2 SPF computation.  However,\n
    \  they are not used for forwarding within the flood reflection cluster.\n   This
    arrangement gives the L2 topology significantly better scaling\n   properties.
    \ As additional benefit, only those routers directly\n   participating in flood
    reflection have to support the feature.  This\n   allows for the incremental deployment
    of scalable L1 transit areas in\n   an existing network, without the necessity
    of upgrading other routers\n   in the network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
