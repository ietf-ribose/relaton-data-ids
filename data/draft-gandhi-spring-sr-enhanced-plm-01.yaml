abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document defines procedure for Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring (PDLM)
    in Segment Routing networks. The procedure uses the probe messages defined in
    RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) and RFC 8762 (Simple
    Two- Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)) for SR Paths including SR Policies
    with both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</p>"
