abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire
    of\n   differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the\n
    \  traffic steering service under limited network resources and maximize\n   their
    benefits at the same time.  The traditional method for traffic\n   steering depends
    on static configuration which is time consuming and\n   error-prone.  As development
    of SDN, the controller is introduced for\n   traffic steering with the global
    view of network topology and route\n   information.  This document describes typical
    use cases for traffic\n   steering services and proposes the traffic steering
    solution based on\n   BGP controller.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
