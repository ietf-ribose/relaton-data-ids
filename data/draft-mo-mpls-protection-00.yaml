abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF
    meetings.Various drafts have different proposals on establishing the workingand
    protection LSP ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for theprotection LSP has
    not be discussed. If the bandwidth for theprotection LSP is reserved in a similar
    fashion as that of the workingLSP, the bandwidth utilization in the network would
    be very poor.In this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth for protection
    LSPis presented which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation forsingle fault
    protection.</p>"
