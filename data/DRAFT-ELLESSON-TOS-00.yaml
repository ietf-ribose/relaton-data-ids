abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes an arrangement of fields in the IPv4 TOS byte\n
    \  [RFC795, RFC1349], and in the IPv6 Traffic Class byte [IPv6], and\n   proposes
    a definition for their associated semantics. The intention\n   is to enable the
    preservation of currently useful differential class-\n   based queueing behavior
    on existing network devices, while\n   simultaneously enabling new methods of
    bandwidth allocation and\n   policing via drop preference, all within the context
    of flows which\n   may be encrypted at the IP layer using IPSEC.\n \n   (Note:
    the IPv6 Class field has recently been expanded to eight bits,\n   but this in
    not yet available in any version of the specification).\n\t </p>\n      "
