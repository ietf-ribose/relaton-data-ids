abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the potential benefits when applications enable
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). It outlines the principal gains in terms
    of increased throughput, reduced delay and other benefits when ECN is used over
    network paths that include equipment that supports ECN-marking. It also identifies
    some potential problems that might occur when ECN is used. The document does not
    propose new algorithms that may be able to use ECN or describe the details of
    implementation of ECN in endpoint devices, routers and other network devices.</p>"
