abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches assuming
    that the information provided is static for a longer period of time. The purpose
    of this memo is to provide a mechanism where ALTO clients cache the map information
    and the servers provide the expiration time for invalidation.</p>"
