abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of the blockchain transaction protocol for constraint
    nodes\n   is to enable the generation of blockchain transactions by constraint\n
    \  nodes, according to the following principles :\n   - transactions are triggered
    by Provisioning-Messages that include\n   the needed blockchain parameters.\n
    \  - binary encoded transactions are returned in Transaction-Messages,\n   which
    include sensors/actuators data. Constraint nodes, associated\n   with blockchain
    addresses, compute the transaction signature.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
