abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>With the proliferation of IP based internetworking services to
    mass\nbusiness and consumer markets carriers are faced with operational\nchallenges
    in an extent never before experienced in previous LAN MAN\nor WAN environments.
    \ To accommodate these new internetworking envi-\nronments, carrier workflow management
    applications for service Ful-\nfillment, Assurance, and Billing (FAB) need to
    undergo major a tran-\nsition.  In essence applications need to transition from
    being per\ntechnology centric to being service centric, as historic correspon-\ndence
    between technology and service is no longer true. Applications\ndo not need to
    change in nature, since they still need to support\ninventory, CRM, order and
    other workflows.  However, applications\nneed to include a service centric aspect
    as basis for these work-\nflows.\nService Centric solutions can be shared by a
    wide range of management\nand workflow applications, rather than be re-invented
    by each one.\nService Centric Management solutions must be distributed in order
    to\ncope with the massive scale and complexity challenges of the underly-\ning
    networks.  Service Centric Management Protocol (SCMP) and distri-\nbution should
    be standardized to facilitate multi-vendor interoper-\nability in this emerging
    space, allow for potential future embedding\nwithin NE, and to allow for Service
    Centric Management primitives to\nextend across Inter Carrier Interfaces (ICI)
    and inner carrier regu-\nlatory bounds.\n\t </p>\n      "
