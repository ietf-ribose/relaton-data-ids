abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines how a membership test can be used to convey
    allor some of the EID-to-RLOC mappings from an Egress Tunnel Router torequesting
    Ingress Tunnel Router. This draft proposes that anauthoritative ETR MAY return
    a group membership test in the LISP Map-Reply Message that indicates if a given
    EID is served by the ETR.The membership test is implemented as a Bloom filter.
    A Bloom filteris compact data structure to represent a set of elements. Themembership
    test \"aggregates\" EIDs beyond prefix based aggregation.Membership test decreases
    the load of the mapping system anddistributes the EID-to-RLOC resolution between
    an ITR and an ETR.</p>"
