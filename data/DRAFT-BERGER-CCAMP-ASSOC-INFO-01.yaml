abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS\n(Generalized
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching) controlled label\nswitched paths (LSPs).  In this
    context, the object is used to\nassociate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are
    protecting.  This\nobject also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate\nRSVP
    state, and this document defines how the ASSOCIATION object\ncan be more generally
    applied.  The document also reviews how the\nassociation is to be provided in
    the context of GMPLS recovery.\nNo new new procedures or mechanisms are defined
    with respect to\nGMPLS recovery.\n\t </p>\n      "
