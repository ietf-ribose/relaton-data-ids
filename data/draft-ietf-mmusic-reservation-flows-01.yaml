abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines an extension to the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) grouping framework. It allows requesting a group of media streams to be
    mapped into a single resource reservation flow. The SDP syntax needed is defined,
    as well as a new \"semantics\" attribute called Single Reservation Flow (SRF).
