abstract:
  content: "<p>Currently Mobile IP WG is carrying out very interesting work in thearea
    of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. Thehigh level goal
    of this work is to reduce the latency during thechange of point of attachement
    to the Internet (AKA Handoff) Thisdocument discusses one simple case that in the
    author's opinion isvery common and can be optimized to achevie lower latency than
    thatproposed by the various solutions. This scenario applies to both IPv6and IPv4
    work. The solution at a high level is the same, butrealization will be different
    as the frame work in IPv6 case isdifferent from that of the IPv4 case.</p>"
