abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the various internet calendaring and scheduling
    standards and drafts and the relationships between them. It's intention is to
    provide a context for these documents, assist in their understanding, and potentially
    help implementors in the design of their internet calendaring and scheduling systems.
    The standards addressed are RFC 2445 (iCalendar), RFC 2446 (iTIP), and RFC 2447
    (iMIP). The draft addressed is 'Calendar Access Protocol' (CAP).</p>"
