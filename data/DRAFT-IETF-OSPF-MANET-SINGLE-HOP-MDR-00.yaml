abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs)
    by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type\nMANET.  This document
    describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop\nbroadcast network, which is a special
    case of a MANET in which each\nrouter is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.
    \ Unlike an OSPF\nbroadcast interface, such an interface can have a different
    cost\nassociated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration\nrecommendations
    and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop\nbroadcast networks.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
