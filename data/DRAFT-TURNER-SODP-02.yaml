abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Secure Object Delivery Protocol
    (SODP).\n   SODP enables clients to obtain secured packages from a Secure Object\n
    \  Management System (SOMS).  Packages supported by a SOMS server\n   include
    but are not limited to: firmware packages [RFC4108], trust\n   anchor (TA) packages
    [RFC5934], symmetric key packages [RFC6031],\n   asymmetric key packages [RFC5958],
    encrypted key packages [RFC6031],\n   public key certificate enrollment packages
    [RFC5272], public key\n   certificates [RFC5280], and Certificate Revocation Lists
    (CRLs)\n   [RFC5280].  Client access is ideally direct and web-based, but access\n
    \  via agents acting on behalf of clients is supported.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
