abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the scenarios within which SIP phones may be
    used to contact emergency call centres. Beginning with an overview of the high
    level system requirements for contacting emergency call centres in the PSTN, the
    scenarios involving stationary or nomadic SIP phones are described and then alternative
    strategies for supporting the information flows for the scenarios needed to meet
    these requirements are examined. The major finding from the point of view of SIP
    standardization is it would be helpful in a number of scenarios if a location
    header field could be added either by the SIP phone or by a proxy to indicate
    the location of the phone in a machine-readable way.</p>"
