abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    \nTraffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be \ncomputed by Path
    Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP \ncrosses multiple domains, such
    as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the \npath may be computed by multiple PCEs that
    cooperate, with each \nresponsible for computing a segment of the path. To preserve
    \nconfidentiality of topology with each AS, the PCE supports a \nmechanism to
    hide the contents of a segment of a path, called the \nConfidential Path Segment
    (CPS), by encoding the contents as a \nPath Key Subobject (PKS). This document
    describes the addition of \nthis information to Resource Reservation Protocol
    (RSVP) signaling \nby inclusion in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) and Record
    Route \nObject (RRO).\n\t </p>\n      "
