abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)
    \ndescribed in [RANGI] is a proposal for solving routing scalability, \nmobility,
    multihoming, traffic engineering and other issues facing \nthe current Internet.
    This document describes some transition \nmechanisms for the RANGI. With these
    mechanisms, legacy IPv4 and IPv6 \nhosts can communicate with RANGI hosts, and
    vice versa.\n\t </p>\n      "
