abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an ALTO extension that allows a resource
    to\n   provide not only preferences of network paths but also correlations\n   of
    network paths, including aggregations of network components and\n   their properties
    on the paths between different PIDs or endpoints.\n   The extended information
    can be used to improve the robustness and\n   performance for applications in
    some new usage scenarios, such as\n   high-speed data transfers and traffic optimization
    using in-network\n   storage and computation.  This document introduces abstract
    network\n   element (ANE) as an abstraction for aggregations of network\n   components.
    \ It extends the base protocol and the Unified Property\n   extension to enable
    the capability of encoding such information in a\n   \"path vector\", i.e., an
    array of ANEs that are traversed by traffic\n   from a source to a destination.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
