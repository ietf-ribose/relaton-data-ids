abstract:
  content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLScan
    carry anydata payload which gives the flexibility to the serviceprovider to provision
    new service with any expense.The benefit of thistechnology is core router need
    not understand the full customer route.If the service a layer 2 then thereis no
    need of vrf, for customer theservice provider cloud is like a virtual switch.The
    protocol used forlabel distribution is LDP, BGP,RSVP. The most popular protocol
    forouter label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit of adding more TLV toits
    payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating labelsfor mac address
    rather for ip address which gives the benefit to serviceprovider not to run complex
    routing protocol on core, this does not requireip address. This gives service
    provider the flexibility to deploy any services,there is no need for changes in
    network layer when the customer goes foripv4 to ipv6. This can reduce the CAPEX
    and OPEX of the customer and reducesthe hardware cost too.</p>"
