abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin
    server to\n   describe the cache key for a negotiated response: a short algorithm\n
    \  that can be used upon later requests to determine if the same\n   response
    is reusable.  Key has the advantage of avoiding an\n   additional round trip for
    validation whenever a new request differs\n   slightly, but not significantly,
    from prior requests.  Key also\n   informs user agents of the request characteristics
    that might result\n   in different content, which can be useful if the user agent
    is not\n   sending Accept* fields in order to reduce the risk of fingerprinting.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
