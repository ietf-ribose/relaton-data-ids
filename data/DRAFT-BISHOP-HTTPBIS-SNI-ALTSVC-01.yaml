abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP Alternative Services provides a mechanism for an origin
    to\n   declare that its content is accessible via some other combination of\n
    \  host, port, and protocol.  In the process of using such an\n   alternative,
    an observer can identify that the client is requesting\n   resources from a particular
    hostname.\n\n   This document extends HTTP Alternative Services, in combination
    with\n   Secondary Certificate Authentication, to enable clients not to\n   disclose
    the origin to which they intend to connect.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
