abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This note proposes an HTTP cache-control extension mechanism that\nallows
    caching of authentication credentials, thereby allowing\nauthenticated resources
    to be served from cache without incurring the\ncost of a round-trip to the origin
    server more than once during the\nfreshness lifetime of the credentials.\n\t </p>\n
