abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics\n
    \  compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Deterministic\n   networks
    is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic\n   applications in
    the industrial environment. Some routing metrics\n   and constraints has been
    described in [RFC6551],[RFC5867] [RFC5826],\n   [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There
    are several special characteristics\n   and requirements in the industrial environment.
    This document\n   defines a new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting\n
    \  Time to make RPL support deterministic scheduling mechanism, which\n   could
    improve the determinacy and reliability of the LLNs in\n   industrial environment.\n\n\n\t
