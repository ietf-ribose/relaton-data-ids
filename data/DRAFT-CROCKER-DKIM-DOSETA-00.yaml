abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism
    that\nenables development of a security-related service, such as\nauthentication
    or encryption, with keys based on domain names; the\nname owner can be any actor
    involved in the handling of the data,\nsuch as the author's organization, a server
    operator or one of their\nagents.  The DOSETA Library provides a collection of
    common\ncapabilities, including canonicalization, parameter tagging, and\nretrieval
    of self-certified keys.  The DOSETA Signing Template\naffixes a signature to data
    that is in a \"header/content\" form.\nDefining the meaning of the signature is
    the responsibility of the\nservice that incorporates DOSETA.  The signature is
    validated through\na cryptographic signature and querying the signer's domain
    directly,\nto retrieve the appropriate public key.\n\t </p>\n      "
