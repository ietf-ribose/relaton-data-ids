abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a new type of Route Target called Bitmask Route
    Target as a BGP Community Container. The key element of a Bitmask Route Target
    is a Bitmask. Two Bitmask Route Targets are considered equivalent for the purpose
    of controlling route propagation (via Route Target Constraints) and importation
    if the result of logical "AND" operation of the Bitmask of the two is non- zero.</p>
