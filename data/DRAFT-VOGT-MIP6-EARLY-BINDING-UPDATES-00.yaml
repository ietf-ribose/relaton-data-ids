abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The long latency associated with Mobile IPv6's home-address
    and\n   care-of-address tests can significantly impact delay-sensitive\n   applications.
    We propose a modified binding-update procedure that\n   evades the latency of
    both address tests. The modified binding update\n   runs in half, or less, of
    the time that a standard binding update\n   takes. Moreover, the modified binding
    update is nearly equivalent to\n   the standard procedure with respect to security,
    and it increases the\n   resources required at the correspondent node only marginally.
    The\n   modification is realized as an optional, and fully\n   backward-compatible,
    extension to Mobile IPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
