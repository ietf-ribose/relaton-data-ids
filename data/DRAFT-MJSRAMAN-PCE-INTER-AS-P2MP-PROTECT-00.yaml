abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constructing primary and backup explicit path Point-to-Multipoint\n
    \  Label Switched Paths is important from the point of view of providing\n   protection
    switching in case the primary fails.\n\n   It is absolutely essential that the
    backup P2MP LSPs constructed do\n   not share risk with any of the links and nodes
    of the primary path.\n   In the case of inter-AS P2MP TE-LSPs or in the case of
    inter-sub-AS\n   (in the case of BGP-Confederations being deployed) P2MP TE-LSPs
    where\n   BGP confederations are deployed within an AS, such protection\n   switching
    can be provided by calculating primary and backup multicast\n   distribution trees
    (read P2MP TE-LSPs) that dont intersect with each\n   other.\n\n   In this paper
    we propose a method by which inter-sub-AS P2MP TE-LSPs\n   (hence even inter-AS
    P2MP TE-LSPs) can be constructed by first\n   finding the AS level topology of
    the network (be it inter-AS or\n   inter-sub-AS within a single AS) in question
    and secondly to compute\n   the paths in such a way that they dont intersect or
    if necessary in\n   the worst case partially intersect each other. The proposed
    scheme is\n   explained with an example and subsequent discussion is done to\n
    \  elucidate its benefits to multicast in particular.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
