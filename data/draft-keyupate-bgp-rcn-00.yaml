abstract:
- content: "<p>Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, it triggers
    a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix is completly withdrawn
    from the entire BGP network. This phenomenon is popularly known as _path exploration_
    or _path hunting_ and occurs because of path vector property of BGP. It results
    in a series of unwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network.
    This document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount of such path exploration
    by defining two optional transitive path attributes for BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and
    ROOT_CAUSE.</p>"
