abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes changes to FTP [1], which were proposed by Rick
    Adams in May of 1989, to allow the RESTART mechanism to be used with STREAM mode
    transfers. Along with this, two new optional commands are added, MODIFICATION
    TIME (MDTM) and SIZE OF FILE (SIZE). All these changes have been implemented,
    and are in use today in many production FTP implementations.</p>"
