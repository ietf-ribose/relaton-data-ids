abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A significant part of the next tens of billion of devices that
    will\n   be connected to the Internet will be constrained devices, connecting\n
    \  over constrained networks.  Managing these devices and the networks\n   they
    form in a consistent, scalable, extensible, secure, energy-\n   efficient manner
    with low computational and protocol complexity\n   cannot be done in an ad-hoc
    manner.  This document outlines the\n   problem at hand and provides a roadmap
    of the possible solutions\n   develped at the IETF.  The description includes
    the basic constrained\n   management problem, as well as properties of the solution.
    \ Details\n   as to the Constrained Objecs Language (CoOL) protocol itself can
    be\n   found in companion documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
