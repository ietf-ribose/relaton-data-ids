abstract:
  content: "<p>This document proposes TCP-DCR, a simple modification to the TCPcongestion
    control algorithm to make it more robust to non-congestionevents. In the absence
    of explicit notification from the network, theTCP congestion control algorithm
    treats the receipt of threeduplicate acknowledgements as an indication of congestion
    in thenetwork. This is not always correct, notably so in wireless networkswith
    channel errors or networks prone to excessive packet reordering,resulting in degraded
    performance. TCP-DCR aims to remedy this bydelaying the congestion response of
    TCP for a short interval of timetau, thereby creating room to handle any non-congestion
    events thatmay have occurred. If at the end of the delay tau, the event is nothandled,
    then it is treated as a congestion loss. The modificationsthemselves do not handle
    the non-congestion event, but rather rely onsome underlying mechanism to do this.
    This document discusses theimplications of delaying congestion response on the
    fairness, TCP-compatibility and network dynamics, and the benefits to be gained
    byapplying the TCP-DCR modifications to TCP.</p>"
