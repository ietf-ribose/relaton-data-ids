abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When a mobile node moves to a new point of attachment in theInternet,
    relying on router advertisements may be insufficient toinsure adequate performance
    of time-critical applications running onthe mobile node. In many cases, other
    indications are available totrigger handover of the mobile node to a new point
    of attachment,at a new access router. The mobile node and the access router maythen
    be able to take steps, in addition to those specified for MobileIPv6, to reduce
    the time during which the mobile node is effectivelydisconnected from the Internet.
    This specification defines the fasthandover problem and outlines a proposed solution
    to the problem.</p>"
