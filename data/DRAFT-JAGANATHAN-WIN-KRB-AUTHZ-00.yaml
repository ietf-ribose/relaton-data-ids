abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Microsoft Windows 2000 includes operating system specific data
    in the\n   Kerberos V5  authorization data field that is used for access\n   control.
    \ This data is used to create an NT access token.  The access\n   token is used
    by the system to enforce access checking when\n   attempting to access objects.
    \ This document describes the structure\n   of the Windows 2000 specific authorization
    data that is carried in\n   that field for use by servers in performing access
    control.\n\t </p>\n      "
