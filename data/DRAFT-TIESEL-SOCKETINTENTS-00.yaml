abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines an API-independent concept that allows\n
    \  applications to share their knowledge about upcoming communication\n   and
    express their performance preferences in a portable and abstract\n   way: Socket
    Intents.  Socket Intents express what an application\n   knows, assumes, expects
    or wants to prioritize regarding its own\n   network communication.  The information
    provided by Socket Intents\n   should be taken into account by the network stack
    in a best-effort\n   way.\n\n   Socket Intent can be used to stem against the
    complexity and make use\n   of multiple provisioning domains as well as new transport
    protocols\n   and features available to a larger user base by expressing the\n
    \  applications intents in an abstract and portable way.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
