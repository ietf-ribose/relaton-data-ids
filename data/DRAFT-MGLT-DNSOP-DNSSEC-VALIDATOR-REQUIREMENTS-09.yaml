abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions define a process for validating
    received\n   data and assert them authentic and complete as opposed to forged.\n\n
    \  This document is focused clarifying the scope and responsibilities of\n   DNSSEC
    Resolver Operators (DRO) as well as operational\n   recommendations that DNSSEC
    validators operators SHOULD put in place\n   in order to implement sufficient
    Trust that makes DNSSEC validation\n   output accurate.  The recommendations described
    in this document\n   include, provisioning mechanisms as well as monitoring and
    management\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
