abstract:
- content: "<p>The functions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) are gradually
    migrating to the Internet. This is generating new requirements for many mechanisms
    used by the PSTN, including telephone numbers (TNs). TNs no longer serve simply
    as telephone routing addresses, they are now identifiers which may be used by
    Internet-based services for a variety of purposes including session establishment,
    identity verification and service enablement. This problem statement examines
    how the existing tools for allocating and managing telephone numbers do not align
    with the needs of the Internet environment and proposes a fraemwork for Internet-based
    services relying on TNs.</p>"
