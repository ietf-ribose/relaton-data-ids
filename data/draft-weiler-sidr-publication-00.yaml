abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for publishing Resource Public Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI) objects. Even though the RPKI will have many participants
    issuing certificates and creating other objects, it is operationally useful to
    consolidate the publication of those objects. This document provides the protocol
    for that.</p>"
