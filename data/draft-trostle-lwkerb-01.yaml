abstract:
  content: "<p>The Kerberos V5 protocol [3] allows network entities to authenticateand
    establish shared secret keys. Some network applications wouldbenefit from a lightweight
    authentication mechanism with many of thebenefits of Kerberos, but where the messages
    have fewer bytes thanexisting Kerberos messages. Also, we describe a protocol
    option thatrequires only two messages to be sent and received from the client,to
    support lightweight clients. This document describes a Kerberos-like protocol
    that does not use ASN.1 and is optimized for smallermessages. The protocol makes
    use of existing Kerberos infrastructure.</p>"
