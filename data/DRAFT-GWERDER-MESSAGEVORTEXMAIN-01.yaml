abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MessageVortex Protocol is a protocol to achieve different degrees
    of\n   anonymity.  It specifies messages embedded within existing transfer\n   protocols
    such as SMTP or XMPP to send them via peer nodes to one or\n   more recipients.\n\n
    \  The protocol outperforms other protocols by decoupling transport from\n   the
    final transmitter and receiver party.  There is no trust put into\n   any infrastructure
    except for the infrastructure of the sending and\n   receiving party of a message.
    \ The creator of the routing block has\n   full control over the message flow.
    \ Routing nodes gain no non-\n   obvious knowledge about messages even when collaborating.
    \ Third-\n   party anonymity is always achieved.  Furthermore, the protocol allows\n
    \  achieving either sender or receiver anonymity.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
