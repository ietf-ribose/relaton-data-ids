abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on the design of methods to avoid congestion
    collapse and to provide congestion control. Recommendations and requirements on
    this topic are distributed across many documents in the RFC series. It seeks to
    gather and consolidate these recommendations. This is intended to provide input
    to the design of new congestion control methods in protocols, such as IETF QUIC.
    The present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF.</p>"
