abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomous Systems (ASes) that peer with one another using
    the Border\n   Gateway Protocol (BGP) RFC 4271 [RFC4271] do not have an automated\n
    \  way to tell if the prefixes announced over a particular peering link\n   are
    acceped by the peer.  One way in which an AS operator can verify\n   acceptance
    of routes by a peer is using a looking glass which may be\n   provided by the
    peer, however this introduces manual toil in the\n   operation and turnup of peering
    links, and does not allow for\n   continued validation to ensure there are no
    regressions.  Looking\n   glasses are often manually found by browsing the website
    of the peer\n   or via a database of peering participants.\n\n   This document
    proposes a new in-band mechanism for transmitting\n   administrative data between
    BGP peers, and defines one such use case\n   for propagating looking glass addresses.
    \ This is done via a new\n   Address Family Identifier (AFI) which carries a message
    that we\n   define here, inside the Multi Protocol (MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH) path\n
    \  attribute\n\n   The looking glass that we expose via the proposed mechanism
    conforms\n   to that defined in RFC 8522 [RFC8522].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
