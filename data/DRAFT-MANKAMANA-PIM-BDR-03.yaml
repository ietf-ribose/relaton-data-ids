abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected
    as a\n   Designated Router (DR).  On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is\n   responsible
    for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding\n   traffic to these listeners
    if the group is operating in PIM-SM.  In\n   this document, we propose a mechanism
    to elect backup DR on a shared\n   LAN.  A backup DR on LAN would be useful for
    faster convergence.\n   This draft introduces the concept of a Backup Designated
    Router (BDR)\n   and the procedure to implement it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
