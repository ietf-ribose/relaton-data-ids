abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to automate DNSSEC
    multi-signer [RFC8901] "Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models" setup, operations and decomissioning.
    It primarily deals with Model 2 of the Multi-Signer specification, where each
    operator has their own distinct KSK and ZSK sets (or CSK sets). It makes use of
    [RFC8078] "Managing DS Records from the Parent via CDS/CDNSKEY" and [RFC7477]
    "Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS" to accomplish this.</p>
