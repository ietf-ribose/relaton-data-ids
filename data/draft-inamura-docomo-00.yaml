- content: "<p>The third generation, 3G, wireless networks that enable high-speed
    data transfer are now being introduced. Internet access is one of the most important
    applications of such networks. TCP is one of the key technologies that enable
    Internet applications for such networks. A number of TCP optimization techniques
    have been studied to enhance the performance of TCP transmission for various wireless
    environments.</p>"
