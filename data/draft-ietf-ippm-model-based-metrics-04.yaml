abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined bulk transport performance
    targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The
    subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to key infrastructure, such as
    interconnects, to accurately detect if any part of the infrastructure will prevent
    the full end- to-end paths traversing them from meeting the specified target performance.
    The diagnostic tests consist of precomputed traffic patterns and statistical criteria
    for evaluating packet delivery. The traffic patterns are precomputed to mimic
    TCP or other transport protocol over a long path but are constructed in such a
    way that they are independent of the actual details of the subpath under test,
    end systems or applications. Likewise the success criteria depends on the packet
    delivery statistics of the subpath, as evaluated against a protocol model applied
    to the target performance. The success criteria also does not depend on the details
    of the subpath, endsystems or application. This makes the measurements open loop,
    eliminating most of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport
    metrics. Model based metrics exhibit several important new properties not present
    in other Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability to reason about concatenated
    or overlapping subpaths. The results are vantage independent which is critical
    for supporting independent validation of tests results from multiple Measurement
    Points. This document does not define diagnostic tests directly, but provides
    a framework for designing suites of diagnostics tests that are tailored to confirming
    that infrastructure can meet the target performance.</p>"
