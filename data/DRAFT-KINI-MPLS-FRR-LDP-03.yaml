abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is widely deployed to signal
    Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) due to its simple operational model.  Since LDP\n
    \  establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is\n   gated
    by the interior gateway protocol's (IGP's) re-convergence.\n   Though some mechanisms
    exist to do Fast Re-route (FRR) of LDP LSPs,\n   they suffer from significant
    complexity or lack of full coverage or\n   both.  This document describes a method
    to perform FRR of LDP LSPs\n   that retains the simple operational model of LDP.
    \ The goal is to\n   provide 100% coverage for all failure scenarios including
    Shared Risk\n   Link Group (SRLG) failure with recovery characteristics similar
    to\n   the methods in Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering\n   FRR
    (RSVP-TE-FRR).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
