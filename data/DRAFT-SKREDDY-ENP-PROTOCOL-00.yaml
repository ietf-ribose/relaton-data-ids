abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As  the  complexity  of  distributed  applications   increases,
    \  an\nincreasing amount of processing is done using distributed processes,\nwhich
    typically execute without the direct  supervision  of  an  end\nuser.  The  user
    \ must poll these processes periodically to check if\nthey are completed successfully
    or  not.  This  polling  results  in\nunnecessary  wastage  of  network  bandwidth
    \ as  well  as computing\nresources. The user generally cannot  see  intermediate
    \ results  or\nprogress reports for long running processes, they must wait till
    the\nprocess is completely finished before viewing the results.\nThus the problem
    of monitoring  events  is  central  in  distributed\napplications  and protocols.
    A repeated need in such applications is\nreceive notifications when a  resource
    \ property  value  changes  or\nevent  state  changes.  Current database systems
    provides mechanisms\nlike  constraints,  triggers  and  active  database   rules.
    \  These\nfacilities  provides  an  automated  means  to  ensure  the database\nintegrity
    or perform specific action when  data  changes.  Need  for\nsuch kind of requirement
    is fundamental is network applications\n\n\t </p>\n      "
