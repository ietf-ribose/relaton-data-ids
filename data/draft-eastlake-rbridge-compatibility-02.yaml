abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a layering and peering model for network switches
    and end stations. It also discusses, using this model, the compatibility of RBridges
    (Routing Bridges) with Layer 3 routers and various types of bridges including
    Shortest Path Bridges. RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL (TRansparent
    Interconnection of Lots of Links) standard.</p>"
