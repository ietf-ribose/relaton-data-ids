abstract:
- content: "<p>Global IPv6 deployment is inevitable. There are many solutions have
    been specified in order to provide IPv6 connectivity services. In order to provide
    IPv6 connectivity services to all kinds of host/client devices, ISP networks need
    to support as many as possible IPv6 connectivity solutions. This document proposes
    a hybrid ISP platform that supports the coexistence of variable IPv6 connectivity
    solutions and analyses the configuration requirements raised by this platform.
    Additionally, the applicability of different configuration mechanisms for performing
    this configuration is discussed.</p>"
