abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes protocol extensions to the Kerberos protocol\nspecification.
    \ The extension (hereafter called XKDCP) offers a new\ncross-realm protocol for
    Kerberos.  The XKDCP extension defines a\nprotocol between Kerberos Key Distribution
    Centers (KDCs) that allows\na KDC to build credentials even when the client or
    the requested\nservice is not registered in the KDC's database (but registered
    in\nanother KDC's database).  The XKDCP extension defines two protocols:\nXTGSP
    (Inter Ticket Granting Service Protocol) and XASP (Inter\nAuthentication Service
    Protocol).  The XTGSP protocol can be used in\nremote access scenarios to allow
    the local KDC to deliver credentials\nfor services located in remote realms.  On
    the other hand, the XASP\nprotocol can be used in case of cross-realm roaming
    scenarios to\nallow the visited KDC to deliver credentials for roaming users.\n\n\t
