abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to
    support\n   some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN connectivity
    and the characteristics provided the\n   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual\n   underlay network which has a customized network
    topology and a set of\n   network resources allocated from the physical network.
    \ A VTN could\n   be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n
    \  The topology of a VTN can be defined using Flex-Algo.  In some\n   network
    scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique Flex-\n   Algo, and the set
    of network resources of the VTN can be instantiated\n   as sub-interfaces or member
    links of the L3 interfaces.  This\n   document describes the mechanisms to build
    the SR based VTNs using SR\n   Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundle with minor extensions.\n\n\t
