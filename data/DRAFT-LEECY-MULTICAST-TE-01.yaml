abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a solution to engineer paths for IP multicast\ntraffic
    in a network, by directing the control messages to setup\nmulticast trees on engineered
    paths. This enables the network\noperator to have control over the topology of
    multicast trees.\nThis proposal partitions the multicast traffic engineering problem\nsuch
    that multicast routing protocols do not have to be modified to\nallocate resources
    for multicast traffic nor do resource allocation\nprotocols such as RSVP or CR-LDP
    have to be able to setup forwarding\nstates (in this case labels) like multicast
    routing protocols.\nResources are allocated on the same trip that paths are selected
    and\nsetup.  This prevent the problem of data being forwarded on branches\nof
    the tree where resources have not being allocated yet. An\nimportant aspect of
    this proposal is that it enables multicast paths\nto be engineered in an aggregatable
    manner, allowing this solution to\nscale in the backbone.\n\t </p>\n      "
