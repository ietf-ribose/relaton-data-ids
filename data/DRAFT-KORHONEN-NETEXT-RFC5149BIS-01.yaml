abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying the mobile node
    or the\n   mobility service subscriber is not enough to distinguish between\n
    \  multiple services possibly provisioned to the said mobile node and\n   its
    mobility service subscription.  A capability to specify different\n   services
    in addition to the mobile node identity can be leveraged to\n   provide flexibility
    for mobility service providers on provisioning\n   multiple services to one mobility
    service subscription.  This\n   document describes a Service Selection Mobility
    Option for both\n   conventional Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 that is intended
    to\n   assist home agents and local mobility agents to make a specific\n   service
    selection for the mobility service subscription during the\n   binding registration
    procedure.  This specification updates RFC5213\n   and obsoletes RFC5149.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
