abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n
    \  improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications
    are protected against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests
    that the existing threat model, while important\n   and still valid, is no longer
    alone sufficient to cater for the\n   pressing security issues in the Internet.
    \ For instance, it is also\n   necessary to protect systems against endpoints
    that are compromised,\n   malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with
    the interests\n   of the users.  While such protection is difficult, there are
    some\n   measures that can be taken.\n\n   It is particularly important to ensure
    that as we continue to develop\n   Internet technology, non-communications security
    related threats are\n   properly understood.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
