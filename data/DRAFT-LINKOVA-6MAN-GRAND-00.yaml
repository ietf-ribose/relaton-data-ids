abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine
    the\n   link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and\n
    \  maintain reachability information.  This document updates [RFC4861]\n   to
    allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a\n   new IPv6
    address is assigned to a host.  It also updates [RFC4862]\n   and [RFC4429] recommending
    hosts to send unsolicited Neighbor\n   Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6
    address.  The proposed\n   change will minimize the delay and packet loss when
    a host initiate\n   connections to off-link destination from a new IPv6 address.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
