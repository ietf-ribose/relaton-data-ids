abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an experimental serverless solution to buildVirtual
    Private LAN Segments (VPLS) for TCP/IP over a multicastenabled IP backbone. IP
    traffic is encapsulated in IPsec [RFC2401]tunnel mode. IP broadcast and multicast
    traffic is sent, afterencapsulation in IPSec tunnel mode, to the VPN assigned
    IP multicastaddress. IP unicast traffic, after encapsulation, is sent directlyto
    the dynamically learned IP tunnel endpoint address. MulticastEnabled ARP (ME-ARP)
    as defined in this document is used todynamically build the mapping between IP
    addresses and remote tunnelendpoints. The tunnel endpoint information is hidden
    in the hardwareaddress given to IP devices in the ARP reply. Therefore IP devicesparticipating
    in a VPLS keep track of the remote locations of otherVPLS members through their
    own ARP table without 'knowledge'.</p>"
