abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals\n
    \  important information about the person who caused the queries, and it\n   would
    be better if eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic.\n   This document describes
    how to use TLS for encrypting DNS traffic\n   between a system acting as a DNS
    stub resolver and a system acting as\n   a DNS recursive resolver.  It provides
    two alternatives that are\n   based on different design goals.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
