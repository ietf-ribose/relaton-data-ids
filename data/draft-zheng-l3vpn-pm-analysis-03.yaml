abstract:
- content: "<p>To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics
    on a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific ingress
    VRF a packet belongs to. But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point network model applies,
    flow identifying is a challenge. This document summarizes the current performance
    monitoring mechanisms for L3VPN in MPLS networks, and analyzes various solutions
    and challenges for measuring performance metrics within these networks. This document
    also identifies various key points which needs to be taken in consideration when
    designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanisms. Performance measurements within
    non-MPLS L3VPN networks is not within the scope of the document.</p>"
