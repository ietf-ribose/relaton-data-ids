abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity
    to the\n   Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process\n
    \  referred to as handover.  Several proposals [5] and [6] were made in\n   order
    to improve the handover delay to support real-time traffic,\n   such as Voice
    over IP.  These proposals keep a fundamental\n   characteristic of Mobile IP,
    namely the handover process is triggered\n   by the Mobile Terminal.  This document
    expands this concept to cover\n   situations where the handover has to be performed
    by network\n   management issues, such as spectrum allocation.  The document\n
    \  describes a control architecture based on the policy management.\n\t </p>\n
