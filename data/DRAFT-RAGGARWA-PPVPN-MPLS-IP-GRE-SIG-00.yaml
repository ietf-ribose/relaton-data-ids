abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a lightweight mechanism for signaling a
    PE \nrouter's capability to encapsulate MPLS using dynamic GRE and/or IP.\nThis
    is applicable when a MPLS packet is tunnelled using a dynamic \nGRE and/or IP
    encapsulation [MPLS-IP-GRE] between PE routers. For \ninstance the MPLS packet
    may be a 2547 based MPLS VPN packet \n[2547bis] or a layer 2 packet transported
    using MPLS [MARTINI]. \nAdding such a mechanism has several benefits. It helps
    in blackhole \navoidance and eases transitioning from MPLS tunneling based \nLayer
    3/Layer 2 VPNs to GRE/IP tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs \n(and vice versa).
    Such a mechanism is needed where a network may be \nusing MPLS and GRE (or IP)
    for tunneling, at the same time, in 2547 \nbased or Layer 2 VPNs. It can help
    in encapsulation selection when \nmultiple tunneling technologies are supported.
    It can also be used to\nenhance the security of the network backbone. \n\t </p>\n
