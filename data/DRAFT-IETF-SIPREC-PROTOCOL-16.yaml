abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of the Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Real Time\n   Protocol
    (RTP) for delivering real-time media and metadata from a\n   Communication Session
    (CS) to a recording device.  The Session\n   Recording Protocol specifies the
    use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to\n   establish a Recording Session (RS) between the
    Session Recording\n   Client (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session
    Recording\n   Server (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only\n
    \  active recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS\n   and
    all participating user agents are notified of the recording.\n   Passive recording,
    where a recording device detects media directly\n   from the network (e.g., using
    port-mirroring techniques), is outside\n   the scope of this document.  In addition,
    lawful intercept is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
