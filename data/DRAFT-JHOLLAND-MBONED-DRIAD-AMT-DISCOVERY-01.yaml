abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new DNS resource record (RR) used to\n
    \  advertise addresses for Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) relays\n   capable
    of receiving multicast traffic from the owner of the RR.  The\n   new AMTRELAY
    RR makes possible a source-specific method for AMT\n   gateways to discover appropriate
    AMT relays, in order to ingest\n   traffic for source-specific multicast channels
    into multicast-capable\n   receiving networks when no multicast connectivity is
    directly\n   available between the sending and receiving networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
