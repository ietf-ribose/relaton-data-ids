abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document is an informative reference discussing strategies
    for\n    using DCCP as the transport protocol for various applications.  The\n
    \   focus is on how applications can make use of the capabilities, and\n    deal
    with the idiosyncrasies, of DCCP.  Of particular interest is how\n    UDP applications,
    which have traditionally ignored congestion control\n    issues, can adapt to
    a congestion controlled transport.\n\t </p>\n      "
