abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Creating and running the 'terminal room' for an IETF meeting istantamount
    to building, running, and dismantling a small computercenter. Although this is
    a well-known area of operations, the uniqueenvironment and its ephemeral nature
    warrant passing on the lore in amildly organized fashion. It is expected that
    this document will beupdated regularly. However, it is not clear that this will
    ever bepublished as an RFC.As the IETF can ill afford failure of this service,
    it is assumedthat the host and organizers have the experience and resources tobuild
    such environments, understand power facilities, cabling, WANand LAN building,
    workstation provisioning, staffing, etc. So thisdocument does not attempt to detail
    how to build computer facilitiesor carry out prudent project management. Rather
    it concentrates onthe unique aspects of the IETF 'terminal room'.</p>"
