    for the evolution of various Internet management technologies and standards such
    as SNMP, COPS, PCIM. This memo has been written in preparation of the IAB network
    management workshop to be help in June 2002. It documents some of the author's
    views and visions and as such it does not even try to be objective.</p>"
