abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Providing an existing scalable authorization infrastructure for
    mobile\nnodes is needed for IPv6-based mobility.  SIM Authentication provides\na
    protocol for authenticating and authorizing services.  It uses an\nauthorizing
    home domain defined by the Subscriber Identity Module\n(SIM). The protocol is
    an Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6\n(ICMPv6) extension.  It can leverage
    the existing SIM authorization\ninfrastructure for automatic bootstrapping of
    security association\nbetween the mobile node and a service, where the service
    can be\ne.g. authorized last-hop VPN setup for network access or Mobile IPv6\nmobile-home
    security association setup.\n\t </p>\n      "
