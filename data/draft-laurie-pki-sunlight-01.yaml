abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public end- entity
    and intermediate TLS certificate issued by a known Certificate Authority recorded
    in one or more certificate logs. In order to detect mis-issuance of certificates,
    all logs are publicly auditable. In particular, domain owners or their agents
    will be able to monitor logs for certificates issued on their own domain. To protect
    clients from unlogged mis-issued certificates, logs sign all recorded certificates,
    and clients can choose not to trust certificates that are not accompanied by an
    appropriate log signature. For privacy and performance reasons log signatures
    are embedded in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization extension [RFC5878],
    or in the certificate itself via an X.509v3 certificate extension [RFC5280]. To
    ensure a globally consistent view of the log, logs also provide a global signature
    over the entire log. Any inconsistency of logs can be detected through cross-checks
    on the global signature. Consistency between any pair of global signatures, corresponding
    to snapshots of the log at different times, can be efficiently shown. Logs are
    only expected to certify that they have seen a certificate, and thus we do not
    specify any revocation mechanism for log signatures in this document. Logs are
    append-only, and log signatures will be valid indefinitely.</p>"
