abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NewSessionTicket record carries a field that tells a client
    the\n   volume of early data that it can include in the 0-RTT messages when\n
    \  reconnecting to the same peer.  There are cases where additional\n   information
    can significantly improve the time-to-service.  This memo\n   discusses a solution
    where path adaptation parameters are also shared\n   between the peers.  There
    are use cases where this can accelerate the\n   throughput of subsequent 0-RTT
    connections in both direction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
