abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are number of deployment scenarios where there is a need
    for a\n   home agent to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple\n   mobile
    nodes that it is serving.  A service provider hosting home\n   agent service for
    enterprises, or for supporting some of the IPv6\n   transitioning solutions related
    to IPv4 address exhaust problem, a\n   home agent may have to allocate the same
    private IPv4 address to\n   multiple mobile nodes.  The Dual-stack Mobile IPv6
    does not have such\n   support.  This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack
    Mobile\n   IPv6 for supporting overlapping private IPv4 address assignment\n   support.\n\n\t
