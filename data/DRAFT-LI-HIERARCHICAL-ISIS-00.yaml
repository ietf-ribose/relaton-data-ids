abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IS-IS routing protocol was originally defined with a two
    level\n   hierarchical structure.  This was adequate for the networks at the\n
    \  time.  As we continue to expand the scale of our networks, it is\n   apparent
    that additional hierarchy would be a welcome degree of\n   flexibility in network
    design.\n\n   This document defines IS-IS Levels 3 through 8.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
