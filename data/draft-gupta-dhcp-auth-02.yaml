abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo proposes a new protocol for DHCP authentication within thegeneral
    framework outlined in RFC 3118 [4]. This protocol usespublic-key cryptography,
    in the form of digital signatures, forauthentication. This simplifies key management
    and supports mutualauthentication between clients and servers belonging to differentadministrative
    domains.</p>"
