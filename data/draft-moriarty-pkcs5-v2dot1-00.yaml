abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides recommendations for the implementation of password-based
    cryptography, covering key derivation functions, encryption schemes, message-authentication
    schemes, and ASN.1 syntax identifying the techniques. The recommendations are
    intended for general application within computer and communications systems, and
    as such include a fair amount of flexibility. They are particularly intended for
    the protection of sensitive information such as private keys, as in PKCS #8. It
    is expected that application standards and implementation profiles based on these
    specifications may include additional constraints. Other cryptographic techniques
    based on passwords, such as password- based-key entity authentication and key
    establishment protocols are outside the scope of this document. Guidelines for
    the selection of passwords are also outside the scope. This document represents
    a republication of PKCS #5 v2.1 from RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography
    Standards (PKCS) series. By publishing this RFC, change control is transferred
    to the IETF.</p>"
