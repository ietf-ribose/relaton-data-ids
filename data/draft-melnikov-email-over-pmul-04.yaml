abstract:
- content: "<p>ACP 142 defines P_MUL, which is a protocol for reliable multicast in
    bandwidth constrained and delayed acknowledgement (EMCON) environments running
    over UDP. This document is a specification of the basic protocol for electronic
    mail transfer over P_MUL. It also describes how to gateway this basic protocol
    to/from Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC 5321), including some common SMTP extensions.</p>"
