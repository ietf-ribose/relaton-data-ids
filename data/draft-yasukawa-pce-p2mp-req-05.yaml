abstract:
  content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computationfunctions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol LabelSwitching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and
    routing protocols havebeen made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
    Engineered(TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The use of PCE in MPLS networks isalready
    established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimescomplex to compute, it
    is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs.Generic requirements for a communication
    protocol between PathComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PathComputation
    Element (PCE) Communication Protocol GenericRequirements". This document complements
    the generic requirements andpresents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocolrequirements
    for point-to-multipoint MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering.</p>
