abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Forces-IPTML protocol that is designed
    to\n   complement ForCES-PL (ForCES Protocol Layer) for communicating\n   between
    Forwarding and Control Elements that make up a\n   ForCEs-compliant network element,
    using IP transport technology (e.g.\n   TCP/IP, SCTP/IP, UDP/IP).  This protocol
    addresses all the\n   requirements described in the Forces [0] requirements document.
    \ This\n   document also specifies architectural attributes necessary in an\n
    \  implementation of Forces-IPTML to ensure correct and secure protocol\n   operation.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
