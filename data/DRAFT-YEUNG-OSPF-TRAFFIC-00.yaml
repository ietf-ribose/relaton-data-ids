abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes extensions to the OSPF protocol to
    support\n   Traffic Engineering [1].  The OSPF protocol is specified in [2], This\n
    \  extension make use of opaque LSA defined in [3] and provides similar\n   information
    to what is defined in the ISIS extensions for traffic\n   engineering[4].\n\n
    \  This document extends the OSPF protocol by specifying new information\n   that
    a router can place in a type 10 opaque Link State Advertisement\n   (LSA). This
    information describes additional information about the\n   state of the network
    that is useful for traffic engineering.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
