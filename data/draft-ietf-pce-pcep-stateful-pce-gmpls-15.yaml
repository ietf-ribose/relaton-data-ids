abstract:
  content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering
    (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer
    networks. The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) has been extended to support stateful
    PCE functions where the PCE retains information about the paths already present
    in the network, but those extensions are technology-agnostic. This memo provides
    extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability
    in GMPLS-controlled networks.</p>"
