abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) specifies a control message set for
    nodes to discover neighbors, routers, prefixes and other services on the link.
    It also supports a manner of StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC). The
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specifies a service for
    the stateful delegation of addresses and prefixes. Currently, at least two round-trip
    message exchanges are necessary in order to perform the IPv6ND router discovery
    and DHCPv6 address/ prefix delegation functions. This document presents a protocol
    for combining these two round trips into a single round trip by joining the two
    services into a single unified service.</p>"
