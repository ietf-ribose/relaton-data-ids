abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for a Multicast-friendly Internet
    eXchange (MIX), and the actual implementation at the NASA Ames Research Center
    Federal Internet eXchange (FIX-West, or FIX). The MIX has three objectives: native
    IP multicast routing, scalable interdomain policy-based route exchange, and to
    allow a variety of IGP protocols and topologies for intra-domain use. In support
    of these objectives, the MIX architecture defines the following components: a
    peer-peer routing protocol, a method for multicast forwarding, a method for exchanging
    information about active sources, and a medium which provides native multicast.
    This document describes the protocols and configurations necessary to provide
    a current, working multicast-friendly internet exchange, or MIX. This memo is
    a product of the MBONE Deployment Working Group (MBONED) in the Operations and
    Management Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Submit comments to &lt;mboned@ns.uoregon.edu
    or the authors.</p>"
