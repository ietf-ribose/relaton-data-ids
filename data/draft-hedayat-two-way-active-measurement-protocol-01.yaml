abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPPM One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] provides a common
    protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network devices. OWAMP [OWAMP]
    can be used in both directions independently to measure one-way metrics in both
    directions between two network elements. However, it does not accommodate round-trip
    or two-way measurements. This draft proposes a Two-way Active Measurement Protocol,
    based on the One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP], that will accommodate
    two-way or round-trip measurements.</p>"
