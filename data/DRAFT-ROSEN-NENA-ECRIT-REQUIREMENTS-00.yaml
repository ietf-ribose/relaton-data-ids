abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The National Emergency Number Association (NENA)'s mission
    is to\n   foster the technological advancement, availability, and\n   implementation
    of a universal emergency telephone number system in\n   North America.  NENA has
    an active effort to develop a new\n   architecture for emergency call handling
    known as 'i3' being\n   developed in its Long Term Definition working group.  The
    following\n   requirements are a subset of the requirements of the i3 work which\n
    \  relate to ecrit work.  NENA understands the global nature of the\n   Internet,
    and is eager to work with the IETF to ensure that emergency\n   call processing
    meets the needs of users in North America.\n\t </p>\n      "
