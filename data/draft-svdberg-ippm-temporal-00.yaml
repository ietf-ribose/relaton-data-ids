abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo intends to define metrics that allow to aggregate metric
    samples over a time interval. Metrics that are identical in type and scope but
    collected at different times, or in different time windows, can be aggregated
    into a new metric that characterizes the full time interval. The document additionally
    introduces some comments on terminology and motivation that could be the basis
    for a more general framework for metric composition.</p>"
