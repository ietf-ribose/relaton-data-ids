abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, the Request for Comments (RFC) moniker applies to
    all\n   documents that are published by the RFC editor.  This includes\n   documents
    produced by IETF processes, such as IAB documents or\n   working group standards,
    on an equal footing with individual\n   contributions to the RFC editor.  As a
    result, the term RFC does not\n   mean that a document has been produced by the
    IETF (though some\n   non-IETF RFCs strongly resemble IETF RFCs).  This is at
    odds with the\n   understanding of the commons, which has come to view RFCs as
    the\n   output document series of the IETF.  This document discusses the\n   importance
    of aligning fact with this common understanding, and\n   proposes that the name
    RFC be associated only with IETF documents.\n\t </p>\n      "
