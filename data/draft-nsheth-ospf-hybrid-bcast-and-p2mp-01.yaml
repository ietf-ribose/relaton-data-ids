abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as
    ahybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes ofOSPF operation.
    Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as LSAdatabase synchronization are
    performed using the broadcast model, butthe network is represented using the point-to-multipoint
    model in therouter LSAs of the routers connected to it. This allows an accuraterepresentation
    of the cost of communication between different routerson the network, while maintaining
    the network efficiency of broadcastoperation. This approach is relatively simple
    and requires minimalchanges to OSPF.</p>"
