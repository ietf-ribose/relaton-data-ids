abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip\n
    \  times to the closest DNS root server.  Some DNS recursive resolver\n   operators
    want to prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root\n   servers by third parties.
    \ Such resolvers can greatly decrease the\n   round-trip time and prevent observation
    of requests by running a copy\n   of the full root zone on a loopback address
    (such as 127.0.0.1).\n   This document shows how to start and maintain such a
    copy of the root\n   zone that does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS,
    at the\n   cost of adding some operational fragility for the operator.\n\n   This
    draft will update RFC 7706.  See Section 1.1 for a list of\n   topics that will
    be added in the update.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background\n   information, answers to freqently asked questions, general musings,\n
    \  etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n   [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.
    \ The most recent\n   version of the document, open issues, etc should all be
    available\n   here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t </p>\n
