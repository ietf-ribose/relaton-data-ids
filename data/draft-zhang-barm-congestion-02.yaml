abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Binomial congestion control At Receivers for
    Multicast (BARM). BARM is a single rate multicast congestion control protocol
    for streaming media applications in the best effort Internet environment. Combining
    aspects of window-based and rate-based congestion control, the protocol shifts
    most of the congestion control mechanisms to multicast receivers. A congestion
    window is maintained and updated by each receiver independently according to TCP-friendly
    binomial algorithm, and is converted to the expected sending rate which is then
    fed back to the sender if permitted. To suppress feedback implosion, a representative
    receiver is selected among receivers and a distributed suppression mechanism is
    used. BARM has good TCP-friendliness, smoothness, scalability, and acceptable
    responsiveness.</p>"
