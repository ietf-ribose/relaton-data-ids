abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With Wi-Fi emerging as a trusted access network for service\n
    \  providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly\n   available
    in 3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well.\n   Such functions include
    Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple\n   Packet Data Network (PDN) connections,
    and seamless mobility between\n   Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.\n\n   The EAP/AKA
    (and EAP/AKA') protocol is required for mobile devices to\n   access the mobile
    Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via trusted Wi-Fi\n   networks.  This document defines
    a few new EAP attributes to enable\n   the above-mentioned functions in trusted
    Wi-Fi access networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
