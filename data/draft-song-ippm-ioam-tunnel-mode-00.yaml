abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the In-situ OAM (iOAM) processing behavior
    in a network with tunnels. Specifically, the iOAM processing in tunnels with the
    uniform model and the pipe model is discussed. The procedure is applicable to
    different type of tunnel protocols.</p>"
