abstract:
  content: "<p>This document revises the RFC 3775 rules on how Alternate Care-ofAddress
    option is processed. Alternate Care-of Address option isused to carry the current
    care-of address inside a Mobility Headermessage. This is used in addition to the
    source address in thepacket in order to ensure that the care-of address is protected
    byIPsec ESP, the security mechanism that protects Mobility Headermessages. Unfortunately,
    RFC 3775 did not require verification thatthe source address and care-of address
    are the same. This documentadds that requirement.</p>"
