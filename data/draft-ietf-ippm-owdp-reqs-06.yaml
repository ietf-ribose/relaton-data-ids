abstract:
- content: "<p>With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it
    becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high
    precision. To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements
    is required. This document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement
    protocol (OWAMP) standard. The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as
    other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
