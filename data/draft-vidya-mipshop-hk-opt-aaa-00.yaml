abstract:
  content: "\t <t>AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a sharedkey
    using a AAA server. To ensure that the round trip to the AAAserver does not delay
    handoff, the handover key must be derivedindependent of and well ahead of the
    actual handoff, preferablyimmediately after moving to a new access router. This
    documentdescribes one such method of optimizing the handover key derivationby
    using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR haveestablished a
    security association.</p>"
