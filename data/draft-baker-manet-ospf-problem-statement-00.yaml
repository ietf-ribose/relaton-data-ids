abstract:
- content: "<p>In ad hoc networks containing or contained within larger IP networks,
    many of the capabilities of a routing protocol such as OSPF are desirable. This
    document poses the issues that need to be addressed to make OSPF work well in
    a network containing both traditional LANs and WANs and also radio network topologies.</p>"
