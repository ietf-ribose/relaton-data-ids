abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the RTP payload format for the Tactical\n
    \  Secure Voice Cryptographic Interoperability Specification (TSVCIS)\n   speech
    coder.  TSVCIS is a scalable narrowband voice coder supporting\n   varying encoder
    data rates and fallbacks.  It is implemented as an\n   augmentation to the Mixed
    Excitation Linear Prediction Enhanced\n   (MELPe) speech coder by conveying additional
    speech coder parameters\n   for enhancing voice quality.  TSVCIS augmented speech
    data is\n   processed in conjunction with its temporal matched MELP 2400 speech\n
    \  data.  The RTP packetization of TSVCIS and MELPe speech coder data is\n   described
    in detail.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
