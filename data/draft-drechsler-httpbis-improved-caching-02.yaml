abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an improved HTTP caching method which can be
    applied in addition to the standard caching behavior described in [Part6]. It
    defines the associated header field that controls this improved caching mechanism
    and a modified caching operation which is slightly different to one in [Part6].</p>"
