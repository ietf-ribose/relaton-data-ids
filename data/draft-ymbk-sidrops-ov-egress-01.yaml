abstract:
- content: "<p>A BGP speaker may perform RPKI origin validation not only on routes
    received from BGP neighbors and routes that are redistributed from other routing
    protocols, but also on routes it sends to BGP neighbors. For egress policy, it
    is important that the classification uses the effective origin AS of the processed
    route, which may specifically be altered by the commonly available knobs such
    as removing private ASs, confederation handling, and other modifications of the
    origin AS.</p>"
