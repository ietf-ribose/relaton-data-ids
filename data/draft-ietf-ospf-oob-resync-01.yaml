abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IPnetworks.
    LSDB synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods--initial LSDB synchronization
    when an OSPF router has just beenconnected to the network and asynchronous flooding
    that ensurescontinuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changesafter
    the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime benecessary for OSPF routers
    to resynchronize their LSDBs. OSPFstandard, however, does not allow routers to
    do so without actuallychanging the topology view of the network. This memo describes
    amechanism to perform such form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.</p>"
