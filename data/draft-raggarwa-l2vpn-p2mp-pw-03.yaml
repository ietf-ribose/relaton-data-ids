abstract:
  content: <p>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism thatemulates
    the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MPTelecommunications service such
    as P2MP ATM over a Packet SwitchedNetwork (PSN). One of the applicabilities of
    a P2MP PW is to delivera Layer 2 multicast service, that carries multicast frames
    (encodedusing Layer 2 or IP mechanisms) from a multicast source to one ormore
    multicast receivers.[RFC4664] describes a number of different ways in which sets
    of PWsmay be combined together into "Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs" (L2PPVPNs,
    or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds ofL2VPN. P2MP PWs enable
    a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private MulticastService (VPMS), which may be in
    addition to the Virtual Private WireService (VPWS) offered by the L2VPN. A VPMS
    is a L2VPN service thatprovides point-to-multipoint connectivity traffic to customers.VPMS
    framework and requirements are described in [VPLS-REQ]. One ofthe VPMS requirements
    is auto-discovery. This document describes howprocedures outlined in [VPLS-MCAST]
    can be used for auto-discovery(A-D) in VPMS using BGP. This document also describes
    BGP basedprocedures for P2MP PW signaling for VPMS that may be used when BGPis
    used for VPMS auto-discovery.</p>
