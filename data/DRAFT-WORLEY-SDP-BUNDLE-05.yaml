abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session\n
    \  Description Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number\n   of
    media descriptions (\"m= lines\") are multiplexed and transmitted\n   over a single
    transport association.  The transport association is\n   described by an additional
    media description, allowing SDP attributes\n   to be applied to the aggregate,
    independently of attributes applied\n   to the constituents.  In offer/answer
    usage, the bundle mechanism is\n   backward compatible with SDP processors that
    do not understand the\n   mechanism.  The mechanism is designed to be compatible
    with the\n   limitations of the existing Internet infrastructure.\n\n\t </p>\n
