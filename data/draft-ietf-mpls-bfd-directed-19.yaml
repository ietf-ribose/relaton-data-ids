abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to be able to
    monitor a wide variety of encapsulations of paths between systems. When a BFD
    session monitors an explicitly routed unidirectional path there may be a need
    to direct egress BFD peer to use a specific path for the reverse direction of
    the BFD session.</p>"
