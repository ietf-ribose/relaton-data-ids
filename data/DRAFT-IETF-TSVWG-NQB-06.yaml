abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a
    Non-\n   Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The purpose of this NQB\n
    \  PHB is to provide a separate queue that enables smooth, low-data-\n   rate,
    application-limited traffic flows, which would ordinarily share\n   a queue with
    bursty and capacity-seeking traffic, to avoid the\n   latency, latency variation
    and loss caused by such traffic.  This PHB\n   is implemented without prioritization
    and without rate policing,\n   making it suitable for environments where the use
    of either these\n   features may be restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed
    primarily\n   for use by access network segments, where queuing delays and queuing\n
    \  loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but its use\n   is
    not limited to such segments.  In particular, applications to\n   cable broadband
    links, Wi-Fi links, and mobile network radio and core\n   segments are discussed.
    \ This document recommends a specific\n   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    to identify Non-Queue-\n   Building flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
