abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams\nto
    a mobile host.  The protocol is intended to provide local mobility\nand handoff
    support.  It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide\nwide area mobility support.
    \ Four fundamental design principles of\nthe protocol are: (1) location information
    is stored in distributed\ndata bases (2) location information referring to a mobile
    host is\ncreated and updated by regular IP datagrams originated by the said\nmobile
    host (3) location information is stored as soft state (4)\n   location management
    for idle mobile hosts is separated from location\n   management of hosts that
    are actively transmitting or receiving data.\n\t </p>\n      "
