abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of\n\"Unwanted
    Internet Traffic\".  The report from that workshop is\ndocumented in RFC 4948
    [RFC4948].  Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for\n\"[t]ightening the security of
    the core routing infrastructure.\"  Four\nmain steps were identified for improving
    the security of the routing\ninfrastructure.  One of those steps was \"securing
    the routing\nprotocols' packets on the wire.\"  One mechanism for securing routing\nprotocol
    packets on the wire is the use of per-packet cryptographic\nmessage authentication,
    providing both peer authentication and\nmessage integrity.  Many different routing
    protocols exist and they\nemploy a range of different transport subsystems.  Therefore
    there\nmust necessarily be various methods defined for applying\ncryptographic
    authentication to these varying protocols.  Many\nrouting protocols already have
    some method for accomplishing\ncryptographic message authentication.  However,
    in many cases the\nexisting methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or employ\ncryptographic
    algorithms that have been deprecated.  This document is\none of a series concerned
    with defining a roadmap of protocol\nspecification work for the use of modern
    cryptogrpahic mechanisms and\nalgorithms for message authentication in routing
    protocols.  In\nparticular, it defines the framework for a key management protocol\nthat
    may be used to create and manage session keys for message\nauthentication and
    integrity.  The overall roadmap reflects the input\nof both the security area
    and routing area in order to form a jointly\nagreed upon and prioritized work
    list for the effort.\n\t </p>\n      "
