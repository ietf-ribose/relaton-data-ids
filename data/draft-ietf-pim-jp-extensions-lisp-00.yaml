abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to PIM Receiver RLOC Join/ Prune
    attribute that supports the construction of multicast distribution trees where
    the root and receivers are located in different Locator/ ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) sites and are connected using underlay IP Multicast. This attribute allows
    the receiver site to signal the underlay multicast group to the control plane
    of the root ITR (Ingress Tunnel Router).</p>"
