abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and\n
    \  provisioning of symmetric keys (for example One Time Password (OTP)\n   shared
    secrets or symmetric cryptographic keys) to different types of\n   crypto modules
    such as a strong authentication device.  The standard\n   key transport format
    enables enterprises to deploy best-of-breed\n   solutions combining components
    from different vendors into the same\n   infrastructure.\n\n   This work is based
    on earlier work by the members of OATH (Initiative\n   for Open AuTHentication)
    to specify a format that can be freely\n   distributed to the technical community.
    \ The authors believe that a\n   common and shared specification will facilitate
    adoption of two-\n   factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability\n
    \  between commercial and open-source implementations.\n\t </p>\n      "
