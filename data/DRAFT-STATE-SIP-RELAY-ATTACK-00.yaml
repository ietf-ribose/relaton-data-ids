abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [RFC3261]) provides a
    mechanism\n   for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more\n
    \  participants.  This document describes a vulnerability of SIP\n   combined
    with HTTP Digest Access Authentication [RFC2617] through\n   which an attacker
    can leverage the victim's credentials to send\n   authenticated requests on his
    behalf.  This attack is different from\n   the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack
    and does not require any\n   eavesdropping, DNS or IP spoofing.\n\t </p>\n      "
