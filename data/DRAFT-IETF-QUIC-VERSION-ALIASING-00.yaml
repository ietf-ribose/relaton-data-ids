abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its
    future\n   extensibility partly by specifying its version number.  There will
    be\n   a relatively small number of published version numbers for the\n   foreseeable
    future.  This document provides a method for clients and\n   servers to negotiate
    the use of other version numbers in subsequent\n   connections.  If a sizeable
    subset of QUIC connections use this\n   mechanism, this should prevent middlebox
    ossification around the\n   current set of published version numbers and the contents
    of QUIC\n   Initial packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
