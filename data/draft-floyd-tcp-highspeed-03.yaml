abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP'scongestion
    control mechanism for use with TCP connections withlarge congestion windows. The
    congestion control mechanismsof the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion
    windowsthat can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. Forexample, for
    a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packetsand a 100 ms round-trip time,
    achieving a steady-statethroughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestionwindow
    of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at mostone congestion event every
    5,000,000,000 packets (orequivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3
    hours).This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. Toaddress this
    limitation of TCP, this document proposesHighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation
    and feedback fromthe wider community.</p>"
