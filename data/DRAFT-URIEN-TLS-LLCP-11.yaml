abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the support of the TLS protocol over
    the NFC\n   (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol)\n
    \  layer, which is referred as LLCPS. The NFC peer to peer (P2P)\n   protocol
    may be used by any application that needs communication\n   between two devices
    at very small distances (a few centimeters).\n   LLCPS enforces a strong security
    in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be\n   deployed for many services, in the Internet
    of Things (IoT)\n   ecosystem, such as payments, access control or ticketing operations.\n
    \  Applications secured by LLCPS are identified by the service name\n   \"urn:nfc:sn:tls:service\".\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
