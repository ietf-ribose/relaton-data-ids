abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document specifies information encoded in BGP UPDATE for\n
    \  advertising WAN ports properties of a SDWAN edge node to its\n   controller.
    SDWAN edge node's WAN ports may face untrusted networks,\n   such as the public
    internet, may get assigned IP addresses from the\n   Internet Service Providers
    (ISPs), may get assigned dynamic IP\n   addresses via DHCP, or may have private
    addresses (e.g. inside third\n   party Cloud DCs). Packets forwarded through those
    SDWAN WAN ports\n   might need to be encrypted (depending on the user policies)
    or need\n   to go through NAT. SDWAN edge nodes need to propagate those WAN\n
    \  ports properties to its controller which in turn distribute to the\n   peers
    who are authorized to communicate across different types of\n   underlay networks
    including the untrusted networks.\n\n   This document assumes the BGP Route Reflectors
    (RR) as the\n   controller, i.e. SDWAN edges send the WAN ports properties encoded\n
    \  in BGP UPDATE to the RR which in turns propagate the information to\n   a group
    of authorized SDWAN edges reachable via overlay networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
