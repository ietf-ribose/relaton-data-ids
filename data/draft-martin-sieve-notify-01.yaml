abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible
    thatthey have received new mail. Most of these methods involve pollingto check
    for new messages periodically. A push method handled by thefinal delivery agent
    gives users quicker notifications and savesserver resources. This document does
    not specify the notificationmethod but is expected that using existing instant
    messaginginfrastructure such as Zephyr, ICQ, or SMS messages will be popular.This
    draft describes an extension to the Sieve mail filteringlanguage that allows users
    to give specific preferences fornotification of Sieve actions.</p>"
