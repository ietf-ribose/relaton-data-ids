abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the use of HMAC-only cipher suites for
    TLS 1.3,\n   which provides server and optionally mutual authentication and data\n
    \  authenticity, but not data confidentiality.  Cipher suites with these\n   properties
    are not of general applicability, but there are use cases,\n   specifically in
    Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained\n   environments, that do not require
    confidentiality of exchanged\n   messages while still requiring integrity protection,
    server\n   authentication, and optional client authentication.  This document\n
    \  gives examples of such use cases, with the caveat that prior to using\n   these
    integrity-only cipher suites, a threat model for the situation\n   at hand is
    needed, and a threat analysis must be performed within\n   that model to determine
    whether the use of integrity-only cipher\n   suites is appropriate.  The approach
    described in this document is\n   not endorsed by the IETF and does not have IETF
    consensus, but is\n   presented here to enable interoperable implementation of
    a reduced\n   security mechanism that provides authentication and message integrity\n
    \  without supporting confidentiality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
