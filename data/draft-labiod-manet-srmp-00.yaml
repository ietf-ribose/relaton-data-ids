abstract:
- content: "<p>The Source Routing-based Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is designed to provide
    multicast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It applies the source routing
    mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [1] in a modified manner
    decreasing the size of the packet header. SRMP obtains multicast routes on-demand
    through constructing a mesh (an arbitrary subnet) to connect group members providing
    robustness against mobility.</p>"
