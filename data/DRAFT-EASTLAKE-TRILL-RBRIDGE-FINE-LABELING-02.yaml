abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has standardized RBridges (Routing Bridges), devices
    that\n   implement the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol, a standard for least cost transparent frame routing in\n   multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topologies, using link-state\n   routing and encapsulation
    with a hop count.\n\n   The TRILL base protocol standard supports up to 4K VLAN
    IDs (Virtual\n   Local Area Network IDentifiers). However, there are applications
    that\n   require more fine-grained labeling of data and end stations. This\n   document
    updates RFC 6325 by specifying extensions to the TRILL\n   protocol to accomplish
    this.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
