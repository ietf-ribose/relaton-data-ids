abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an experimental protocol for opportunistic
    TLS\n   security based on the DANE TLSA PKI.  The design goal is an\n   incremental
    transition of the Internet email backbone (MTA to MTA\n   SMTP traffic) from today's
    unauthenticated and typically unencrypted\n   connections to TLS encrypted and
    authenticated delivery when the\n   client is DANE TLSA aware and the server domain
    publishes DANE TLSA\n   records for its MX hosts.  This protocol has been implemented
    by\n   author in the Postfix MTA.  It is hoped that other MTA\n   implementations
    will find this protocol well suited to their needs\n   and will adopt interoperable
    implementations.  This protocol may be\n   suited to other use-cases for opportunistic
    TLS beyond SMTP, but such\n   use-cases are not covered here, and will need to
    be defined in\n   separate specifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
