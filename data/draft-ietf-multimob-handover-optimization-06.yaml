abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental multicast handover optimization
    mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic
    to mobile nodes after handovers. The mechanism is based on speeding up the acquisition
    of mobile nodes' multicast context by the mobile access gateways. To do that,
    extensions to the current Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol are proposed. These extensions
    are not only applicable to the base solution for multicast support in Proxy Mobile
    IPv6, but they can also be applied to other solutions developed to avoid the tunnel
    convergence problem. Furthermore, these extensions are also independent of the
    role played by the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (either
    acting as multicast listener discovery proxy or multicast router).</p>"
