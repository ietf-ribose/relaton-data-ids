abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling
    for \nresources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The \nrequirements
    for such signaling are being developed in [2] and a \nframework in [3]. The framework
    describes a 2-layer protocol \narchitecture, with a common lower NSIS 'transport'
    layer protocol \n(NTLP) supporting a variety of upper layer NSIS signaling layer
    \nprotocols (NSLPs). \nIt is an open issue where within this architecture to place
    the \nresponsibility for handling overload conditions. These conditions \nrelate
    both to overload of the IP layer itself, as well as overload \nof buffer/processing
    resources within the NTLP/NSLPs. This note \ndiscusses the requirements and the
    implications of various \napproaches, and proposes a way forwards. \n\t </p>\n
