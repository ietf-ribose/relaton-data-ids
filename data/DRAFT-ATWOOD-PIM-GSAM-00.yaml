abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Group Security Association Management\n
    \  (GSAM) protocol, which manages the IPsec Group Security Associations\n   that
    are used to protect some packets of Secure IGMP (SIGMP) and\n   Secure MLD (SMLD).
    \ In GSAM, one router is elected as the group\n   controller / key server to create
    group security associations for all\n   the interesting secure groups and distribute
    them to authorized users\n   and other routers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
