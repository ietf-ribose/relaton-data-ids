abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper was necessitated by an overwhelming desire. An attempt
    to\nend the disparity in the dissemination of information which is absent\nof
    the logical and thoroughness in rendering an explanation of the IP\nAddressing
    Scheme. To render a more pointed fact, I needed to pass a\nCISCO Certification
    Examination. However, this can never be\naccomplished, if the information that
    is needed and used in the\npreparation thereof, lacks continuity and propagates
    errors pertaining\nto foundational information. That is,as a direct result of
    this\nundertaking, I corrected  the underlining errors, derived a possible\nalternative
    approach to the IPv4 Addressing Scheme, and expanded its\nClass system ( that
    is no longer in use ). In other words, I was\nindeed successful in the elimination
    of the problems associated with\nIP Address Flooding inherent in IPv4 and the
    complexities of IPv6.\nIn short, small business and single family dwellings can
    now have the\noption of having their own private IP Addressing Scheme, without
    the\ndisparity resulting from the steep learning curve presented in IPv6.\nWhile
    the Internet Community at large, will not suffer a shortage of\nthe availability
    IP Addresses for assigned distribution. Especially\nsince, while the number available
    IP Addresses do not exceed the\namount reported to be provided, if IPv6 is implemented.
    It does\nindeed, provide enough IP Addresses to cover their continued issuance\nfor
    at least another 100 years or so. Which is dependent upon the\nadoption of an
    adequate scheme for its allocation and distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
