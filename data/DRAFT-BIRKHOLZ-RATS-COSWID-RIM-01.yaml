abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Concise Software Identification (CoSWID) tags identify and
    describe\n   individual software components, patches, and installation bundles.\n
    \  CoSWID is based on ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 2:2015 that provides a\n   complementary
    XML schema definition (XSD) for Software Identification\n   (SWID) tags.  CoSWID
    supports the same features as the corresponding\n   XML SWID tags.  The CoSWID
    specification also includes more\n   structured extensibility features and reduces
    a few of ambiguities\n   that are not explicitly resolved in the ISO XSD.  In
    this document,\n   these extensibility features (extension points) are used to
    add\n   attributes to the CoSWID specification.  The new attributes allow for\n
    \  the use of CoSWID as Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM).  There\n   are
    four sets of RIM features defined in this specification. 1.)\n   attributes that
    support RIM manifests for Measured Boot, 2.)\n   attributes that support package
    manager managed structures, 3.)\n   attributes that allow for OID to be used in
    the description of\n   Reference Integrity Measurements, and 4.) attributes for
    object trees\n   in support of Target Environments that are chained via Layered\n
    \  Attestation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
