abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an update of the Internet Protocol version
    6\n   (IPv6) specification (RFC2460) to improve the performance in the use\n   case
    where a tunnel protocol uses UDP with IPv6 to tunnel packets.\n   The performance
    improvement is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP\n   checksum requirement for
    any suitable tunnel protocol where header\n   information is protected on the
    \"inner\" packet being carried.  This\n   relaxation removes the overhead associated
    with the computation of\n   UDP checksums on IPv6 packets used to carry tunnel
    protocols.  The\n   specification describes how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement
    can be\n   relaxed for the situation where the encapsulated packet itself\n   contains
    a checksum.  The limitations and risks of this approach are\n   described, and
    restrictions specified on the use of the method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
