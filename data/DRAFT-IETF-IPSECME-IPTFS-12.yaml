abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism for aggregation and fragmentation\n
    \  of IP packets when they are being encapsulated in ESP payload.  This\n   new
    payload type can be used for various purposes such as decreasing\n   encapsulation
    overhead for small IP packets; however, the focus in\n   this document is to enhance
    IPsec traffic flow security (IP-TFS) by\n   adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality
    (TFC) to encrypted IP\n   encapsulated traffic.  TFC is provided by obscuring
    the size and\n   frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-sized, constant-send-rate
    IPsec\n   tunnel.  The solution allows for congestion control as well as non-\n
    \  constant send-rate usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
