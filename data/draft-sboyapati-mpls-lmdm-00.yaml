abstract:
  content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can
    carryany data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision
    newservice with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications such as
    Voice and Video arerunning on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in packet transmission
    and delivery. So Voice and Video trafficon MPLS network needs low loss and delay
    LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets.This draft is proposing a solution to
    selection of Low loss and latency LSP's forVoice and Video applications using
    MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters.The benefit of this technology results
    in delivery voice and video packets withbest possible lsp i.e. LSP's with less
    loss and delay.</p>"
