abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can
    carry any data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to
    provision new service with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications
    such as Voice and Video are running on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in
    packet transmission and delivery. So Voice and Video traffic on MPLS network needs
    low loss and delay LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets. This draft is proposing
    a solution to selection of Low loss and latency LSP's for Voice and Video applications
    using MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters. The benefit of this technology
    results in delivery voice and video packets with best possible lsp i.e. LSP's
    with less loss and delay.</p>"
