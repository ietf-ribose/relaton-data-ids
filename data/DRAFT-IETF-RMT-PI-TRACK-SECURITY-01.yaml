abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the security issues within the TRee-based
    \nACKnowledgement (TRACK) reliable multicast protocol instantiation, and \nidentifies
    some constraints and requirements for security provisions for \nthis protocol.
    \ Based on the constraints and requirements, the document \nproposes a separation
    of data packet confidentiality and authentication, \nfrom transport layer protection.
    \ It proposes that TRACK be primarily \nconcerned with group authentication of
    control and data packets, to \nprotect against attacks on the transport infrastructure.
    \ It proposes \nthat data confidentiality and source authentication be provided
    \nseparately from this low level group authentication, ideally at the \napplication
    level.  We show that this is particularly important for \nTRACK, because of the
    requirement that the interior control nodes only \nOPTIONALLY have access to the
    data packet payload.\n\t </p>\n      "
