abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) requires certain
    key information fields be made available to facilitate path computation and the
    establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The information model described
    in \"Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model for Wavelength Switched
    Optical Networks\" (RFC 7446) shows what information is required at specific points
    in the WSON. Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of
    general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are specific to
    WSONs.\n\n This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the
    WSON-specific information fields. It is intended that protocol- specific documents
    will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses.
    Such encodings can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In
    addition, these encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same
    information to a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\t </p>\n      "
