abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides
    the\nsupport of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. The\npurpose
    of SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol to convey\nSCCP messages over
    an IP based network. The core part of the SSTP\narchitecture is the specification
    of the SSTP (Simple SCCP Tunneling\nProtocol) adaptation layer, that provides
    adaptation between the SCCP\nlayer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP
    family protocols IP,\nUDP, TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages.
    TCP is\nused for SCCP class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives and\nparameters
    to SCCP than MTP, and provides seamless connection between\nnodes implementing
    SSTP and classical SS7 nodes by means of a SSTP\ngateway. The design of SSTP is
    oriented to fulfill the requirements of\nTCAP user applications running on a WAN.\n\n\t
