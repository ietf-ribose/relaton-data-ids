abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture of the I2NSF framework using
    security function chaining for security policy enforcement. Security function
    chaining enables composite inspection of network traffic by steering the traffic
    through multiple types of network security functions according to the information
    model for NSFs capabilities in the I2NSF framework. This document explains the
    additional components integrated into the I2NSF framework and their functionalities
    to achieve security function chaining. It also describes representative use cases
    to address major benefits from the proposed architecture.</p>"
