abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers
    ofIP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP. StreamingControl Transport
    Protocol is new generation IP transport protocolwhich has been published in RFC2960
    and updated by RFC4960. SCTP canmaintain association among multiple peers, thus
    supports multiplehoming and multiple streaming, while inherits most functions
    of TCP.SCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling orpossible
    user plane data in turbulence network which needs to savespectrum resource by
    compressing IP headers.</p>"
