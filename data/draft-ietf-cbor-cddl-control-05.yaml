abstract:
- content: '<p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. The present
    document defines a number of control operators that did not make it into RFC 8610:
    ".plus", ".cat" and ".det" for the construction of constants, ".abnf"/".abnfb"
    for including ABNF (RFC 5234/RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications, and ".feature"
    for indicating the use of a non-basic feature in an instance.</p>'
