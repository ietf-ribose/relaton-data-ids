abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new approach intended to lead to
    a simple\n   roadmap from the IPv4 Internet to a pure IPv6 one.\n\n   With it,
    applications, protocol stacks and customer edge devices need\n   only one standardized
    intermediate v5 version between v4 and v6.\n\n   Internet service providers upgrade
    their v4 service to two\n   intermediate services: one with a v4 address and a
    v6 prefix, and one\n   with only a v6 prefix but with access to transition tools
    within the\n   network.  Provision is also made for a standardized upgrade of
    3GPP\n   networks.\n\t </p>\n      "
