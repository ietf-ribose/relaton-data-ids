abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about
    Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network
    in order to provide traffic engineering path calculations for its associated Path
    Computation Clients (PCCs). Furthermore, PCEs are used to compute shortest constrained
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains. This document
    describes general considerations for the deployment of stateful PCE(s) in inter-domain
    scenarios including inter-area and inter-AS. The inter-layer considerations will
    be described in a separate document. This document does not specify any extensions
    to PCEP.</p>"
