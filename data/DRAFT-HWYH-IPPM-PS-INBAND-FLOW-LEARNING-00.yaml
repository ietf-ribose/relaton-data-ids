abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Alternate-Marking (coloring) provides a method to perform packet\n
    \  loss, delay, and jitter measurements on live traffic.  At the same\n   time,
    on-path telemetry techniques are used to enable the collection\n   and correlation
    of performance information to further support\n   autonomous network operations.
    \ However, network operators still face\n   the challenge of inband flow identification
    in large scale\n   deployment.  This document addresses the problems by introducing
    the\n   real network scenarios, and proposes the requirements of supporting\n
    \  inband flow learning of flow information telemetry.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
