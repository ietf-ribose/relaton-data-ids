abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism
    to\n   collect data from networking devices.  A shim header is proposed to\n   facilitate
    the data streaming directly from the publishing process on\n   network processor
    of line cards to receivers.  The objective is to\n   provide a lightweight approach
    to enable higher frequency and less\n   performance impact on publisher and receiver
    processes compared to\n   already established notification mechanisms.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
