abstract:
- content: <p>This document enables DNS initiators to send a main question accompanying
    with several related questions in a single DNS query, and enables DNS responders
    to put the answers into a single DNS response. This extension enables a range
    of initiators to look up "X, or failing that, Y" in a better way than both current
    alternatives. This mechanism can reduce the number of DNS round- trips per application
    work-unit.</p>
