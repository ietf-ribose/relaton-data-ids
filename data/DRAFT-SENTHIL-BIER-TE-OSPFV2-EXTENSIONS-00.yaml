abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication\n
    \  (BIER) is a variant of BIER [RFC8279] to support explicit path\n   engineering.
    \ BIER-TE defines a (loose) source routed multicast\n   forwarding method where
    every hop and destination in the TE path is\n   identified via bits in the bitstring
    of the BIER header in the data\n   packets.  BIER-TE forwarding architecture is
    described in [I-D.draft-\n   ietf-bier-te-arch].  Control framework for Traffic
    Engineering with\n   BIER-TE forwarding plane is explained in [I-D.draft-eckert-teas-bier-\n
    \  te-framework].\n\n   This document describes the OSPF [RFC2328] protocol extension\n
    \  required for BIER-TE control framework with MPLS encapsulation\n   [RFC8296].
    \ Support for other encapsulation types is outside the\n   scope of this document.
    \ The use of multiple encapsulation types is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t
