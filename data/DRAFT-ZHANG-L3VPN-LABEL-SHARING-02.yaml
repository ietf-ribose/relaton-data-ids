abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method to be used by VPN Service
    Providers\n   to provide multi-homed CEs with fast protection of egress PEs. Egress\n
    \  PEs in a redundant group always share the same label in distribution\n   of
    VPN routes of a VRF. A virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS\n   backbone is
    created as the common end of LSP tunnels which would\n   otherwise terminate at
    each egress PE. Primary and backup LSP tunnels\n   ended at the vNH are set up
    by MPLS on basis of existing IGP FRR\n   mechanisms. If the primary egress PE
    fails, the backup egress PE can\n   recognize the \"shared\" VPN route label carried
    by the data packets.\n   Therefore, the failure affected data packets can be smoothly
    rerouted\n   to the backup PE for delivery without changing their VPN route label.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
