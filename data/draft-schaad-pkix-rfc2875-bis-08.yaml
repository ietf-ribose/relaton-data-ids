abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check
    value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity
    check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair. This behavior is needed for such
    operations as creating the signature of a Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
    #10 Certification Request. These algorithms are designed to provide a Proof-of-Possession
    of the private key and not to be a general purpose signing algorithm. This document
    obsoletes RFC 2875.</p>"
