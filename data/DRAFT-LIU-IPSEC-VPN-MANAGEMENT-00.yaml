abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a common interface format for describing
    the\n   configuration of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the context of\n   IPSec
    and equipment from different vendors. The configuration\n   format would be both
    importable and exportable by various vendors of\n   VPN equipment and software
    that is IPSec compliant, facilitating an\n   uniform and perhaps automated method
    of interoperability (creating\n   a VPN) between VPN products from different vendors.\n
    \n   This document will only discuss the proposed configuration format.\n   The
    mechanism by which the file is propagated is beyond the scope of\n   this document
    and will not be discussed.\n \n   A security association is not mandatory between
    two management\n   stations from different vendors wishing to employ this method
    of VPN\n   configuration, as this configuration format can easily be packaged
    in\n   a file and propagated out of band.\n\t </p>\n      "
