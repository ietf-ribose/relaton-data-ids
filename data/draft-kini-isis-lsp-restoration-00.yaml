abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of labelswitched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and withbandwidth guarantees (for label
    switched paths). The reliability ofthese LSPs can be increased by providing a
    backup LSP onto whichtraffic can be switched upon failure of an element in the
    path of theactive LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth can beshared
    between backup links of more than one active path while stillguaranteeing recoverability
    for a set of failures. This sharing greatlyincreases the network efficiency thereby
    increasing the number of LSPsthat can be carried while maintaining guarantees.
    Algorithms which canroute such recoverable LSPs while using only aggregate network
    usage information are being developed. To route the active LSP and the(possibly
    shared) backup LSP, the topology information of the networkis needed and this
    can be provided by a link state routing protocollike IS-IS. This document describes
    the encoding of the additionalinformation within the link state protocol data
    unit (LSPdu) of IS-ISto enable routing of shared backup paths.</p>"
