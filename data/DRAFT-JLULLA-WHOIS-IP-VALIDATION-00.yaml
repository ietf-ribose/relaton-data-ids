abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a service of providing a hint score
    of\n   name-ip validation by whois servers. The whois servers will receive\n   requests
    to provide a hint on degree of associativity between\n   given name and IP pairs.
    This service may be used to acertain that\n   the host a client intends to communicate
    with is indeed the host\n   the client expects it to be. While establishing secure
    sessions,\n   this service may also be used on top of certificate validation to\n
    \  detect any possibility of a trusted CA's issuing a fake\n   certificate for
    the server in question.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
