abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a YANG data model for Ethernet VPN services.
    The model is agnostic of the underlay. It apply to MPLS as well as to VxLAN encapsulation.
    The model is also agnostic of the services including E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE
    services. The merging of this model with L2 services model is for future investigation.
    Any "add- on" features such as EVPN IRB, EVPN overlay, etc. are for future investigation.
    This document mainly focuses on EVPN instance framework.</p>
