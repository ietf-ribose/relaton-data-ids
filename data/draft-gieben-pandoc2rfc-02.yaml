abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax variant,
    called Pandoc, and a (bit) of XML [RFC2629] as a source format for documents in
    the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for Comments (RFC) series. The goal of
    this technique is to let an author of an I-D focus on the main body of text without
    being distracted too much by XML tags, it does however not alleviate the need
    to typeset some files in XML.</p>"
