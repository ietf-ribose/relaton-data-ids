abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of
    different application domains and environments. This hetrogeneity implies that
    different security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality,
    integrity and source authentication of RTP/RTCP packets suitable for the various
    environments. The range of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application
    developers to pick the most suitable mechanism. This document provides an overview
    of a number of security solutions for RTP, and gives guidance for developers on
    how to choose the appropriate security mechanism.</p>"
