abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We describe a market mechanism for providing incentive for the
    review\nof IETF documents. Reviewers would be 'paid' by the IESG to for their\nreviews.
    In turn, document authors would need to 'pay' the IESG to\ntake up their documents.
    This mechanism rewards reviewers for their\nreviews, thus (hopefully) increasing
    the quantity and quality of\nreviews.\n\t </p>\n      "
