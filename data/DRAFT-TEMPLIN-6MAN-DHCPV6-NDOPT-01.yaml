abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) specifies a control message
    set for\n   nodes to discover neighbors, routers, prefixes and other services
    on\n   the link.  It also supports a manner of StateLess Address\n   AutoConfiguration
    (SLAAC).  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n   for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specifies
    a service for the stateful delegation of\n   addresses and prefixes.\n\n   Currently,
    at least two round-trip message exchanges are necessary in\n   order to perform
    the IPv6ND router discovery and DHCPv6 address/\n   prefix delegation functions.
    \ This document presents a protocol for\n   combining these two exchanges into
    a single exchange by joining the\n   two services into a single unified service.\n\n\t
