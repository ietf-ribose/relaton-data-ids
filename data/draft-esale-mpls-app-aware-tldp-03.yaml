abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent targeted LDP applications such as remote loop-free alternates
    (LFA) and BGP auto discovered pseudowire may automatically establish a tLDP session
    to any LSR in a network. The initiating LSR has information about the targeted
    applications to administratively control initiation of the session. However the
    responding LSR has no such information to control acceptance of this session.
    This document defines a mechanism to advertise and negotiate Targeted Applications
    Capability during LDP session initialization. As the responding LSR becomes aware
    of targeted applications, it may establish a limited number of tLDP sessions for
    certain applications. In addition, each targeted application is mapped to LDP
    Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Elements to advertise only necessary LDP FEC-label
    bindings over the session.</p>"
