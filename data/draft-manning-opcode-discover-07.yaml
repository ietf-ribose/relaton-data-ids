abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DISCOVER opcode, an experimental extension
    to the Domain Name System (DNS) to use multicast queries for resource discovery.
    This opcode was tested in experiments run during 1995 and 1996 for the Topology
    Based Domain Search (TBDS) project. This project is no longer active and there
    are no current plans to restart it. TBDS was the first known use of multicast
    transport for DNS. A client multicasts a DNS query using the DISCOVER opcode and
    processes the multiple responses that may result. This document defines a Historic
    Document for the Internet community.</p>"
