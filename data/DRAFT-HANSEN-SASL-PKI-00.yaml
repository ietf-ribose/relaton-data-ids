abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a user/password Simple Authentication and\nSecurity
    Layer(SASL) mechanism called the PKI mechanism.  The PKI\nmechanism is intended
    to be used in situations where (1) passwords must\nbe encrypted, (2) the password
    must be recoverable, and (3) using TLS in\ncombination with a SASL mechanism such
    as PLAIN is inappropriate.\nNOTE: This document is a straw proposal to see what
    interest there\nis in having a SASL mechanism such as this.  See the first section
    below\nfor more information on why this mechanism is needed.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n
