abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based protocol.
    A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP or DTLS
    as transports. These transports are optimal solutions for CoAP use in IP-based
    constrained environments and nodes. However compelling motivation exists for allowing
    CoAP to operate with other transports and protocols. Examples are M2M communication
    in cellular networks using SMS, more suitable transport protocols for firewall/NAT
    traversal, end-to-end reliability and security such as TCP and TLS, or employing
    proxying and tunneling gateway techniques such as the WebSocket protocol. This
    draft examines the requirements for conveying CoAP messages to end points over
    such alternative transports. It also provides a new URI format for representing
    CoAP resources over alternative transports.</p>"
