abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental method to extend the limited
    space for control options in every segment of a TCP connection. It can use a dual
    handshake so that, from the very first SYN segment, extra option space can immediately
    start to be used optimistically. At the same time a dual handshake prevents a
    legacy server from getting confused and sending the control options to the application
    as user-data. The dual handshake is only one strategy - a single handshake will
    usually suffice once deployment has got started. The protocol is designed to traverse
    most known middleboxes including connection splitters, because it sits wholly
    within the TCP Data. It also provides reliable ordered delivery for control options.
    Therefore, it should allow new TCP options to be introduced i) with minimal middlebox
    traversal problems; ii) with incremental deployment from legacy servers; iii)
    without an extra round of handshaking delay iv) without having to provide its
    own loss recovery and ordering mechanism and v) without arbitrary limits on available
    space.</p>"
