abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast
    service.\n   Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own\n
    \  mandates and requirements.  It might be desirable to deploy BIER\n   technology
    in some part of these networks to replace traditional PIM\n   services.  In such
    cases downstream PIM states need to be signaled\n   over the BIER Domain toward
    the source.\n\n   This draft specifies the procedure to signal PIM join/prune
    messages\n   through a BIER Domain, as such enabling the provisioning of\n   traditional
    PIM services through a BIER Domain.  These procedures are\n   valid for forwarding
    PIM join/prune messages to the Source (SSM) or\n   Rendezvous Point (ASM).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
