abstract:
  content: "<p>This document discusses common practices used in deploying routingprotocols
    in both public and private networks. The focus is not todescribe how routing protocols
    should be deployed, but rather howthey are generally deployed, to provide those
    working onspecifications which impact the operation of routing protocols withguidance
    in what will likely be deployed, or what will likely not bedeployed. The focus
    in thie document will be ionterdomain routing,but it will cover aspects of intradomain
    routing, as well.1. BackgroundWhen considering new extensions to existing routing
    protocols, it'suseful to consider them in the context of existing usage of theseprotocols.
    Various questions come to mind, such as:o Common Underlying Principles of Network
    Designso Common Practices in Route Originationo Common Practices in Routing Database
    Managemento Common Practices in Aggregationo Common Practices in Peeringo Common
    Practices in Securityo ....Each of these topics will be covered in a separate
    section below.</p>"
