abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses
    and\n   their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed\n   through.
    When an ingress RBridge receives a data frame with its\n   destination address
    (MAC&amp;VLAN) unknown, the data frame is flooded\n   within the VLAN across the
    TRILL campus. When there are more than\n   one RBridge ports connected to one
    bridged LAN, only one of them can\n   be designated as the Appointed Forwarder
    port for\n   forwarding/receiving native traffic to/from each VLAN, the other\n
    \  RBridge ports on that LAN have to be disabled for native traffic in\n   that
    VLAN.\n\n   This draft describes the framework for using directory services to\n
    \  assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames,\n   particularly
    unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, improving\n   TRILL network scalability
    in environment, such as data centers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
