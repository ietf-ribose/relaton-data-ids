abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an Applicability Statement for various IETF Technical
    Specifications, including the Host Identity Protocol (HIPv2) and the Domain Name
    System (DNS), complementing emerging external standards for Unmanned Aircraft
    System (UAS) remote identification (RID). The objectives are: to facilitate use
    of existing Internet services to support UAS RID and to enable enhanced RID related
    services; and to enable verification that UAS RID information is trustworthy (to
    some extent, even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node).</p>"
