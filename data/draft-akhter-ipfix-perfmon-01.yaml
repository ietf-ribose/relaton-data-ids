abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance
    ofnetwork applications and the network service in handling user data.This performance
    data provides information essential in validatingservice level agreements, fault
    isolation as well as early warningsof greater problems. This document describes
    IPFIX InformationElements related to performance measurement of network basedapplications.
    In addition, to the performance information severalnon-metric information elements
    are also included to provide greatercontext to the reports. The measurements use
    audio/videoapplications as a base but are not restricted to these class ofapplications.</p>"
