abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the naming and addressing schemes used
    in the\n   Mathematical Mesh.  The means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint\n
    \  (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs are\n   described.\n\n
    \  A UDF consists of a binary sequence, the initial eight bits of which\n   specify
    a type identifier code.  Type identifier codes have been\n   selected so as to
    provide a useful mnemonic indicating their purpose\n   when presented in Base32
    encoding.\n\n   Two categories of UDF are described.  Data UDFs provide a compact\n
    \  presentation of a fixed length binary data value in a format that is\n   convenient
    for data entry.  A Data UDF may represent a cryptographic\n   key, a nonce value
    or a share of a secret.  Fingerprint UDFs provide\n   a compact presentation of
    a Message Digest or Message Authentication\n   Code value.\n\n   A Strong Internet
    Name (SIN) consists of a DNS name which contains at\n   least one label that is
    a UDF fingerprint of a policy document\n   controlling interpretation of the name.
    \ SINs allow a direct trust\n   model to be applied to achieve end-to-end security
    in existing\n   Internet applications without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n
    \  UDFs may be presented as URIs to form either names or locators for\n   use
    with the UDF location service.  An Encrypted Authenticated\n   Resource Locator
    (EARL) is a UDF locator URI presenting a service\n   from which an encrypted resource
    may be obtained and a symmetric key\n   that may be used to decrypt the content.
    \ EARLs may be presented on\n   paper correspondence as a QR code to securely
    provide a machine-\n   readable version of the same content.  This may be applied
    to\n   automate processes such as invoicing or to provide accessibility\n   services
    for the partially sighted.\n\n   [Note to Readers]\n\n   Discussion of this draft
    takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list\n   (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived
    at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.\n\n   This
    document is also available online at\n   http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-udf.html.\n\n\t
