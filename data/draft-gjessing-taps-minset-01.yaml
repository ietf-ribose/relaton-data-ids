abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft will eventually recommend a minimal set of IETF Transport
    Services offered by end systems supporting TAPS, and give guidance on choosing
    among the available mechanisms and protocols. It categorizes the set of transport
    services given in the TAPS document draft-ietf-taps-transports-usage-00, assuming
    that the eventual minimal set of transport services will be based on a similar
    form of categorization.</p>"
