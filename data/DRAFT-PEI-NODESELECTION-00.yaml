abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Based on the hybrid spectrum sensing method, this paper proposes
    a\n   SENS node selection algorithm which effectively reduces the number\n   of
    nodes participated in spectrum sensing. The algorithm reduces the\n   loads and
    energy consumption of the cognitive wireless sensor\n   networks. It conforms
    to the development trend of current cognitive\n   wireless sensor networks. At
    the same time, This method is also\n   suitable for traditional wireless sensor
    networks. This algorithm\n   which considers the perception of energy consumption
    and performance\n   parameters of nodes forms a node priority function, The network\n
    \  selects the nodes according to the priority of nodes, It reduces\n   energy
    consumption and improves the spectrum sensing performance. In\n   the cooperative
    spectrum sensing, sensor nodes transmit the sensing\n   results to the fusion
    center. Moreover, this paper uses the \"OR\"\n   standard, the node whose local
    sensing decision is \"1\" transmits the\n   local sensing result to the fusion
    center. So it can reduce the\n   energy consumption in the process of spectrum
    sensing and achieve\n   the purpose of energy saving.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
