abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines semantics that allow for signalling a
    new SDP\n   group \"OL\" for overlays in an immersive telepresence session.  The\n
    \  \"OL\" attribute can be used by the application to relate all the\n   overlay
    media streams enabling them to be added as overlay on top of\n   the immersive
    video.  The overlay grouping semantics is required, if\n   the media data is seperate
    and transported via different protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
