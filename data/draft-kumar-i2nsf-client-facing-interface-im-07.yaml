abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an information model for Consumer-Facing interface
    to Security Controller based on the requirements identified in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-client-facing-interface-req].
    The information model defines various managed objects and relationship among these
    objects needed to build the interface. The information model is organized based
    on the "Event-Condition-Event" (ECA) policy model defined by a capability information
    model for Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability].</p>
