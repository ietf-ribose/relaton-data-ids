abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is widely deployed to signal Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) due to its simple operational model. Since LDP establishes
    LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is gated by the interior gateway
    protocol's (IGP's) re-convergence. Though some mechanisms exist to do Fast Re-route
    (FRR) of LDP LSPs, they suffer from significant complexity or lack of full coverage
    or both. This document describes a method to perform FRR of LDP LSPs that retains
    the simple operational model of LDP. The goal is to provide 100% coverage for
    all failure scenarios including Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure with recovery
    characteristics similar to the methods in Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering FRR (RSVP-TE-FRR).</p>"
