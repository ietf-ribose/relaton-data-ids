abstract:
  content: "<p>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records asa
    means to authorize Third-Party domains. This mechanism allowsfirst-party domains
    to autonomously authorize a range of third-partydomains in a scalable, individual
    DNS transaction. Thisauthorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions
    to supplantmore difficult to administer mechanisms. Alternatives forfacilitating
    third-party authorizations currently necessitate thecoordination between two or
    more domains by setting up selector/keyDNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the
    regular exchange of public/private keys.Checking DKIM policies may occur when
    a From header email-address isnot within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.
    When a Third-Partysignature is found, TPA-labels offer an efficient means for
    emailaddress domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains.The scope
    of the authorization may separately assert identityauthentication for From and
    Sender and Resent-* headers for email-addresses within the authorizing domain.
    Identity authentication canbe asserted by the scope of the authorization, even
    when signed by aThird-Party domain. In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain canauthorize
    domains for controlling DSNs.</p>"
