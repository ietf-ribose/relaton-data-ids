abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes technology that enables for Inter-Domain\n
    \  signaling of existence of E2E path that satisfy high-level traffic\n   treatment
    behavior intent.  The inter-domain path is built by the BGP\n   protocol, as a
    concatenation of per TE-domain internal paths\n   (segments), provisioned by one
    of existing intra-domain techniques.\n   The traffic treatment behavior is encoded
    as an integer value called\n   as \"COLOR\".  The domain internal paths/tunnels
    are marked as\n   satisfying given traffic treatment behavior.  Then the tunnel\n
    \  destination and its COLOR are exchanged between TE-Domains using a\n   new
    BGP LABELED-COLORED-UNICAST NLRI (BGP-LCU) defined in this\n   document.\n\n\t
