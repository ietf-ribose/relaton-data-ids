abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Upper Layer Bindings to allow use of
    RPC-\n   over-RDMA by protocols related to the Network File System (NFS).\n   Such
    bindings are required when using RPC-over-RDMA, in order to\n   enable use of
    Direct Data Placement and for a number of other\n   reasons.  These bindings are
    structured to be applicable to all known\n   version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport,
    including optional\n   extensions.  All versions of NFS are addressed.\n\n\n\t
