abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol for Client Application Layer Encryption offers organizations
    a method of securely providing users data with very few authentication steps.
    This protocol makes use of X.509 public key infrastructure and SHOULD NOT be implemented
    without transport layer security. The protocol described below helps to ensure
    that response messages may only be read by the intended recipient.</p>"
