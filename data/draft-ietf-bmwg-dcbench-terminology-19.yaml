abstract:
- content: "<p>The purposes of this informational document are to establish definitions
    and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as to
    introduce new terminology applicable to performance evaluations of data center
    network equipment. This document establishes the important concepts for benchmarking
    network switches and routers in the data center and is a prerequisite for the
    test methodology document (RFC 8239). Many of these terms and methods may be applicable
    to network equipment beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally
    applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere.</p>"
