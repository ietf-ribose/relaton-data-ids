abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Label-switched paths (LSPs) play fundument role in MPLS
    domain.\n   Traditionally Label-switched paths (LSPs) are established by the\n
    \  network operator via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF for a variety of purposes,\n   such
    as to create network-based IP virtual private networks or to\n   route traffic
    along specified paths through the network.  Interface\n   to the Routing System's
    (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces provides an\n   alternate way to create and maintain
    the LSPs.This document describes\n   requirement and use case for which I2RS can
    be used for LSPs\n   management.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
