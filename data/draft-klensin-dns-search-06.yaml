abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching' --finding
    of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately pointto DNS names, by
    a mechanism layered above the DNS itself thatpermits fuzzy matching, selection
    that uses attributes or facets, anduse of descriptive terms. Demand for these
    facilities appear to beincreasing with growth in the Internet (and especially
    the web) andwith requirements to move beyond the restricted subset of ASCII namesthat
    have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'. Thisdocument proposes a
    three-level system for access to DNS names inwhich the upper two levels involve
    search, rather than lookup(exactly known target), functions. It also discusses
    some of theissues and challenges in completing the design of, and deploying,such
    a system.</p>"
