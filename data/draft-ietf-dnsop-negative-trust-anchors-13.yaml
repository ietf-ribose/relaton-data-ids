abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.
    However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable
    as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes. This
    document defines Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs), which can be used to mitigate
    DNSSEC validation failures by disabling DNSSEC validation at specified domains.</p>"
