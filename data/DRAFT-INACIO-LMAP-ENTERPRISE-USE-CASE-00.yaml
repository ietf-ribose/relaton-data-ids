abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP)
    working\n   group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large-\n
    \  scale networks.  The use case will describe how very large enterprise\n   networks
    are not very different from the networks considered by other\n   LMAP use cases
    and that most measurements are useful to both use\n   cases.  In addition this
    use case will state the need for the ability\n   to have finer grained observation
    related to User Experience\n   potentially on a per application basis.\n\n\n\t
