abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Presence service can have constraints for delivering presence\ninformation
    to devices with low data processing capabilities, small\ndisplay, and limited
    battery power. Other limitations can be caused\nby the interface between the terminal
    and the network, i.e. over\nradio links with high latency and low bandwidth. This
    memo presents a\nsolution that aids in reducing the impact of those constrains
    and to\nincrease efficiency, by introducing a mechanism called partial\nnotification.\n\t
