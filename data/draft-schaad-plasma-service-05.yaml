abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC TBD describes a new model and set of requirements to implement
    a labeling system on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) objects where the entity
    in charge of doing the label enforcement is under the control of a central authority
    rather than the recipient of the object. This document describes a protocol to
    be used by senders and recipients of CMS objects to communicate with a centralized
    label enforcement server. The document outlines how a client will get the set
    of labels or policies that it can use for sending messages, composes a secure
    CMS object with a label on it and gets the necessary keys to decrypt a CMS object
    from the server. This document is designed to be used with RFC TBD2 which describes
    the extensions used in CMS objects to hold the label information.</p>"
