abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergence of applications based on machine-to-machine communications
    require control systems to be extended beyond their closed environments. Specifically,
    autonomous systems that bring about physical and mechanical changes to an environment,
    heavily rely on their remote operations and control. This document provides an
    overview of the issues associated with the communications in the control systems
    to support network-based operations in a generic manner at any-scale environments.
    The term Operations and Control networks (OCN) is used to describe the common
    characteristics emerging from the requirements for such control systems. The OCNs
    are technology-agnostic concept. This document aims to discuss the requirements
    for establishing common interfaces and functions.</p>"
