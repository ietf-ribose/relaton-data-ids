abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes identifier-locator addressing
    (ILA) in\n   IPv6 for network virtualization. Identifier-locator addressing\n
    \  differentiates between location and identity of a network node. Part\n   of
    an address expresses the immutable identity of the node, and\n   another part
    indicates the location of the node which can be dynamic.\n   In the context of
    virtualization, a virtual address serves as an\n   identifier and the address
    of the host where the associated tenant\n   system currently resides is a locator.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
