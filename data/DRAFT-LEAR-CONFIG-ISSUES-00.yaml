abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>How are network elements configured?  What are the different ways
    in \nwhich a device receives configuration, and why do they use those \nparticular
    mechanisms?  How do these mechanisms perform for their \ngiven use?  This document
    discusses the problem of device \nconfiguration and state exchange.  As we do
    so we will point out some \nprotocol considerations, such as the objects being
    transported, how \ntransfers are initiated, and what the security requirements
    are.\n\t </p>\n      "
