abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The TTL of a DNS Resource Record expresses how long a record
    may be\n   cached before it should be discarded.  This document discusses the\n
    \  possibility of \"stretching TTLS\" (using them past their expiration)\n   if
    they cannot be refreshed.  This works on the assumption that stale\n   data may
    be better than no data.\n\n   PLEASE NOTE: This document is a strawman to drive
    discussion.  It may\n   or may not be a good idea; this document documents the
    idea so that\n   there is something concrete to throw tomatoes at.\n\n   [ Ed
    note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information,
    answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be
    removed before publication.  This document is\n   being collaborated on in Github
    at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-\n   wkumari-dnsop-ttl-stretching.  The most
    recent version of the\n   document, open issues, etc should all be available here.
