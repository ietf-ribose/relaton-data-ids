abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the ECDH-1PU public key authenticated\n
    \  encryption algorithm for JWE.  The algorithm is similar to the\n   existing
    ECDH-ES encryption algorithm, but adds an additional ECDH\n   key agreement between
    static keys of the sender and recipient.  This\n   additional step allows the
    recipient to be assured of sender\n   authenticity without requiring a nested
    signed-then-encrypted message\n   structure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
