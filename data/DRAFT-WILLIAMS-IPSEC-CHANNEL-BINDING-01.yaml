abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the end-point channel bindings for \"IPsec\nchannels\"
    where the peers used the Internet Key Exchange protocol\nversion 2 (IKEv2) and
    where they used public keys and/or certificates\nto authenticate each other.  Specifically,
    we use hashes of the end-\npoints' public keys.\n\t </p>\n      "
