abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose a novel framework for inter-area MPLS optimal routing.
    The \nkey to our proposal lies in deploying an overlaid star optical \nnetwork
    in the OSPF backbone area and introducing the concept of \n\"virtual area border
    routers\" (v-ABRs). Compared with other \nproposals, our framework can provide
    globally optimized inter-area \nrouting and has very good compatibility to existing
    traditional \nIP/MPLS routers.  \n\n\t </p>\n      "
