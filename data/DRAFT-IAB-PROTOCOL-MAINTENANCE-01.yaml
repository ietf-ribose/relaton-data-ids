abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Jon Postel's famous statement of \"Be liberal in what you accept,
    and\n   conservative in what you send\" is a principle that has long guided\n
    \  the design and implementation of Internet protocols.  The posture\n   this
    statement advocates promotes interoperability in the short term,\n   but can negatively
    affect the protocol ecosystem.  For a protocol\n   that is actively maintained,
    the Postel's robustness principle can,\n   and should, be avoided.\n\n\t </p>\n
