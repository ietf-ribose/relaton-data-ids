abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"Basic\" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does
    not\n   properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to\n
    \  a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers\n   make
    different assumptions based on the locales they are running in.\n   There is little
    interoperability for characters in the ISO-8859-1\n   character set, and even
    less interoperability for any characters\n   beyond that.\n\n   This document
    defines a backwards-compatible extension to \"Basic\",\n   specifying the server's
    character encoding expectation, using a new\n   authentication scheme parameter.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
