abstract:
  content: "\t <t>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is
    alink-layer agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) to
    enable network access authentication between clients andaccess networks.PANA framework
    defines two types of security associations which canbe bootstrapped as a consequence
    of PANA execution: IP layer securityis established with IPsec by using IKE and
    link-layer security withWPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode.This document is focused
    on how PANA can bootstrap link layersecurity through IEEE 802.11i and exposes
    issues which can be raisedas a consequence of this interaction.</p>"
