abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to establish a secure end-to-end channel
    between two parties within a federation, where both client and server are mutually
    authenticated. The trust relationship is based upon a trust anchor held and published
    by the federation. A federation is a trusted third party that inter-connect different
    trust domains with a common set of policies and standards.</p>"
