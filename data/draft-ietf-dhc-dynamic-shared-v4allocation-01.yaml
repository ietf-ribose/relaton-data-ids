abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses
    to clients using DHCPv4. Address sharing allows a single IPv4 address to be allocated
    to multiple, active clients simultaneously, each client being differentiated by
    a unique set of transport source port numbers. The necessary changes to existing
    DHCPv4 client and server behavior are described and a new DHCPv4 option for provisioning
    clients with shared IPv4 addresses is included. Due to the nature of IP addresses
    sharing, some limitations to their applicability are necessary. This memo describes
    these limitations and recommends suitable architectures and technologies where
    address sharing may be utilized.</p>"
