abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Operational procedures and protocols of today's communicationnetworks
    typically use explicitly defined mechanisms andrepresentations to reach the goals
    associated to their design. Thispractice results into numerous protocols having
    a restricted spacefor (self-)adaptability, flexibility, and sensitivity respective
    totheir network context (e.g. network traffic conditions, failureconditions, etc).
    On the other hand, a wide spectrum of learning andoptimization techniques is available
    such that networks could learnand optimize their behavior in the running context.
    This documentdescribes the opportunities and challenges for a Learning CapableCommunication
    Network (LCCN).</p>"
