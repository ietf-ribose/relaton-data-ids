abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking
    (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast
    data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
    latency within a network domain. Techniques used include: 1) reserving data plane
    resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate
    nodes along the path of the flow; 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows
    that do not immediately change with the network topology; and 3) distributing
    data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each
    packet's data in spite of the loss of a path. DetNet operates at the IP layer
    and delivers service over sub-network technologies such as MPLS and IEEE 802.1
    Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).</p>"
