abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language
    (UVML),\n   a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text.\n
    \  Using UVML, opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and\n   reliably
    interpreted by either human readers or automated-agents.\n   UVML supports both
    rating and ranking semantics.  Ratings may be\n   scored using symbols associated
    with the five most commonly used\n   opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!),
    outlook($), support-\n   opposition(+), and likelihood(%).  In addition, UVML
    defines a syntax\n   for optionally including a demographic signature by which
    voters can\n   publish basic demographic information with their UVML votes.  The\n
    \  design of UVML leverages cross-cultural sentiment and voting-systems\n   scholarship.\n\n\t
