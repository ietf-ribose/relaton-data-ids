abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a TCP Simple Authentication Option
    (TCP-SA) \n   which is intended to replace the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC-2385
    \n   (TCP/MD5). TCP-SA specifies the use of stronger HMAC-based hashes and \n
    \  provides more details on the association of security associations \n   with
    TCP connections. TCP-SA assumes an external, out-of-band \n\n   mechanism (manual
    or via a separate protocol) for session key \n   establishment, parameter negotiation,
    and rekeying, replicating the \n   separation of key management and key use as
    in the IPsec suite. The \n   result is intended to be a simple modification to
    support current \n   infrastructure uses of TCP/MD5, such as to protect BGP and
    LDP, to \n   support a larger set of hashes with minimal other system and \n   operational
    changes. TCP-SA requires no new option identifier, though \n   it is intended
    to be mutually exclusive with TCP/MD5 on a given TCP \n   connection. It can be
    used in the presence of NATs/NAPTs, and \n   supports IPv6, and is fully compatible
    with requirements under \n   development for an update to TCP/MD5. \n\n\t </p>\n
