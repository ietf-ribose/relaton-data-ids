abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6265, defining the "origin" attribute for cookies
    and the "Origin-Cookie" header field, which together allow servers to choose to
    harmonize the security policy of their cookies with the same-origin policy which
    governs other available client-side storage mechanisms.</p>
