abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Service usage might require some form of compensation and this
    is\n   also true for many communication systems where an entity receiving a\n
    \  call should be able to charge the caller.  This is necessary for\n   allowing
    fair communication between two communicating parties and is\n   a major strategy
    for reducing the viability of SPAM.  This draft\n   proposes an approach for doing
    this in SIP using the Security\n   Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  It relies
    on a third party to act\n   as a payment provider and is designed for low value
    transactions.  It\n   does not aim to provide the same capability as other authentication,\n
    \  authorization and accounting backend infrastructures.\n\t </p>\n      "
