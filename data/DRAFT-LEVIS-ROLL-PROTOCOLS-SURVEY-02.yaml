abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing\n
    \  issues.  Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and\n   smart
    objects, have difficult constraints: very limited memory,\n   little processing
    power, and long sleep periods.  As most of these\n   devices are battery-powered,
    energy efficiency is critically\n   important.  Wireless link qualities can vary
    significantly over time,\n   requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize
    topology\n   change energy costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks\n
    \  has requirements that existing mesh protocols only partially address.\n   This
    document provides a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses\n   of existing
    protocols with respect to this class of networks.  It\n   provides guidance on
    how lessons from existing and prior efforts can\n   be leveraged in future protocol
    design.\n\t </p>\n      "
