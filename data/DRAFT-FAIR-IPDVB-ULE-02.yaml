abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MPEG-2 TS has been widely accepted not only for providing
    \ndigital TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology for \nbuilding IP networks.
    This document describes an Ultra Lightweight \nEncapsulation (ULE) mechanism for
    the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 \nDatagrams and other network protocol packets
    directly over ISO MPEG-\n2 Transport Streams (TS) as TS Private Data.\n\t </p>\n
