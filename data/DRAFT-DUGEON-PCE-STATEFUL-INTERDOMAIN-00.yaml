abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a\n   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation\n   Element
    as a tool to help MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels and Segment\n   Routing paths placement.
    \ This also include the ability to compute\n   inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing
    path following a distributed or\n   hierarchical approach.  In complement to the
    original stateless mode,\n   a stateful mode has been added.  In particular, the
    new PCInitiate\n   message allows a PCE to directly ask a PCC to setup an MPLS-TE,
    GMPLS\n   LSP tunnel or a Segment Routing path.  However, once computed, the\n
    \  inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path are hard to setup in the\n   underlying
    network.  Especially, in operational network, RSVP-TE\n   signaling is not enable
    between AS border routers.  But, such RSVP-TE\n   signaling is mandatory to setup
    contiguous LSP tunnels or to stitch\n   or nest independent LSP tunnels to form
    the end-to-end inter-domain\n   paths.  This document proposes to combine a Backward
    Recursive or\n   Hierarchical method with PCInitiate message to setup independent\n
    \  paths per domain, and combine these different paths together in order\n   to
    operated them as end-to-end inter-domain paths without the need of\n   signaling
    session between AS border routers.  A new Stitching Label\n   is defined and new
    LSP-TYPE code points are considered for that\n   purpose.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
