abstract:
  content: "\t <t>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network.MPLS
    can carry any data payload whichgives the flexibility to the service provider
    to provisionnew service with any expense.In a scaled MPLS RSVP router during MBB/Global
    repair, router needs to program large number of labels into PFE.This operation
    results in lot of label re-computation and label programming.This draft is proposing
    a solution to label reusage</p>"
