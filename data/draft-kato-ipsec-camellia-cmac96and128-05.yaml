abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec. One is the usageof
    Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with the Camelliablock cipher
    as an authentication mechanism in the IPsecEncapsulating Security Payload and
    Authentication Header protocols.This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96. The
    other algorithm is apseudo-random function (PRF) based on CMAC with the Camellia
    blockcipher for the Internet Key Exchange, version 2. This algorithm iscalled
    Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF
