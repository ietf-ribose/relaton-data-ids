abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes a solution, based on fractional addresses,
    to face\nthe IPv4 public address exhaustion.  It details the solution and\npresents
    a mock-up implementation, with the results of tests that\nvalidate the concept.
    \ It also describes architectures and how\nfractional addresses are used to overcome
    the IPv4 address shortage.\nA comparison with the alternative Carrier-Grade NAT
    (CG-NAT)\nsolutions is also elaborated in the document.  The IPv6 variant of\nthis
    solution is described in a companion draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
