abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Domain Name System (DNS) mechanism
    for the\n   MANET based on the centralized DNS mechanism used in the wired\n   Internet.
    In order to adapt to the dynamic topology changes of the\n   MANET, the mechanism
    handles the movement of the DNS server and the\n   MANET merge/partition.\n\n\t
