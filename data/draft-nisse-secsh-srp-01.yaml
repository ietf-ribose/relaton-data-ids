abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes an experimental method for authentication andkeyexchange
    in the Secure Shell protocol.The main virtue of the SRP protocol [SRP] is that
    it providesauthentication based on a small secret (typically a password). It isuseful
    in situations where no authentic host key is known. For SecureShell, it can be
    used as a bootstrapping procedure to get the hostkey of a server in a safe way.
    SRP also provides authentication ofthe user, which means that it might make sense
    to either skip thesecsh 'ssh-userauth'-service [SSH-USERAUTH] when using SRP,
    or allowlogin with the 'none' or 'external-keyx' method.</p>"
