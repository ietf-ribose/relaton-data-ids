abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Interative Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been specified
    as a\nNAT traversal mechanism for protocols based on the offer/answer\nexchange
    model.  In practice, only the Session Initiation Protocol\n(SIP) has used ICE.
    \ This document provides guidance on how other\nprotocols can make use of ICE.\n\t
