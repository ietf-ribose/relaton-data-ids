abstract:
- content: "<p>Several IPv6 transition mechanisms require the usage of stateless or
    stateful translators (commonly named as NAT64) able to allow IP/ICMP communication
    between IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Those translators are using either a default Well-Known
    Prefix (WKP), and/or one or several additional Network Specific Prefix (NSP),
    which need to be configured into the nodes willing to use the translator. Different
    translators will likely have different IPv6 prefixes, to attract traffic to the
    correct translator. Thus, an automatic translator prefix discovery method is necessary.
    This document defines a DHCPv6-based method to inform DHCPv6 clients the set of
    IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes it serves. This DHCPv6 option can be used by several transition
    mechanisms such as SIIT, 464XLAT, EAM.</p>"
