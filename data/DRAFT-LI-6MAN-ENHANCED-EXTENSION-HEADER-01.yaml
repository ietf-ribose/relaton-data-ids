abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As SRv6 and the new services such as IOAM are progressing,
    more and\n   more new requirements are imposed upon the IPv6 extension headers,\n
    \  i.e.. Hop-by-hop Options Header, Destination Options Header and\n   Routing
    Header.\n\n   This document defines new IPv6 extension headers and corresponding\n
    \  processing procedures considering the interactions among the existing\n   IPv6
    extension headers, SRH and the newly introduced IPv6 extension\n   headers.\n\n\n\t
