abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Conventional deployments store keys on PC hard disks, application-
    \nserver hard disks, or in tokens, and also introduce complications  \nfor user
    enrollment and management.  User and administrator  \nfrustration with the conventional
    approach has cramped development  \nof a market for PKI.  As a result, PKI has
    not reached its  \nutilization potential and is far from becoming ubiquitous.
    \n \nThis document describes architecture for deployment of secure and  \nefficient
    digital signature capabilities based on a centralized key- \nmanagement approach
    and emphasizes the importance of not disrupting  \nexisting identity and authentication
    management and application  \ninfrastructure.  An alternative architecture is
    documented here so  \nthat PKI deployments will lower their associated administrative
    \ \nburdens and deliver improved scalability.\n\t </p>\n      "
