abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a P2P CDN (Content Delivery Network) based\ncontent
    sharing system using PPSP (Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol)\nand RELOAD (REsource
    LOcation And Discovery).  The P2P CDN provides a\nunified platform for service/content
    providers and content sharing\nusers to share content efficiently and safely.
    \ The shared contents\nmay include streaming media, files, etc.  This content
    sharing system\nuses PPSP as signaling protocol for P2P content distributing,
    and\nuses RELOAD to improve reliability and scalability.  More\nspecifically,
    RELOAD is used to construct P2P overlays storing of\nmassive contents and locating
    contents reliably.\n\t </p>\n      "
