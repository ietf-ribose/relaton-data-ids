abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how a watcher seeks the geographic location information
    from presentity. SIP Location Conveyance defines how location is sent from one
    entity to another unsolicited. This document specifies how a watcher, i.e., a
    Location Target, requests for specific geolocation state information of a presentity,
    in addition to the details within the subscription such as the format (geo or
    civic) returned and the frequency of updated location from the presentity.</p>"
