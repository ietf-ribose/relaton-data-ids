abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private
    Network (VPN+). The purpose of VPN+ is to support the needs of new applications
    (e.g. low latency, bounded jitter, etc.), by utilizing an approach that is based
    on the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies, and adds characteristics
    that specific services require beyond those provided by existing VPNs. Typically,
    VPN+ will be used to underpin network slicing, but could also be of use in its
    own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites. This
    document also provides an overview of relevant technologies in different network
    layers, and identifies some areas for potential new work.</p>"
