abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS),
    a\n   hash-based digital signature system.  It follows existing\n   descriptions
    in scientific literature.  The note specifies the WOTS+\n   one-time signature
    scheme, a single-tree (XMSS) and a multi-tree\n   variant (XMSS^MT) of XMSS.  Both
    variants use WOTS+ as a main\n   building block.  XMSS provides cryptographic
    digital signatures\n   without relying on the conjectured hardness of mathematical
    problems.\n   Instead, it is proven that it only relies on the properties of\n
    \  cryptographic hash functions.  XMSS provides strong security\n   guarantees
    and, besides some special instantiations, is even secure\n   when the collision
    resistance of the underlying hash function is\n   broken.  It is suitable for
    compact implementations, relatively\n   simple to implement, and naturally resists
    side-channel attacks.\n   Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures
    withstand\n   attacks using quantum computers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
