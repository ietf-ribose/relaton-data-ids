abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how Service Function Chaining (SFC) can be
    achieved in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the Network
    Service Header (NSH) in an MPLS label stack. That is, the NSH is not used, but
    the fields of the NSH are mapped to fields in the MPLS label stack. This approach
    does not deprecate or replace the NSH, but it acknowledges that there may be a
    need for an interim deployment of SFC functionality in brownfield networks.</p>"
