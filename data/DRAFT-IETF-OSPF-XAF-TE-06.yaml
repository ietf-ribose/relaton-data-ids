abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6\n
    \  network, the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched\n   Paths
    (LSP) infrastructure may be duplicated, even if the destination\n   IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses belong to the same remote router.  In order\n   to achieve an integrated
    MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must\n   be computed over MPLS TE tunnels
    created using information propagated\n   in another OSPF instance.  This issue
    is solved by advertising cross-\n   address family (X-AF) OSPF TE information.\n\n
    \  This document describes an update to RFC5786 that allows for the easy\n   identification
    of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
