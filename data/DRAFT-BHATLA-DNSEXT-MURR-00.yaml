abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To date, the scenario of multiple IP addresses for same domain
    name \narises for the case where either we have multihomed IP hosts or we \nhave
    multiple servers having the same domain name and application \non the client needs
    to approach only one of those IP hosts. However, \nthe penetration of mobile hosts
    and personal devices identified, on \nthe internet, by the user's Network Access
    Identifier (NAI) may \ncreate a scenario where multiple devices may have same
    domain name \nbut different IP addresses and all of those devices may need to
    get \nthe service or data from the application which only identifies them \nby
    their host name.\n  \nThis document proposes to add a new Resource Record called
    the \nMultiple Unicast Resource Record (MURR) to the DNS system. This \nresource
    record is added for a domain name where the applications \nretrieving the IP address
    for the domain name have to provide the \nservice  (like PUSH data) to all the
    IP addresses retrieved in the \nmultiple MURRs for the domain name. \n\t </p>\n
