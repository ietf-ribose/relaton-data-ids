abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC)\n   framework, which provides header compression and fragmentation\n   functionality.
    \ SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area\n   Networks (LPWAN).\n\n   SCHC
    compression is based on a common static context stored in both\n   LPWAN devices
    and in the network sides.  This document defines SCHC\n   header compression mechanism
    and its deployment for IPv6/UDP headers.\n   This document also specifies a fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanism\n   that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement
    over the LPWAN\n   technologies.  The Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams
    that,\n   after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such\n
    \  compression, still exceed the layer two maximum payload size.\n\n   The SCHC
    header compression mechanism is independent of the specific\n   LPWAN technology
    over which it will be used.  Note that this document\n   defines generic functionalities
    and advisedly offers flexibility with\n   regard to parameters settings and mechanism
    choices, that are\n   expected to be made in other technology-specific documents.\n\n\t
