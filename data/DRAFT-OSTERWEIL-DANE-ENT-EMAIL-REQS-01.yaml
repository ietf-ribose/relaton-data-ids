abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Individuals and organizations have expressed a wish to have
    the\n   ability to send encrypted and/or digitally signed email end-to-end.\n
    \  One key obstacle to end-to-end email security is the difficulty in\n   discovering,
    obtaining, and validating email credentials across\n   administrative domains.
    \ This document addresses foreseeable adoption\n   obstacles for encrypted and
    digitally signed email in enterprises,\n   and outlines requirements.  Some of
    the requirements below are not\n   DANE specific, and all may not be solvable
    with a DANE solution, but\n   are included for completeness and as an attempt
    to give a holistic\n   view of enterprise email security requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n
