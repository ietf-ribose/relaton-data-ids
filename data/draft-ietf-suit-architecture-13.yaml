abstract:
- content: "<p>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
    need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism suitable for devices
    with resource constraints. Incorporating such an update mechanism is a fundamental
    requirement for fixing vulnerabilities but it also enables other important capabilities
    such as updating configuration settings as well as adding new functionality. In
    addition to the definition of terminology and an architecture this document motivates
    the standardization of a manifest format as a transport-agnostic means for describing
    and protecting firmware updates.</p>"
