abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This Internet-Draft presents the mechanism and correspondingsignalling
    protocol extensions for provisioned and dynamic lightpathrestoration schemes.
    The mechanisms proposed cover shared meshedrestoration as well as provisioned
    and non-provisioned schemes. Theformer (equivalent to lightpath protection) implies
    the provisioningof backup lightpaths in advance before failures occur.</p>"
