abstract:
  content: "<p>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance requirementof
    the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to monitorperformance metrics
    for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay forMPLS-TP pseudowires, Label Switched
    Paths, and Sections. Thisdocument specifies protocol mechanisms to facilitate
    the efficientand accurate measurement of these performance metrics.</p>"
