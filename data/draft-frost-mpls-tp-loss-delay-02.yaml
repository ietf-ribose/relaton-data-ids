abstract:
- content: "<p>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance requirement
    of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to monitor performance
    metrics for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay for MPLS-TP pseudowires,
    Label Switched Paths, and Sections. This document specifies protocol mechanisms
    to facilitate the efficient and accurate measurement of these performance metrics.</p>"
