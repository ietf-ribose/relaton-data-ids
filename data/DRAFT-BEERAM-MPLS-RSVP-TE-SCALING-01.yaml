abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    RSVP-TE [RFC3209] describes the use of standard RSVP [RFC2205]
    to\n    establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As such, RSVP-TE inherited\n    some
    properties of RSVP that adversely affect its control plane\n    scalability. Specifically
    these properties are (a) reliance on\n    periodic refreshes for state synchronization
    between RSVP neighbors\n    and for recovery from lost RSVP messages, (b) reliance
    on refresh\n    timeout for stale state cleanup, and (c) lack of any mechanisms
    by\n    which a receiver of RSVP messages can apply back pressure to the\n    sender(s)
    of these messages.\n\n    Subsequent to [RFC2205] and [RFC3209] further enhancements
    to RSVP\n    and RSVP-TE have been developed. In this document we describe how
    an\n    implementation of RSVP-TE can use these enhancements to address the\n
    \   above mentioned properties to improve RSVP-TE control plane\n    scalability.\n\n\t
