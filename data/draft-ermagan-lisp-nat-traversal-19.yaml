abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for IPv4 NAT traversal for LISP
    tunnel routers (xTR) and LISP Mobile Nodes (LISP-MN) behind a NAT device. A LISP
    device both detects the NAT and initializes its state. Forwarding to the LISP
    device through a NAT is enabled by the LISP Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR)
    network element, which acts as an anchor point in the data plane, forwarding traffic
    from unmodified LISP devices through the NAT.</p>"
