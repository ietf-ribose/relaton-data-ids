abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no capability negotiation done for Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) applications that setup Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for IP prefixes or that
    signal Point-to-point (P2P) Pseudowires (PWs) for Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks
    (L2VPNs). When an LDP session comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise
    its local state for such LDP applications even when the peer session is established
    for some other applications like Multipoint LDP (mLDP) or Inter-Chassis Communication
    Protocol (ICCP). This document defines a solution by which an LDP speaker announces
    to its peer its disinterest in such non-negotiated applications, thus disabling
    the unnecessary advertisement of corresponding application state, which would
    have otherwise be advertised over the established LDP session.</p>"
