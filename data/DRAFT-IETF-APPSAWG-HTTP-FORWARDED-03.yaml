abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that
    allows\n   proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying\n   process,
    e.g., the originating IP address of a request or IP number\n   of the proxy on
    the user-agent-facing interface.  Given a trusted\n   path of proxying components,
    this makes it possible to arrange so\n   that each subsequent component will have
    access to e.g., all IP\n   addresses used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests.\n\n
    \  This document also specifies guidelines for a proxy administrator to\n   anonymize
    the origin of a request.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
