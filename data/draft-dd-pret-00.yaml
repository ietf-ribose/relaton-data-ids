abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies new File Transfer Protocol (FTP)commands
    to allow for a distributed FTP server to operatecorrectly. The purpose is to address
    an issue in the FTPProtocol which causes a truely distributed FTP server frombeing
    possible. Truely distributed meaning that data-connections do not needto be routed
    through the FTP server, itself, to be transferredto the client, and allowing data
    to be stored completelyseparately from the FTP Server.Copyright Notice Copyright
