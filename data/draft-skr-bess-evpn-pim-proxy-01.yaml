abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Networks [RFC7432] are becoming prevalent
    in Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and Service Provider VPN applications.
    One of the goals that EVPN pursues is the reduction of flooding and the efficiency
    of CE-based control plane procedures in Broadcast Domains. Examples of this are
    Proxy ARP/ND and IGMP/MLD Proxy. This document complements the latter, describing
    the procedures required to minimize the flooding of PIM messages in EVPN Broadcast
    Domains, and optimize the IP Multicast delivery between PIM routers.</p>"
