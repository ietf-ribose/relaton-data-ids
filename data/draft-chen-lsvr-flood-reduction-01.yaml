abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    for flooding the link states on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete
    topology of a BGP-SPF domain, so that the amount of flooding traffic in the domain
    is greatly reduced. This would reduce convergence time with a more stable and
    optimized routing environment.</p>"
