abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching
    the\ncontext of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path can\nreduce
    the latency of handoff's between base stations or access points.\nNeighbor graphs
    capture the set of all potential mobility paths for a\nwireless network. Given
    any base station or access point, the set of all\npossible hand-offs can easily
    be determined by examining the neighbor\ngraph in either a distributed fashion
    (at each base station) or\ncentralized at the AAA server. This draft describes
    how the neighbor\ngraph algorithm works at both the base station and the AAA server.\n\n\t
