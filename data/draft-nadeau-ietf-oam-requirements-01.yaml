abstract:
  content: "<p>As transport of diverse traffic types such as voice, framerelay, and
    ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect,handle and diagnose control
    and data plane defects becomes critical.Detection and specification of how to
    handle those defects is notonly important because such defects may not only affect
    thefundamental operation of an MPLS network, but also because theymay impact SLA
    commitments for customers of that network.This Internet draft describes requirements
    for user and dataplane operations and management (OAM) for Multi-ProtocolLabel
    Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been gatheredfrom network operators
    who have extensive experience deployingMPLS networks, similarly some of these
    requirements haveappeared in other documents [Y1710]. This draft specifies OAMrequirements
    for MPLS, as well as for applications of MPLS suchas pseudowire voice and VPN
    services. Those interested in specificissues relating to instrumenting MPLS for
    OAM purposes are directedto [FRAMEWORK]</p>"
