abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed
    before\nthe Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little\nconsideration
    for protection of the information it carries.  There are\nno mechanisms in BGP
    to protect against attacks that modify, delete,\nforge, or replay data, any of
    which has the potential to disrupt overall\nnetwork routing behavior.\nThis internet
    draft discusses some of the security issues with BGP\nrouting data dissemination,
    and possible security solutions and the\ncosts of those solutions.  This internet
    draft does not discuss security\nissues with forwarding of packets.\n\n\t </p>\n
