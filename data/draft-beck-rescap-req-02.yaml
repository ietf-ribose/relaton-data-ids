abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on theInternet
    as a means of identifying various resources, services, anddestinations. However,
    a means of attaching a set of attributes orcharacteristics to a given resource
    identifier and subsequentlyassessing those attributes or characteristics has not
    been specifiedand deployed.A particularly important resolution service of this
    general type isone which, when given a mail address identifying a particular mailrecipient,
    will return a series of attributes describing thecapabilities of that recipient.
    This differs from a directoryservice in that no searching or other advanced query
    operations areinvolved.Two tasks are envisioned. The first task will be to define
    a generalresolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to alist
    of attributes. The second task will be to define anadministrative model and update
    protocol that can be used to setup and maintain the information the resolution
    protocol accesses.This document defines the requirements for these two protocols.</p>"
