abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer\n
    \  between endpoints.\n\n   A lot of applications are using TLS in order to set
    communications\n   between the applications end points.\n\n   As long as applications
    end points and transport end points were\n   combined into the same host, application
    authentication could be\n   combined with the transport authentication.\n\n   As
    the current internet is decoupling the transport and application\n   layers, such
    model may not be applicable anymore.  In other words,\n   TLS authentication cannot
    be handled on behalf of the application\n   authentication.\n\n   This document
    describes use cases where the authentication of the\n   transport layer differs
    from the authentication performed at the\n   application layer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
