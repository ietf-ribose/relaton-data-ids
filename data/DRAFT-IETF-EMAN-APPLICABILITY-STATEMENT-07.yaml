abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide
    an \n        energy management framework for networked devices.  This \n        document
    presents the applicability of the EMAN framework to a \n        variety of scenarios.
    \ This document lists use cases and target \n        devices that can potentially
    implement the EMAN framework and \n        associated SNMP MIB modules.  These
    use cases are useful for \n        identifying requirements for the framework
    and MIBs.  Further, \n        we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework
    to relevant \n        other energy monitoring standards and architectures. \n\t
