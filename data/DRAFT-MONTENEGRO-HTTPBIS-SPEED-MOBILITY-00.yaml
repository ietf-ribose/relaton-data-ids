abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The design of HTTP--how every application and service on the
    web\n   communicates today--can positively impact user experience,\n   operational
    and environmental costs, and even the battery life of the\n   devices you carry
    around.\n\n   Improving HTTP starts with speed.  Apps--not just browsers--should\n
    \  get faster too.  More and more, apps are how people access web\n   services,
    in addition to their browser.  Improving HTTP should also\n   make mobile better,
    particularly to ensure great battery life and low\n   network cost on constrained
    devices.  People and their apps should\n   stay in control of network access.
    \ Finally, to achieve rapid\n   adoption, HTTP 2.0 needs to retain as much compatibility
    as possible\n   with the existing Web infrastructure.  Done right, HTTP 2.0 can
    help\n   people connect their devices and applications to the Internet fast,\n
    \  reliably, and securely over a number of diverse networks, with great\n   battery
    life and low cost.\n\n   This document describes \"HTTP Speed+Mobility,\" a proposal
    for HTTP\n   2.0 that emphasizes performance improvements and security while at\n
    \  the same time accounting for the important needs of mobile devices\n   and
    applications.  The proposal starts from both the Google SPDY\n   protocol and
    the work the IETF has done around WebSockets.  The\n   proposal is not a final
    product but rather is intended to form a\n   baseline for working group discussion.\n\n\t
