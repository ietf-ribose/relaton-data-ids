abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding\n
    \  Detection (BFD) to allow the use of arbitrary cryptographic\n   authentication
    algorithms in addition to the already-documented\n   authentication schemes described
    in the base specification.  This\n   document adds the basic infrastructure that
    is required for\n   supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
