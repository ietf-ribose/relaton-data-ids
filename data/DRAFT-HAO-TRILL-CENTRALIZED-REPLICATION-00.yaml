abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue
    may\n   occur when pseduonode nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This\n
    \  draft is to solve RPF check failure issue through centralized\n   replication
    for BUM traffic solution. The basic idea is that all\n   ingress RBs send BUM
    traffic to a centralized node through unicast\n   TRILL encapsulation, the centralized
    node decapsulates the unicast\n   TRILL packet. Then the centralized node searches
    its multicast\n   forwarding table to replicates a copy of the BUM traffic to\n
    \  destination RBs through TRILL unicast encapsulation. Through\n   centralized
    replication solution, only unicast forwarding behavior is\n   required between
    edge RB and centralized RB, so no RPF check function\n   is required on any device
    in TRILL campus through centralized\n   replication solution and no RPF check
    failure issue occurs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
