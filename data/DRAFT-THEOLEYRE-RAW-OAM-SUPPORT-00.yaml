abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges
    to\n   achieve properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks.\n
    \  At the same time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires\n   and
    justify the extra effort of going wireless.  This document\n   presents some of
    these use-cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
