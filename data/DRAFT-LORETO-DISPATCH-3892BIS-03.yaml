abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP Referred-By header field conveys the referrer identity
    of a\n   request.  This header field may be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE\n
    \  or a SIP INVITE request to a pre-defined group URI and the\n   P-Asserted-Identity
    header field or From header field in the exploded\n   SIP requests needs to carry
    another value (e.g. the URI of a pre-\n   defined group, or a conference focus
    URI).  In those cases, the\n   Referred-By header field in the resulting exploded
    requests is set to\n   the P-Asserted-Identity or to the From header field value
    of the\n   original SIP request received before exploding, so as to convey to\n
    \  the receiver the identity of the original inviting sender.\n\n   RFC 3892 restricts
    the value of the header to only one SIP URI.\n   However the P-Asserted-Identity
    header field currently allows two URI\n   values and may be expanded in the future
    to carry more than two\n   values as described in RFC5876.  This document extends
    the\n   Referred-By definition to support more than one value as well.\n\n\t </p>\n
