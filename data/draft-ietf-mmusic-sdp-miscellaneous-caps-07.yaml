abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has been extended with a capability
    negotiation mechanism framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport
    protocols and attributes. This framework has been extended with a media capabilities
    negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related
    capabilities. This negotiation is embedded into the widely used SDP offer/answer
    procedures. This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
    endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities. In particular, this
    memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth ("b=" line), connection data
    ("c=" line), and session or media titles ("i=" line for each session or media).</p>
