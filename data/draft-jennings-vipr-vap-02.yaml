abstract:
- content: "<p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for
    inter-domain SIP federation. ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks, and SIP,
    and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP spam problems that
    have been a barrier to federation. The ViPR architecture uses a server, the ViPR
    server, which performs P2P and validation services on behalf of call agents, which
    acts as clients to the server. Such an architecture requires a client/server protocol
    between call agents and the ViPR server. That protocol, defined here, is called
    the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).</p>"
