abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The behavior of mail lists on the Internet has become \nmuch more
    sophisticated than the alias expanders \ndiscussed in the standards for Internet
    messages \nformats. The lack of standard behavior for this part of \nthe Internet
    messaging system creates confusion among \nusers, resulting in misdirected or
    inappropriately \nduplicated messages. This document lists required \nbehaviors
    for mail list managers derived from [RFC2821] \nand [RFC2822] in hopes of reducing
    the confusion, \nmisdirected and duplicated mail, while at the same time \nsimplifying
    the configuration process for mail list \nmanagers.\n\t </p>\n      "
