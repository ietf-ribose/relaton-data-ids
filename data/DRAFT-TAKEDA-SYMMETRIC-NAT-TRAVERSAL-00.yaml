abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric
    NATs\nwith STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will not\nyield
    a usable address for traversing symmetric NAT. The use of\nsymmetric RTP allows
    you to accompolish symmetric NAT traversal only\nin situations where the other
    end is open to the Internet, or has a\nfull-cone or a restricted-cone NAT.  This
    document proposes an\nanalytical method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailed\ncharacteristics
    of the symmetric NAT using STUN, and describes how we\ncan establish a peer-to-peer
    UDP connection even in situations where\nNATs (including symmetric NATs) are present
    at both ends.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
