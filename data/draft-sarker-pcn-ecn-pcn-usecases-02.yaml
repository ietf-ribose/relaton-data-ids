abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides an informative overview of possible use caseswhere
    ECN marking can be used for inelastic traffic. It outlinesbenefits of preserving
    the ECN support in a PCN domain. As ECNprovides with a simple mechanism for network
    nodes to inform the endpoints about possible upcoming congestion and resulting
    packet lossesand delay increase, the scheme can be useful for adaptive real-timemedia
    applications, thus enabling them to adjust the transmissionrate to avoid quality
    degradation due to congestion. By showing thebenefits of ECN this memo asks the
    working group to consider end toend ECN support in PCN domain.</p>"
