abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides use case studies and network design\n
    \  considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile\n   (MPLS-TP).\n\n
    \  In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice\n   for
    the new generation of packet transport. Many service providers\n   (SPs) are working
    to replace the legacy transport technologies, e.g.\n   SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM
    technologies, with MPLS-TP for packet\n   transport, in order to achieve higher
    efficiency, lower operational\n   cost, while maintaining transport characteristics.\n\n
    \  The use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro Ethernet access and\n   aggregation,
    Mobile backhaul, and packet optical transport. The\n   design considerations discussed
    in this documents ranging from\n   operational experience; standards compliance;
    technology maturity;\n   end-to-end forwarding and OAM consistency; compatibility
    with\n   IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor interoperability; and optimization\n   vs.
    simplicity design trade off discussion. The general design\n   principle is to
    provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport\n   solutions.\n\n\n\n\t
