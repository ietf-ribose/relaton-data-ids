abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document focuses on the Admission Control functionality performed\n\nby
    the Edge Router in the IntServ/DiffServ interworking scenario\n\ndescribed in
    [COPS-ISDS]. More precisely it describes the interaction\n\nbetween the RSVP and
    the COPS protocols in the Edge Router and\n\nintroduces an API (Application Programming
    Interface) aimed at allowing\n\nthe intercommunication between them. Anyway, the
    API described here is\n\ndesigned as a flexible interface, and should be able
    to support\n\ncommunication between a generic application and the COPS Client
    Type\n\ndescribed in [COPS-ODRA].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
