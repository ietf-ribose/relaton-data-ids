abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities\n
    \  designed to improve email confidentiality between a mail user agent\n   (MUA)
    and a mail submission or mail access server.  This provides\n   mechanisms intended
    to increase use of already deployed Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS) technology,
    provide a model for mail user\n   agent's confidentiality assurance, and enable
    mail service providers\n   to advertise improved TLS confidentiality facilities.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
