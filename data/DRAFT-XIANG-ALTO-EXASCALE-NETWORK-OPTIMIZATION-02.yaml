abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain,\n
    \  geographically-distributed, collaborative computing, where different\n   organizations
    contribute various resources to collaboratively\n   collect, share and analyze
    extremely large amounts of data.  Examples\n   of this paradigm include the Compact
    Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A\n   Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the
    Large Hadron\n   Collider (LHC) program.  Massive datasets continue to be acquired,\n
    \  simulated, processed and analyzed by globally distributed science\n   networks
    in these collaborations, and the volume of this data is\n   growing exponentially.
    \ Applications that manage and analyze such\n   massive data volumes can benefit
    substantially from the information\n   about networking, computing and storage
    resources from each member\n   sites, and more directly from network-resident
    services that optimize\n   and load balance resource usage among multiple data
    transfer and\n   analytic requests, and achieve a better utilization of multi-\n
    \  resources in clusters.  Hence this new paradigm calls for a framework\n   to
    manage a large set of distributively owned heterogeneous\n   resources, with the
    fundamental objective of efficient resource\n   utilization, following the autonomy
    and privacy of resource owners.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) protocol can\n   provide via extensions the network information about different\n
    \  clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network management\n   services
    where applicable, with the goal of improving both\n   application performance
    and network resource utilization.  However,\n   it has been verified in both science
    networks and commercial data\n   center networks that network resource in many
    cases is not the\n   bottleneck preventing the efficiency of large dataset transfer
    and\n   data-intensive analytics.  To achieve a greater overall efficiency of\n
    \  the science programs' workflows information about different\n   resources,
    such as computing, storage and networking, should be\n   provided to data intensive
    applications simultaneously.\n\n   In this document, we propose that it is feasible
    to use existing ALTO\n   services to provides not only network information, but
    also\n   information about computation and storage resources in data analytics\n
    \  networks.  We introduce a uniform resource orchestration framework\n   (Unicorn),
    which achieves an efficient multi-resource allocation to\n   support low-latency
    dataset transfer and data intensive analytics for\n   collaborative computing.
    \ Unicorn provides simple APIs for users to\n   submit and manage dataset transfer
    and analytic requests and to\n   monitor the status of each request, along with
    fine-grained local and\n   global network and site state information in real-time.
    \ It collects\n   cluster information from multiple ALTO services utilizing topology\n
    \  extensions and leverages emerging SDN control capabilities to\n   orchestrate
    the resource allocation for dataset transfers and\n   analytic tasks, leading
    to improved transfer and analytic latency as\n   well as more efficient utilization
    of multi-resources in clusters/\n   sites.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
