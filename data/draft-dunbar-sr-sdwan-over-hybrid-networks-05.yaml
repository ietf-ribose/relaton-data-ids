abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths
    to traverse specific list of underlay network segments, some of which can be private
    networks which include SR enabled segments, some of which can be the public IP
    networks that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E quality. The
    method described in this draft uses the principle of segment routing to enforce
    a SD-WAN path' head-end selected route traversing through a list of specific nodes
    of multiple network segments without requiring the nodes in each network segment
    to have the intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next
    domain.</p>"
