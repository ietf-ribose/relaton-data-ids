abstract:
- content: "<p>The Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks Working Group
    has been chartered to work on routing solutions for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) in various markets: industrial, commercial (building), home, and urban
    networks. Pursuant to this effort, this document defines the IPv6 routing requirements
    for building automation. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
