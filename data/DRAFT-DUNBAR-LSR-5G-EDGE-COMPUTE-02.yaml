abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Routers in 5G Local Data Network (LDN) can use additional\n
    \  site-costs, preference, and other application related\n   metrics on top of
    the network condition to compute\n   constraint-based SPF within the 5G LDN to
    enhance\n   performance for selected services. This draft describes\n   those
    application server related metrics to be used in\n   Flexible Algorithms.\n\n\t
