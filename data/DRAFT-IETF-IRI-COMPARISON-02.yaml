abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are Unicode strings\n
    \  used to identify resources on the Internet.  Applications that use\n   IRIs
    often define a means of comparing IRIs to determine when two\n   IRIs are equivalent
    for the purpose of that application.  Some\n   applications also define a method
    for canonicalizing an IRI --\n   translating one IRI into another which is equivalent
    under the\n   comparison method used.\n\n   This document gives guidelines and
    best practices for defining and\n   using IRI comparison and canonicalization
    methods.\n\n   Comparison methods are used to determine equivalence.  As URIs
    are a\n   subset of IRIs, the guidelines apply to URI comparison as well.\n\n\t
