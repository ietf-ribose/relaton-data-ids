abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The JSON Web Binding (JWB) describes a standardized approach
    to\n   implementing Web Services.  Services are advertised using the DNS SRV\n
    \  and HTTP Well Known Service conventions.  Messages may be\n   authenticated
    or authenticated and encrypted at the message layer in\n   addition to any transport
    and/or network layer security.  Service\n   messages are encoded in JSON using
    Internet time format for Date-Time\n   fields and Base64urlencoding for binary
    objects.\n\n   This document specifies Version 1.0 of JWB which uses HTTP/1.1
    for\n   transport.  Use of the multiple stream capabilities of HTTP/2 or QUIC\n
    \  is outside the scope of this document.\n\n   This document is also available
    online at\n   http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-json-web-\n   service.html
