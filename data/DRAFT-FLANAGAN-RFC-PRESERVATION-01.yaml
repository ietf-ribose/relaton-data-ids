abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for
    the RFC\n   Series.  This document applies specifically to the archivist role
    of\n   the RFC Editor.  It provides guidance on when and how to preserve\n   RFCs,
    and the tools required to view or re-create RFCs as necessary.\n   This document
    also highlights where gaps are in the current process,\n   and where compromises
    are suggested to balance cost with ideal best\n   practice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
