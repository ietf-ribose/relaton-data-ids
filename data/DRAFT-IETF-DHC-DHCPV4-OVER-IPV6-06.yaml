abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service
    for\n   some residual devices.  This document describes a mechanism for\n   allocating
    IPv4 addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6\n   transport.  It is
    done by putting a special relay agent function\n   (Client Relay Agent) on the
    client side, as well as extending the\n   behavior of the server; in the case
    where DHCP server only supports\n   IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended
    to support IPv6 transport\n   (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic
    for the server,\n   with a new Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry
    the IPv6\n   address of the Client Relay Agent.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
