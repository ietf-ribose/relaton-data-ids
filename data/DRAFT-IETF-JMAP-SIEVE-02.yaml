abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts
    on a\n   server using JMAP.\n\nOpen Issues\n\n   o  Should we introduce an \"isIncluded\"
    or \"isInUse\" filter/sort\n      condition for the /query method to locate scripts
    which are\n      included by others?\n\n   o  Do we need any (rate) limits for
    /test?\n\n   o  Should \":fcc\" and associated arguments (e.g., \":flags\",\n
    \     \":create\":, etc) reported in the /test response be in their own\n      \"fcc\"
    sub-object rather than listed inline with the rest of the\n      arguments for
    the action?\n\n\t </p>\n      "
