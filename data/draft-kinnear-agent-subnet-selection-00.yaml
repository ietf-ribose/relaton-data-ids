abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In RFC2131, the giaddr specifies both the subnet on which a DHCPclient
    resides as well as an IP address which can be used tocommunicate with the relay
    agent. The subnet selection option allowsthese functions of the giaddr to be split
    so that when one entity isperforming as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet
    from which toallocate an IP address which is different from the IP address withwhich
    it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.</p>"
