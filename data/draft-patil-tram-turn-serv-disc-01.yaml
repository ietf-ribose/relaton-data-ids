abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery mechanisms
    are relatively static and limited to explicit configuration. These are usually
    under the administrative control of the application or TURN service provider,
    and not the enterprise or the ISP, the network in which the client is located.
    Enterprises and ISPs wishing to provide their own TURN servers need auto discovery
    mechanisms that a TURN client could use with no or minimal configuration. This
    document describes two such mechanisms for TURN server discovery.</p>"
