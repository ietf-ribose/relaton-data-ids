abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial
    assess-\nment of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suite is to\nallow
    researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed TCP\nextensions in simulators
    and testbeds using a common set of well-\ndefined, standard test cases, in order
    to compare and contrast proposals\nagainst standard TCP as well as other proposed
    modifications. This test\nsuite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation
    of a pro-\nposed TCP modification or new congestion control mechanism. Instead,
    the\nfocus is on quickly and easily generating an initial evaluation report\nthat
    allows the networking community to understand and discuss the\nbehavioral aspects
    of a new proposal, in order to guide further experi-\nmentation that will be needed
    to fully investigate the specific aspects\nof a new proposal.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
