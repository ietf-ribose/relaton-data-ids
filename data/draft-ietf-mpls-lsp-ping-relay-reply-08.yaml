abstract:
- content: <p>In some inter autonomous system (AS) and inter-area deployment scenarios
    for RFC 4379 "Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and Traceroute", a replying LSR may
    not have the available route to the initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent
    to the initiator would be discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure
    of operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute. This document describes extensions to
    LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying Label Switching Router (LSR) to have
    the capability to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes
    to the initiator. This document updates RFC 4379.</p>
