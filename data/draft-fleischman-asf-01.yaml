    to store synchronized multimedia data. It supports data delivery over a wide variety

    supports advanced multimedia capabilities including extensible media types, component
    download, scaleable media types, author-specified stream prioritization, multiple
    language support, and extensive bibliographic capabilities, including document
    and content management.</p>"
