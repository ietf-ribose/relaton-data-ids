abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One of the major applications of the Session Initiation Protocol(SIP)
    is in Internet telephony. In this context it is often usefulor convenient for
    a SIP entity to request another SIP User Agentgenerate some type of tone, without
    generating this tone as part of asession. This document describes how SIP can
    be used withoutmodification to carry such tones and explores issues relating totheir
    use. Finally this document defines a new MIME type which isuseful for conveying
    computer generated tones.</p>"
