abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium. The wireless medium
    presents significant challenges to achieve deterministic properties such as low
    packet error rate, bounded consecutive losses, and bounded latency. This document
    defines the RAW Architecture. It builds on the DetNet Architecture and discusses
    specific challenges and technology considerations needed to deliver DetNet service
    utilizing scheduled wireless segments and other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing
    physical media resources with stochastic traffic.</p>"
