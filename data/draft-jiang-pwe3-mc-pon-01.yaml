abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS is being deployed deeper into operator networks, often to or past
    the access network node. Separately network access nodes such as PON OLTs have
    evolved to support first-mile access protection, where one or more physical OLTs
    provide first-mile diversity to the customer edge. Multi-homing support is needed
    on the MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services. This
    document describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture in MPLS and also
    proposes the ICCP extension to support it.</p>"
