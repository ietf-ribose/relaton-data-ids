abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network
    (OTN)\n   and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically\n
    \  deployed based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are\n   often
    managed using proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element\n   Management Systems
    (EMS), Network Management Systems (NMS) and\n   increasingly Software Defined
    Network (SDN) controllers.\n\n   A well-defined open interface to each domain
    management system or\n   controller is required for network operators to facilitate
    control\n   automation and orchestrate end-to-end services across multi-domain\n
    \  networks. These functions may be enabled using standardized data\n   models
    (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g., RESTCONF).\n\n   This document describes
    the key use cases and requirements for\n   transport network control and management.
    It reviews proposed and\n   existing IETF transport network data models, their
    applicability,\n   and highlights gaps and requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
