abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains the Basic Network Policy (BNP IM) Information\n
    \  Model which an instantiation and extension of the PCIM work (RFC3060,\n   RFC
    3460, RFC 3644) that supports both the configuration models and\n   the I2RS ephemeral
    models.  The PCIM work contains a Policy Core\n   Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060)
    and the Quality of Service (QoS)\n   Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644)
    and policy based routing.\n   The PCIM work provided a framework to incorporate
    ACL filters, prefix\n   filters, and more complex filters.  This extension to
    PCIM model\n   incorporate ACLs, Prefix-filtering, and complex policy (match,
    set,\n   modify, set) into the PCIM framework.  Complex policy is need by I2RS\n
    \  programmatic interface to BGP, flow specification filtering, Policy\n   Based
    Routing (PBR), MPLS topology management, and flow specification\n   filtering.\n\n\t
