abstract:
  content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) usesResource
    Reservation Protocol traffic engineering extensions(RSVP-TE) as the signaling
    protocol to establish Label Switched Paths(LSPs). Although the Resource Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) on whichRSVP-TE is built supports the convergence of traffic flows
    toward acommon destination, this concept has not been exploited in MPLS-TEwhich
    has been limited to point-to-point (P2P) andpoint-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.This
    document describes extensions to RSVP-TE procedures and protocolelements to support
    multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs.</p>"
