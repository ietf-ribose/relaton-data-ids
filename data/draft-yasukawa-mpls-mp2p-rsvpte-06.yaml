abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) uses Resource
    Reservation Protocol traffic engineering extensions (RSVP-TE) as the signaling
    protocol to establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs). Although the Resource Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) on which RSVP-TE is built supports the convergence of traffic
    flows toward a common destination, this concept has not been exploited in MPLS-TE
    which has been limited to point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    LSPs. This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE procedures and protocol elements
    to support multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs.</p>"
