abstract:
- content: "<p>To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit incoming
    requests, for example, based upon the source IP address. However, oblivious HTTP
    removes the ability for the server to distinguish amongst clients so the server
    can only rate-limit traffic from the oblivious relay. This harms all clients behind
    that oblivious relay. This specification enables a server to convey rate-limit
    information to an oblivious relay, which can use it to apply rate-limit policies
    on clients. Cooperating oblivious relays can thus provide more equitable service
    to their distinguishable clients without impacting on all clients behind that
    oblivious relay.</p>"
