abstract:
- content: "<p>To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit incoming
    requests, often based upon the source IP address. However, oblivious HTTP removes
    the ability for the server to distinguish amongst clients so the server can only
    rate-limit traffic from the oblivious proxy. This harms all clients behind that
    oblivious proxy. This specification provides feedback from a server to an oblivious
    proxy, enabling the oblivious proxy to rate-limit incoming requests from clients.
    Cooperating oblivious proxies can thus provide more equitable service to their
    distinguishable clients without triggering rate-limiting on the request resource
    or the target resource that would impact all clients behind that Oblivious proxy.</p>"
