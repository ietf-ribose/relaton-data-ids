abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a mechanism to specify a Segment Routing (SR)
    policy, as a collection of SR candidate paths. An SR policy is identified by &lt;headend,
    color, end-point&gt; tuple. An SR policy can contain one or more candidate paths
    where each candidate path is identified in PCEP via an PLSP-ID. This document
    proposes extension to PCEP to support association among candidate paths of a given
    SR policy. The mechanism proposed in this document is applicable to both MPLS
    and IPv6 data planes of SR.</p>"
