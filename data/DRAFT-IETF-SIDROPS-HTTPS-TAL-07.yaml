abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) for the
    Resource\n   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  TALs allow Relying Parties in
    the\n   RPKI to download the current Trust Anchor (TA) CA certificate from\n   one
    or more locations, and verify that the key of this self-signed\n   certificate
    matches the key on the TAL.  Thus, Relying Parties can be\n   configured with
    TA keys, but allow these TAs to change the content of\n   their CA certificate.
    \ In particular it allows TAs to change the set\n   of Internet Number Resources
    included in the RFC3779 extension of\n   their certificate.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes the previous definition of Trust Anchor\n   Locators in RFC 7730 by
    adding support for HTTPS URIs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
