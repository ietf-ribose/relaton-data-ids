abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal defines key management approaches for Quantum Safe Cryptographic
    (QSC) algorithms currently under evaluation in the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography
    (PQC) process. This includes key identification, key serialization, and key compression.
    The purpose is to provide guidance such that the adoption of quantum-safe algorithms
    is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of necessary key management standards.
    Early definition of key material standards will help expedite the adoption of
    new quantum safe algorithms at the same time as improving interoperability between
    implementations and minimizing divergence across standards.</p>"
