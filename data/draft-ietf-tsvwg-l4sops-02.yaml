abstract:
  content: "<p>This document is intended to provide guidance in order to ensure successful
    deployment of Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput (L4S) in the Internet.
    Other L4S documents provide guidance for running an L4S experiment, but this document
    is focused solely on potential interactions between L4S flows and flows using
    the original ('Classic') ECN over a Classic ECN bottleneck link. The document
    discusses the potential outcomes of these interactions, describes mechanisms to
    detect the presence of Classic ECN bottlenecks, and identifies opportunities to
    prevent and/or detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks. This guidance
    is aimed at operators of end-systems, operators of networks, and researchers.</p>"
