abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly
    connected to it on startup. Networks that are LANs or behave like a LAN, potentially
    create many PIM neighbors depending on how many routers are attached to it. If
    such a LAN is also a transit network (no directly connected source or receiver),
    many of the PIM procedures don't apply. This proposal describes a procedure to
    reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.</p>"
