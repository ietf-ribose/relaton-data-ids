abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the over-lay network solution by utilizing\n
    \  dynamically established IPsec multi-point Security Association (SA)\n   without
    individual connection.\n\n   Multi-point SA technology provides the simplified
    mechanism of the\n   Auto Discovery and Configuration function.  This is applicable
    for\n   any IPsec tunnels such as IPv4 over IPv4, IPv4 over IPv6, IPv6 over\n
    \  IPv4 and IPv6 over IPv6.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
