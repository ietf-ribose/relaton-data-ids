abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the 120 (Rated) Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP) response code. This response code enables calling parties to\n   learn
    an intermediary rated their call attempt.  Depending on\n   rating (e.g. Scam),
    the call may go unanswered. Through a 1xx code,\n   the caller's network may become
    aware future attempts to contact the\n   same User Agent Server (UAS) will likely
    go unanswered. The initial\n   use case driving the need for a 120 response code
    is when the\n   intermediary is an analytics engine. Code 120 (Rated) contrasts
    with\n   607 (Unwanted) &amp; 608 (Rejected) SIP response codes in which a human\n
    \  at target UAS, or terminating network analytics, indicate the call\n   may
    not completed.  This document also defines use of a Call-Info\n   header field
    in 120 (Rated) responses to enable negatively rated\n   callers to contact entities
    that rated their calls in error. This\n   provides a remediation mechanism for
    legal callers who find their\n   calls going unanswered (not necessarily blocked).\n\n\t
