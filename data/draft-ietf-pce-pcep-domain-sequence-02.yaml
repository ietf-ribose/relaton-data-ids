abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement
    for P2P and P2MP scenarios. In this context, a domain is a collection of network
    elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility
    such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems. This document specifies a standard
    representation and encoding of a Domain- Sequence, which is defined as an ordered
    sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain. This document also
    defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain identifiers.</p>"
