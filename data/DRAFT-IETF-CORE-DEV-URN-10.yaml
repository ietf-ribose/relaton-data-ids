abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\n
    \  for hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device\n   identity
    can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data\n   streams and storage,
    or equipment inventories.  A URN-based\n   representation can be passed along
    in applications that need the\n   information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
