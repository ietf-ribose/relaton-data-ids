abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is\n   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure
    to export such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more
    endpoints to connect to among large sets of\n   logically equivalent ones.  The
    primary use case for the ALTO\n   protocol was peer-to-peer applications for file
    sharing, video\n   streaming and realtime communications, usually running on end-user\n
    \  devices.  However, a number of other applications executing in more\n   controlled
    environments may also benefit from the information that\n   can be exported through
    the ALTO protocol.  The use cases that have\n   received significant attention
    include Content Delivery Networks\n   (CDNs), distributed applications running
    in large datacenters, as\n   well as systems made of inter-communicating ALTO
    servers.\n\n   To apply ALTO to these new use cases, this document aims to foster
    a\n   discussion to determine if, and how, the ALTO protocol could be\n   extended
    to provide a simple yet useful view of a computational\n   environment that goes
    beyond the static (or near static) network\n   topology and cost map information.\n\n\t
