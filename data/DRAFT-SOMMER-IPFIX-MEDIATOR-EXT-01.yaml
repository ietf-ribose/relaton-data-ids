abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPFIX supports the concept of a Mediator, a device that receives,\ntransforms,
    and exports data streams using IPFIX.  One of the most\nimportant requirements
    is the reduction of the volume of IPFIX\ntraffic by aggregating and discarding
    received information.  This\ndocument introduces a number of extensions to the
    IPFIX Information\nModel that support the export of aggregated IPFIX data, introducing\nabstract
    data types and Information Elements that optimize the\ntransport of descriptive
    information in terms of flow records' amount\nand size.  All extensions are directly
    applicable to the IPFIX\nMediator but can be used in many different applications
    as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
