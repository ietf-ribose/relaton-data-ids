abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an email induced Denial of Service threat\nfrom
    SPF script used to evaluate the association of a source domain-\nname with the
    sending-system.  The SPF script attempts to establish\nthe domain-name association
    through the construction of an extensive\nIP address list of all sending-systems.
    \ Expectations of an\nassociation have become problematic, as message handling
    might be\nnegatively affected without an apparent domain-name relationship\ndiscovered
    between the sending-system and either the message envelope\nor the message itself.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
