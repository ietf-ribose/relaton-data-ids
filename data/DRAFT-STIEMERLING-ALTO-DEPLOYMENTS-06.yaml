abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such
    as\npieces of information or server processes, which are available in\nseveral
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\nis not limited to,
    peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\nof Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\nguidance to these applications, which have
    to select one or several\nhosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide
    a desired\nresource.  The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working\ngroup.
    \ This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO for\npeer-to-peer and
    CDNs, some preliminary security considerations, and\nalso initial guidance for
    application designers using ALTO.\n\t </p>\n      "
