abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines context replication, an alternative to thecontext
    initialization procedure found in ROHC (Robust HeaderCompression) [RFC-3095].
    Profiles defining support for contextreplication may use the mechanism described
    herein to establish a newcontext based on another already existing context.Context
    replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of thecontext establishment procedure,
    and may be especially useful for thecompression of multiple short-lived flows
    that may be occurringsimultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as for example
    short-lived TCP flows.</p>"
