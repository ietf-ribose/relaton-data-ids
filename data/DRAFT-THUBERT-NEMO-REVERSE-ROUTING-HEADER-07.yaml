abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NEMO basic support enables Mobile Networks by extending Mobile
    IP to\n   Mobile Routers.  In the case of nested Mobile Networks, this involves\n
    \  the overhead of nested tunnels between the Mobile Routers and their\n   Home
    Agents, and causes a number of security issues.\n\n   This proposal alleviates
    those problems as well as other minor ones,\n   by using a source routing within
    the mobile nested structure,\n   introducing a new routing header, called the
    reverse routing header.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
