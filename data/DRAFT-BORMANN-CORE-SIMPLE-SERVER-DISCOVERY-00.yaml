abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking.\nMany
    applications also need a simple form of discovery for the\nservers carrying these
    resources.  This specification shows a simple\nway to extend the link-based resource
    discovery into a basic form of\nserver discovery.\n\nThe current version -00 of
    this document is just an initial draft\nthat is intended to spark discussion.\n\t
