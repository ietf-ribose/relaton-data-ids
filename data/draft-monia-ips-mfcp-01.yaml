abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes mFCP, a UDP-based [UDP] implementationof the
    iFCP Fibre Channel Protocol [iFCP] over metro- andlocal-scale IP networks. These
    networks are provisioned tohave latency, reliability, and performance levels comparable
    tothat of a Fibre Channel network. Storage devices use the FibreChannel SCSI mapping
    in [FCP] for data transport and errorrecovery. mFCP leverages these existing mechanisms
    tofacilitate high-performance interconnection of Fibre Channel-based storage devices
    over suitably provisioned IP networks. Asin the case of iFCP, fibre channel frames
    may be transportednatively over such a network without Fibre Channel switchingand
    routing elements.</p>"
