abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet-Draft describes an experimental protocol, MM-HOP,\nwhich
    was defined during the fall of 2000 and is currently being\nimplemented by ABNW.
    Using MM-HOP fast, state-preserving handovers\nbetween pico-cell wireless base-stations
    carrying IP traffic may be\nachieved.  This draft is NOT submitted to seamoby
    as candidate for\nany standard protocol, only as a record of a limited implementation\nof
    context transfer and micro-mobility support.\n\t </p>\n      "
