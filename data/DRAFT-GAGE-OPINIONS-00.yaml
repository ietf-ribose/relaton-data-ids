abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications
    in\nan IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise current\nconcepts
    of mobility, there is an industry need to support similar\nfunctions in non-cellular
    environments as well. Unfortunately,\nsolutions defined to-date by the cellular
    industry tend to be\nclosely tied to the technology employed over the radio link
    (e.g.\nGSM, cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE).\nTo facilitate discussion, this document begins
    with a high-level\ndescription of functional entities comprising an Open IP Network\nInfrastructure.
    It then defines an abstract model of the access link\nused to connect a mobile
    host to the network. Using these entities\nand model, we then go on to discuss
    the issues facing nomadic\ncomputing that could be usefully addressed by an IETF
    working group\nlike CRAPS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
