abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration,
    was\n   to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use\n
    \  service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately\n   that
    hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation\n   where all kinds
    of configuration options are added to RAs and DHCP.\n   This document proposes
    a new universal RA option in a self-describing\n   data format, with the list
    of elements maintained in an IANA\n   registry, with greatly relaxed rules for
    registration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
