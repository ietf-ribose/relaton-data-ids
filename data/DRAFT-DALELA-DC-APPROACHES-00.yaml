abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are many approaches to addressing virtualized datacenter\n
    \  scaling problems. Examples of these approaches include, L2 vs. L3\n   forwarding,
    host-based vs. network-based solutions, fat-access and\n   lean-core vs. fat-core
    and lean-access, flat addressing vs.\n   encapsulation, protocol learning vs.
    directories for location\n   discovery, APIs vs. protocols for orchestration,
    etc. Different\n   solutions being proposed today take one or more of these approaches\n
    \  in combination, although sometimes the question of approach itself\n   may
    not be settled. Given the multiple facets of the datacenter\n   problem, and many
    approaches to solve each problem, it becomes hard\n   to discuss a solution when
    some approaches may be acceptable while\n   others are not. This document discusses
    the pros and cons of various\n   approaches. The goal is not to describe a specific
    solution, but to\n   evaluate the various approaches. This document concludes
    with a set\n   of recommendations on which approaches are most optimal for a\n
    \  holistic solution to the entire problem set.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
