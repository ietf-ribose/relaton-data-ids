abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The \"Encoded Word\" conventions have been used extensively
    in email\n   headers and elsewhere to permit the encoding of non-ASCII characters\n
    \  where only ASCII ones are normally permitted.  The existing\n   specification
    defines only two kinds of encoding, one of which cannot\n   be understood easily
    by people and the other of which has been widely\n   discredited.  This document
    specifies a third encoding that is easily\n   accessible by users and much more
    closely tied to contemporary\n   practices.\n\n   The current version of the proposal
    is intended for possible\n   discussion in the EAI, IRI, and PRECIS WGs to see
    if it sheds light\n   on other issues being discussed in those WGs.  It is not,
    at this\n   point, proposed for adoption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
