abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current mechanisms used by Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
    to\n   secure the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) relies almost solely on\n
    \  public key cryptography (i.e.  Certificates and/or Cryptographically\n   Generated
    Addresses).  While these approaches provide very strong\n   guarantees on the
    authenticity of an IP address to link layer address\n   mapping, they are computationally
    expensive, which might be a problem\n   on resource-constrained devices.\n\n   It
    is also recognized in the SEND specification that it does not\n   compensate for
    an insecure link layer; more specifically, no\n   protections are offered against
    spoofing, link disruption, or bombing\n   DoS attacks launched at the link layer.
    \ Accordingly, this note\n   suggests an alternative to the current specification
    of SEND which\n   leverage on the deemed required link layer security to secure
    NDP.\n   This technique is based on the use of a specific kind of IPv6\n   addresses,
    the so-called Link Layer Hashed Based Addresses (LL-HBA),\n   and of link layer
    address reachability tests.\n\n   When the link layer security prevents attacker
    to redirect frames at\n   the link layer layer, this technique allows to provide
    some level of\n   security to NDP while relying solely on symmetric (i.e.,\n   computationally
    inexpensive) cryptography.\n\t </p>\n      "
