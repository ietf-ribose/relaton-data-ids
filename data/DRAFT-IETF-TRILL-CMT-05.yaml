abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL legacy\n
    \  networks via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs.\n   Appointed
    Forwarders provide load sharing based on VLAN with an\n   active-standby model.
    Mission critical operations such as High\n   Performance Data Centers require
    an active-active load sharing\n   model. The Active-Active load-sharing model
    can be accomplished by\n   representing any given non-TRILL legacy network with
    a single\n   virtual RBridge. Virtual representation of the non-TRILL legacy\n
    \  network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges in multi-\n   destination
    RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations. This\n   document specifies
    required enhancements to build Coordinated\n   Multicast Trees (CMT) within the
    TRILL campus to solve related RPF\n   issues. CMT provides flexibility to RBridges
    in selecting desired\n   path of association to a given TRILL multi-destination
    distribution\n   tree. This document updates RFC 6325.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
