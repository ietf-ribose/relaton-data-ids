abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
    designed\n   for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for
    the\n   ability to have basic security services defined for this data format.\n
    \  This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)\n   protocol.
    \ This specification describes how to create and process\n   signatures, message
    authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR\n   for serialization.  This specification
    additionally describes how to\n   represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.\n\n
    \  This document along with [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs] obsoletes\n   RFC8152.\n\n\t
