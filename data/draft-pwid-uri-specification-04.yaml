abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for Persistent
    Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' scheme name.
    The purpose of the standard is to support general, global, sustainable, humanly
    readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials
    in web archives in a way that can make them potentially resolvable. The PWID URI
    can assist in two ways: First, by providing potential resolvable precise and persistent
    reference scheme for web archive materials, which is not sufficiently covered
    by existing web reference practices and new suggested referencing methods. Second,
    to specify web elements in web collections (also known as web corpus) even for
    collections where there are references to web elements in several archives.</p>"
