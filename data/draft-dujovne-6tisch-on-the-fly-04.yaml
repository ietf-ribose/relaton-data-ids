abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
    of On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling, a Layer-3 mechanism for 6TiSCH networks. The purpose
    of OTF is to dynamically adapt the aggregate bandwidth, i.e., the number of reserved
    soft cells between neighbor nodes, based on the specific application constraints
    to be satisfied. When using OTF, softcell and bundle reservation is distributed:
    through the 6top interface, neighbor nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/deleted,
    with no intervention needed of a centralized entity. This document aims at defining
    a module which uses the functionalities provided by the 6top sublayer to (i) extract
    statistics and (ii) determine when to reserve/delete soft cells in the schedule.
    The exact reservation and deletion algorithm, and the number and type of statistics
    to be used in the algorithm are out of scope. OTF deals only with the number of
    softcells to be reserved/ deleted; it is up to 6top to select the specific soft
    cells within the TSCH schedule.</p>"
