abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio technologies
    and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP. The emerging
    Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) present a particular set of constraints,
    which places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense
    networks, delay- tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks. The main
    objectives of LP-WAN signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged messages,
    minimize the size of each message in a secure and extensible manner, all with
    keeping the fundamental principle of technology-independence (L2-independence).
    This document describes the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    as the main signaling protocol for LP-WAN, over which minimal messages are exchanged
    allowing the full operation of the network, such as authentication, authorization,
    and management. The use of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can
    be applied to different LP-WAN technologies.</p>"
