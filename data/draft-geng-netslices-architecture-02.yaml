abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the overall architecture of network slicing.
    Based on the general architecture, basic concepts of network slicing and examples
    of network slicing instances are introduced for clarification purposes. Some architectural
    considerations about the data plane, control plane, management and orchestration
    of network slicing are described to give a general view of network slicing implementation
    principles.</p>"
