abstract:
- content: "<p>This document records the issues discussed and the consensus reached
    in the Interdomain Routing (IDR) Working Group during its efforts to revise and
    bring up to date the base specification for the BGP-4 protocol as documented in
    RFC1771. The document focuses on the changes tracked from August 2002 when the
    last major push for revision began. The results of these efforts are encoded in
    RFC4271, which should be taken as normative for any of the issues that were discussed.
    The discussion here is intended to record how and why some of the changes to BGP
    were made.</p>"
