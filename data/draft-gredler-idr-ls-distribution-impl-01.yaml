- content: "<p>This document is an implementation report for the BGP Link-State Information
    Distribution protocol as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]. The editors

    are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
    considered authoritative for the implementations for which their responses represent.
    Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if the feature had at least
    been tested in the lab.</p>"
