abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a list of requirements for OSPF topology- transparent
    zone in a domain. A topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and
    a number of links connecting these routers. Any router outside of the zone is
    not aware of the zone. The information about the links and routers inside the
    zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone. Any link state change
    such as a link down inside the zone is not seen by any router outside of the zone.</p>"
