abstract:
- content: "<p>Upon link down event or link up event, each device in network individually
    schedules route calculation. Because of different hardware capabilities and internal/external
    environments, the time to update forwarding entries on these devices are disordered
    which can cause a transient forwarding loop. This document introduces a method
    to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link metric gradually for several times.</p>"
