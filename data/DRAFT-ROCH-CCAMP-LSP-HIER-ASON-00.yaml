abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control
    of\nhierarchical Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER].\nHowever, support
    of address separation as allowed by the\nAutomatically Switched Optical Network
    (ASON) architecture [G.8080]\nis not covered by [HIER]. This internet draft describes
    additional\nrequirements to consider for the use of LSP hierarchy in ASON\nnetworks
    and proposes extensions to address those requirements.\n\t </p>\n      "
