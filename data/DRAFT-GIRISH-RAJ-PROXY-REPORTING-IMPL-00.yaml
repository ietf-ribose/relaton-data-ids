abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document suggests a way for implementing a IGMP/MLD proxy-\n
    \  reporting switch in which reports received from downstream hosts \n   and queries
    received from upstream routers are used to build the \n   Subscription Aggregation
    table. Subscription Aggregation table can \n   be used for forwarding multicast
    data traffic, sending state change\n   and current state reports to upstream router
    ports. \n\t </p>\n      "
