abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol]
    specification has the role of defining a Group Key Agreement protocol, including
    all the cryptographic operations and serialization/deserialization functions necessary
    for scalable and secure group messaging. The MLS protocol is meant to protect
    against eavesdropping, tampering, message forgery, and provide further properties
    such as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS) in the case of
    past or future device compromises. This document describes a general secure group
    messaging infrastructure and its security goals. It provides guidance on building
    a group messaging system and discusses security and privacy tradeoffs offered
    by multiple security mechanisms that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g., frequency
    of public encryption key rotation). The document also provides guidance for parts
    of the infrastructure that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol document and
    left to the application or the infrastructure architects to design. While the
    recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow in order to interoperate
    at the protocol level, they affect the overall security guarantees that are achieved
    by a messaging application. This is especially true in case of active adversaries
    that are able to compromise clients, the delivery service, or the authentication
    service.</p>"
