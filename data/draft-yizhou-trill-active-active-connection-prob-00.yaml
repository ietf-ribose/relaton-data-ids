abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)_protocol
    provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid failover for both unicast
    and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology and link technology
    between TRILL switches. Active-active at the TRILL edge is the extension, in so
    far as practical, of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected
    to a TRILL campus. This informational document discusses some of the high level
    problems to be overcome in providing active-active at the TRILL edge.</p>"
