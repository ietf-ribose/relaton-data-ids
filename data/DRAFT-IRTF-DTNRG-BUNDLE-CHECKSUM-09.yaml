abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol includes a custody\n
    \  transfer mechanism to provide acknowledgements of receipt for\n   particular
    bundles.  No checksum is included in the basic DTN Bundle\n   Protocol, however,
    so at intermediate hops, it is not possible to\n   verify that bundles have been
    either forwarded or passed through\n   convergence layers without error.  Without
    assurance that a bundle\n   has been received without errors, the custody transfer
    receipt cannot\n   guarantee that a correct copy of the bundle has been transferred,
    and\n   errored bundles are forwarded when the destination cannot use the\n   errored
    content, and discarding the errored bundle early would have\n   been better for
    performance and throughput reasons.  This document\n   addresses that situation
    by defining new ciphersuites for use within\n   the existing Bundle Security Protocol's
    Payload Integrity Block\n   (formerly called the Payload Security Block [ED: remove
    old name\n   before RFC]) to provide error-detection functions that do not require\n
    \  support for other, more complex, security-providing ciphersuites that\n   protect
    integrity against deliberate modifications.  This creates the\n   checksum service
    needed for error-free reliability, and does so by\n   separating security concerns
    from the few new reliability-only\n   ciphersuite definitions that are introduced
    here.  The reliability-\n   only ciphersuites given here are intended to protect
    only against\n   errors and accidental modification; not against deliberate integrity\n
    \  violations.  This document discusses the advantages and disadvantages\n   of
    this approach and the existing constraints that combined to drive\n   this design.\n\n\t
