abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol is used
    to manage code and configuration data in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
    This document specifies the HTTP transport for TEEP communication where a Trusted
    Application Manager (TAM) service is used to manage code and data in TEEs on devices
    that can initiate communication to the TAM. An implementation of this document
    can (if desired) run outside of any TEE, but interacts with a TEEP implementation
    that runs inside a TEE.</p>"
