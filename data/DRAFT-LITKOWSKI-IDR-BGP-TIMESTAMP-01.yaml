abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP is more and more used to transport routing information
    for\n   critical services.  Some BGP updates may be critical to be received\n
    \  as fast as possible : for example, in a layer 3 VPN scenario where a\n   dual-attached
    site is loosing primary connection, the BGP withdraw\n   message should be propagated
    as fast as possible to restore the\n   service.  The same criticity exists for
    other address-families like\n   multicast VPNs where \"join\" messages should
    also be propagated very\n   fast.\n\n   Experience of service providers shows
    that BGP path propagation time\n   may vary depending on network conditions (especially
    load of BGP\n   speaker on the path) and too long propagation time are affecting\n
    \  customer service.\n\n   It is important for service providers to keep track
    of BGP updates\n   propagation time to monitor quality of service for the customers.
    \ It\n   is also important to be able to identify BGP Speakers that are\n   slowing
    down the propagation.\n\n   This document presents a solution to transport timestamps
    of a BGP\n   path.  The solution is targeted to be used using special identified\n
    \  beacon prefixes that are single-homed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
