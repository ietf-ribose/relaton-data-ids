abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centers may have many links between each other. Bandwidth over-
    provisioning sometimes is not a good solution to accommodate the traffic between
    DCs, especially for peak traffic. This draft analyze the use case of inter DC
    traffic optimization, and the applicability of SUPA for this case.</p>"
