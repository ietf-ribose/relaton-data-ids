abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally, there needs
    to\nbe a mechanism that allows for unsigned RRsets in a secure zone.\nIn the current
    definition of DNSSEC [RFC 2535], it is allowed to\nhave 2 types of unsigned records,
    i.e. glue address RRsets and\ndelegation point NS RRsets. There exists several
    reasons to\nallow other unsigned RRsets, all related to the scalability and\nmaintenance
    of a secure zone.\n\t </p>\n      "
