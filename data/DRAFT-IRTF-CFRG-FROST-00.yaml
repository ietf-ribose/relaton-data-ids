abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft, we present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized
    Schnorr\n   Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during\n
    \  signing operations while protecting against forgery attacks\n   applicable
    to prior similar threshold and multisignature\n   constructions.\n\n   FROST can
    be safely used without limiting concurrency of signing\n   operations yet allows
    for true threshold signing, as only a threshold\n   number of participants are
    required for signing operations.  Here, we\n   define FROST as a two-round protocol,
    but it can be optimized to a\n   single-round single-round signing protocol as
    the first round can be\n   performed as a batched pre-processing stage.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
