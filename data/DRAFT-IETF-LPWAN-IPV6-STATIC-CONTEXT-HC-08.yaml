abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation\n
    \  functionality for very low bandwidth networks.  These techniques are\n   specially
    tailored for Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).\n\n   The Static Context Header
    Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of\n   flexibility when processing the
    header fields.  SCHC compression is\n   based on a common static context stored
    in a LPWAN device and in the\n   network.  Static context means that the stored
    information does not\n   change during packet transmission.  The context describes
    the field\n   values and keeps information that will not be transmitted through
    the\n   constrained network.\n\n   SCHC must be used for LPWAN networks because
    it avoids complex\n   resynchronization mechanisms, which are incompatible with
    LPWAN\n   characteristics.  And also, because with SCHC, in most cases IPv6/UDP\n
    \  headers can be reduced to a small identifier called Rule ID.  Even\n   though,
    sometimes, a SCHC compressed packet will not fit in one L2\n   PDU, and the SCHC
    fragmentation protocol defined in this document may\n   be used.\n\n   This document
    describes the SCHC compression/decompression framework\n   and applies it to IPv6/UDP
    headers.  This document also specifies a\n   fragmentation and reassembly mechanism
    that is used to support the\n   IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN technologies.
    \ Fragmentation is\n   mandatory for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression
    or when it\n   has not been possible to apply such compression, still exceed the
    L2\n   maximum payload size.  Similar solutions for other protocols such as\n
    \  CoAP will be described in separate documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
