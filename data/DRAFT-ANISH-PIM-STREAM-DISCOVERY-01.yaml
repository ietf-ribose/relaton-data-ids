abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification introduces a mechanism in PIM-SM [RFC4601]
    for the\n   Last-Hop-Router (LHR) router to discover the stream information.\n
    \  Once this mechanism is available the complications of the shared tree\n   procedures
    can be avoided.\n\n   The document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport
    for the\n   information about multicast streams active in the network.\n\n   This
    specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms\n   defined by PIM
    Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559].  This is simply a\n   means to transmit reliable
    PIM messages and does not require the\n   support for Join/Prune messages over
    PORT as defined in [RFC6559].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
