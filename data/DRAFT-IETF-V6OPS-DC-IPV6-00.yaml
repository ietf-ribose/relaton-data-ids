abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to provide operational guidelines
    for\n   datacenter operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their\n   infrastructures.
    \ It aims to offer a reference framework for\n   evaluating different products
    and architectures, and therefore it is\n   also addressed to manufacturers and
    solution providers, so they can\n   use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe
    this will translate in a\n   smoother and faster IPv6 transition for datacenters
    of these\n   infrastuctures.\n\n   The document focuses on the DC infrastructure
    itself, its operation,\n   and the aspects related to DC interconnection through
    IPv6.  It does\n   not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet
    services\n   provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6\n
    \  beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the\n   Data
    Center (DC) infrastructure.\n\n   Apart from facilitating the transition to IPv6,
    the mechanisms\n   outlined here are intended to make this transition as transparent
    as\n   possible (if not completely transparent) to applications and services\n
    \  running on the DC infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of\n   IPv6
    features to simplify DC operations, internally and across the\n   Internet.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
