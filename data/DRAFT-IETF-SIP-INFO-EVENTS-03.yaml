abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the new SIP INFO method and a mechanism
    for\ndefining, negotiating and exchanging Info Packages that use the INFO\nmethod.
    \ Applications that need to exchange session-related\ninformation within a SIP
    INVITE-created dialog, also known as\napplication level information, use these
    INFO requests.  This draft\naddresses issues and open items from RFC 2976 and
    replaces it.\n\nConventions Used in this Document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\nThe terminology in this document conforms to the Internet
    Security\nGlossary [RFC4949].\n\nBe mindful of the terms User Agent Server (UAS)
    and User Agent Client\n(UAC).  This document strictly follows RFC 3261 [RFC3261].
    \ The UAC\nissues a SIP request and the UAS responds.  This terminology may be\nconfusing
    when one combines the INFO case with the INVITE case.  For\nan INVITE, the initiator
    of the session is the UAC and the target of\nthe session is the UAS.  However,
    it is possible for the target UA of\nthe session, the UAS of the INVITE transaction,
    to send an INFO to\nthe initiating UA of the session, the UAC of the INVITE transaction.\nFrom
    the perspective of the INFO, the target UA of the session\n(INVITE UAS) is, in
    fact, the UAC (sender) of the INFO request.\nLikewise, from the perspective of
    the INFO, the initiating UA of the\nsession (INVITE UAC) is the UAS (recipient)
    of the INFO request.\nSince this document strictly follows RFC 3261, we refer
    to the UA\nthat issues the INVITE as the \"initiating UA\" and the UA that\nresponds
    to the INVITE as the \"target UA\" to remove any confusion.\n\t </p>\n      "
