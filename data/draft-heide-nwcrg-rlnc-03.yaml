abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a symbol representation for Random Linear Network
    Coding (RLNC) schemes used for reliable data transfer. Specifically, the following
    features are discussed and incorporated: both block RLNC and a sliding window
    RLNC, varying data frame sizes, and one or multiple symbols associated with a
    single symbol representation header.</p>"
