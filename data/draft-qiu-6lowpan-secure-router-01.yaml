abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wirelesssensor
    network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routingpath and neighborhood
    keep changing. In order to provide a highlevel of security in this environment,
    the moving sensor node needsto be authenticated to new neighboring nodes as well
    as to establisha key for secure communication. The document proposes an efficientand
    scalable protocol to establish and update the secure key in adynamic wireless
    sensor network environment. The protocol guaranteesthat two sensor nodes share
    at least one key with probability 1(100%) with less memory and energy cost, while
    not causingconsiderable communication overhead.</p>"
