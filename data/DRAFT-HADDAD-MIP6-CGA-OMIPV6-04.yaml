abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo suggests a new and enhanced route optimization security\n
    \  mechanism for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6).  The primary motivation for this\n   new
    mechanism is the reduction of signaling load and handoff delay.\n   The performance
    improvement achieved is elimination of all signaling\n   while not moving, and
    33% of the per-movement signaling.\n\t </p>\n      "
