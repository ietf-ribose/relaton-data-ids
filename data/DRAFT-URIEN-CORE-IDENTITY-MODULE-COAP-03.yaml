abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines identity modules based on Secure Elements\n
    \  processing DTLS/TLS stacks for CoAP devices. The expected benefits\n   of these
    secure microcontrollers are the following :\n   - Secure storage of pre-share
    keys or private keys\n   - Trusted simple or mutual authentication between CoAP
    devices and\n   CoAP clients.\n   - The device identity is enforced by a non cloneable
    chip.\n   - Trusted cryptographic support.\n   - Low power consumption for DTLS/TLS
    processing.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
