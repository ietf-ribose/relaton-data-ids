abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Transport networks that provide connectivity and bandwidth
    for\n   customer services have typically been static, lacking\n   flexibility,
    and requiring long planning times when deploying new\n   services. Network Providers
    and Service Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow separation of
    data plane and control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path setup and protection,
    and centralized\n   path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.\n
    \  Although these technologies provide significant benefits, they do\n   not meet
    the growing need for network programmability, automation,\n   resource sharing,
    and service elasticity necessary to meet\n   operators' requirements for virtual
    network operation.\n\n   Virtual network operation refers to the creation of a\n
    \  virtualized environment allowing operators to view the\n   abstraction of the
    underlying multi-administration, multi-\n   vendor, multi-technology networks
    and to operate, control, and\n   manage these multiple networks as if a single
    virtualized network.\n   Another dimension of virtual network operation is the
    use of\n   common core transport network resources by multi-tenant service\n   networks
    as a way of providing a virtualized infrastructure to\n   flexibly offer new services
    and applications.\n\n   The work effort investigating this problem space is known
    as\n   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). This\n   document
    provides an ACTN problem description, a scope of work,\n   and outlines the core
    objectives and requirements to facilitate\n   virtual network operation.\n\n\n\t
