abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based
    \nlocalized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for \nregistration,
    de-registration and handover into account in the first \nprotocol release. When
    a mobile node connects to the access networks \nthrough a sole interface or multiple
    interfaces, the condition of the \naccess networks should be considered to improve
    the performance of \nthe ongoing applications. According to the normal operation,
    Local \nMobility Anchor (LMA) can not get enough information to do the \nnecessary
    scheduling with Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Mobile Node \n(MN), such as flow
    distribution. This document defines a PMIPv6 extension that carries network condition
    in the form of simple class \nindication which is calculated and sent from MAG
    to LMA in the Access \nTechnology Type option. \n\n      \n      \n\t </p>\n      "
