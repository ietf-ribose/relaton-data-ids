abstract:
  content: "\t <t>To date, a number of authentication protocols have been proposed
    forMobile-IP. Among these incompatible protocols, it is not clearuntil now which
    one will be the preferred one for global deploymentof Mobile-IP. Based on the
    policy of allowing various protocolsto co-exist, this draft specifies an authentication
    framework thatallows Mobile-IP entities to negotiate for a protocol to be employed.The
    framework also outlines the utilization of message extensionfor carrying all information
    required by the authentication protocolbeing used.Based on the proposed framework,
    this draft then proposes a 'MinimalPublic Key Based Authentication' which addresses
    the need forscalable but lightweight authentication protocol. The proposedprotocol
    secures the registration process, and requires a number ofmessage rounds that
    is fully compatible with the base Mobile-IP.</p>"
