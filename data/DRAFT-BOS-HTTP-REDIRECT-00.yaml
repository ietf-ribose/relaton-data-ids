abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The HTTP 1.1 specification describes how a server can answer a\nrequest
    with a redirection, instructing the client to get the\nresource from a different
    URL. It doesn't explain what to do with any\nfragment identifier that might have
    been on the original URL, and\nthis omission has resulted in different clients
    handling fragments in\ndifferent ways. This draft gives rules towards a more consistent\nhandling
    by future HTTP clients.\n\t </p>\n      "
