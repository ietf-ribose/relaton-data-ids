abstract:
- content: "<p>The Web Real-Time Communication [WebRTC] working group is charged to
    provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication using audio,
    video and data between two peers' web browsers. With in the WebRTC framework,
    Session Description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating session capabilities
    between the peers. Such a negotiation happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer exchange
    mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264]. This document provides an informational
    reference in describing the role of SDP and the Offer/Answer exchange mechanism
    for the most common WebRTC use-cases. This SDP examples provided in this document
    is still a work in progress, but it aims to align closest to the evolving standards
    work.</p>"
