abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP
    [RFC4828], a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets.
    The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second
    (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same
    level of congestion. CCID 4 is for experimental use for senders that send small
    packets and would like a TCP-friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.</p>"
