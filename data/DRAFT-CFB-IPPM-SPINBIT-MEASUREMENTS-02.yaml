abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces an additional single bit signal to
    enhance\n   the spin bit [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin] performance in presence of\n
    \  network impairments and application limited flow.  In addition, it\n   defines
    two new explicit per-flow transport-layer signals for hybrid\n   measurement of
    connection loss rate.  The former is a spin-bit\n   dependent signal and uses
    a single bit.  The latter is a standalone\n   solution based on a two bits loss
    signal and on alternate marking RFC\n   8321 [RFC8321].\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
