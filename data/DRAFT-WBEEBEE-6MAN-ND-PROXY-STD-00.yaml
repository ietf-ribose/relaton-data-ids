abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Increasingly the need for IPv6 ND Proxy [RFC4389]) to be a Standards\nTrack
    document is growing.  During the specification of the IPv6 CE\nRouter in the IETF
    v6ops Working Group, the IPv6 CE Router has use\nfor ND Proxy to bridge disparate
    MAC layers LAN ports.  There is also\nthe use of ND Proxy in cable broadband NBMA
    network for DAD and ND\naddress resolution on a cable access concentrator.  Another
    case\nwhere ND Proxy is required is when one does not have enough IPv6\naddress
    space to route.  This short note recommends that the ND Proxy\nRFC be changed
    to a Standards Track document.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is
