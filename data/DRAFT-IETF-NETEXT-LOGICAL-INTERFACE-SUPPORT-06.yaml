abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the
    host\n   operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular\n   operating
    systems and is used in various protocol implementations.\n   The Logical Interface
    support is required on the mobile node\n   operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain,
    for leveraging various\n   network-based mobility management features such as
    inter-technology\n   handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document\n
    \  explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and\n   the
    specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical\n   interfaces
    from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the\n   attached access networks.
    \ Furthermore, this document identifies the\n   applicability of this approach
    to various link-layer technologies and\n   analyzes the issues around it when
    used in context with various\n   mobility management features.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
