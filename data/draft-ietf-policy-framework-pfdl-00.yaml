abstract:
  content: "<p>Recently, the IETF has developed protocols that classify packets inorder
    to treat certain classes or flows of packets in a particularway compared to other
    classes or flows of packets. The successfulwide-scale deployment of these protocols
    depends on the ability toadminister and distribute consistent policy information
    to differenttypes of network devices as well as hosts and servers that participatein
    policy decision making, administration, distribution and control.There is a clear
    need to develop a scalable framework for policyadministration and distribution
    that will enable interoperabilityamong multiple devices and device types that
    must work together toachieve a consistent implementation of policy.This document
    defines a language, called the Policy FrameworkDefinition Language (PFDL), that
    maps requirements for services to beprovided by the network as defined in a business
    specification (e.g.,an SLA) to a common vendor- and device-independent intermediate
    form.This enables policy information and specifications to be shared amongthe
    heterogeneous components that comprise the policy framework, andallows multiple
    vendors to use multiple devices to implement thatframework. The PFDL is the common
    'currency' that is exchanged betweenthese heterogeneous components to enable them
    all to perform theirfunction in providing, securing, distributing, and administeringpolicy.
    The PFDL becomes the way to ensure that multiple vendorsinterpret the policy the
    same way while enabling vendors to providevalue-added services.</p>"
