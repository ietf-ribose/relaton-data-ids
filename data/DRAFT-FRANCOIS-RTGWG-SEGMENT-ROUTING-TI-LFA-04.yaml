abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate
    Fast\nRe-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing protection of node and\nadjacency
    segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This\nFast Re-route (FRR)
    behavior builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being\nLFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and
    remote LFAs with directed forwarding\n(DLFA).  It extends these concepts to provide
    guaranteed coverage in\nany IGP network.  A key aspect of TI-LFA is the FRR path
    selection\napproach establishing protection over post-convergence paths from the\npoint
    of local repair, dramatically reducing the operational need to\ncontrol the tie-breaks
    among various FRR options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
