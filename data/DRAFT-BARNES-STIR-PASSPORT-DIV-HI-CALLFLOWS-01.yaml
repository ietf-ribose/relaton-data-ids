abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document focuses on use cases and call flows which include
    the\n   History-Info header field and a SIP Identity header field with a\n   PASSport
    with a \"div\" claim in cases of retargeting.  These use cases\n   are derived
    from those provided in the SIP History-Info call flows\n   document.  The objective
    is to describe the optimal way to correlate\n   the History-Info header fields
    with a PASSporT with diversion\n   information to increase the level of confidence
    in the History-Info\n   header field by the terminating entity making use of the
    information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
