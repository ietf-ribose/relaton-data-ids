abstract:
- content: "<p>The generation of BGP adj-rib-in, local-rib or adj-rib-out comes from
    BGP route exchange and route policy processing. BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    provides the monitoring of BGP adj-rib-in [RFC7854], BGP local-rib [RFC9069] and
    BGP adj-rib-out [RFC8671]. By monitoring these BGP RIB's the full state of the
    network is visible, but how route-policies affect the route propagation or changes
    BGP attributes is still not. This document describes a method of using BMP to
    record the trace data on how BGP routes are (not) changed under the process of
    route policies.</p>"
