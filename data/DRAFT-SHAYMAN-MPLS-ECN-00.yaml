abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We propose the addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    \ntogether with congestion signaling back to the ingress in order to \nprovide
    notification to the ingress label switching router (LSR) if \ncongestion is experienced
    along a label switched path (LSP). This \ninformation could be used by the ingress
    LSR to mitigate congestion \nby employing dynamic traffic engineering techniques
    such as shifting \nflows to alternate paths.\n\t </p>\n      "
