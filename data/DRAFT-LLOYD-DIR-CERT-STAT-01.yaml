abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the
    X.500\ninformation schema and matching rules to support Certificate path\n processing,
    certificate status and CRL mechanisms. These\n enhancements provide advantages
    over existing Certificate validation\n and CRL mechanisms.  In particular, the
    mechanisms proposed can:\n \n(a) reduce the need for unnecessarily fetching CRLs;\n(b)
    allow certificate status-CRL evaluation time to be improved;\n(c) provide a directory
    supported certificate test and fetch\n    capability;\n(d) better support use
    of certificates in multiple environments with\n    different CRL arrangements.\n(e)
    simplify the client software in the areas of certificate path,\n    certificate
    validity and CRL processing.\n(f) provide the client a range of trust options
    when validating\n    certificates.\n(g) provide a range of implementation options
    so that gradual adoption\n    is possible.\n \nThis document is submitted for
    consideration as the basis of possible\nfuture IETF/ITU standardization.  Please
    send comments on this\ndocument to the ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.\n\n\t </p>\n
