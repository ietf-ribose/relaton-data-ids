abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, there are transport applications that have specific\n
    \  demands on a communication network. This document describes the APONF\n   basic
    architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main APONF\n   architecture entity
    is the Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD),\n   which supports groups/classes
    of application models. Each of these\n   models supports application demands that
    are similar in nature and\n   therefore can be grouped/classified together. Moreover,
    the ABPD maps\n   the classified application models into network capabilities,\n
    \  e.g., network management and traffic policies.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
