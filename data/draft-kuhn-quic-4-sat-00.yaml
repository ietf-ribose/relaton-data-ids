abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC's congestion control is not designed for operating over an Internet
    path with a high BDP. This limits the user experience. Moreover, a path can combine
    satellites network segment together with a wide variety of other network technologies
    (Ethernet, cable modems, WiFi, cellular, radio links, etc): this complicates the
    characteristics of the end-to-end path. If this is not addressed, the end-to-end
    quality of experience will be degraded. This memo identifies the characteristics
    of a SATCOM link that impact the operation of the QUIC transport protocol and
    proposes best current practice to ensure acceptable protocol performance.</p>"
