abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines problem statements for the Softwire Working Group
    to solve. At the highest level, the softwire WG is tasked to identify, and extend
    where necessary, standard protocols to support a selected set of IPv4 in IPv6
    and IPv6 in IPv4 transition problems. This document describes the distinct problems
    that will be solved as part of a solution phase following the completion of this
    document. Some individual requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified
    in this document at times in order to better describe the specific scope for a
    given problem definition.</p>"
