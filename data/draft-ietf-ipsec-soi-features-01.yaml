abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes many features of the proposals for the successorto
    IKEv1. The purpose of the document is to help the IPsec Working Groupdecide which
    features they want for the next protocol. The documentfocuses on how those features
    are instantiated in two proposals, IKEv2and JFK, but other ideas for features
    and options are also included.Most of the material in this document comes from
    many of the authors ofthe JFK and IKEv2 proposals.This document is meant to help
    the Working Group choose which featuresit finds important for the successor to
    IKE. It should be short-livedand is not expected to become an RFC.This document
