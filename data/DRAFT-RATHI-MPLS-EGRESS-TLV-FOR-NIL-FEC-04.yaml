abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS ping and traceroute mechanism as described in RFC 8029
    and\n   related extensions for SR as defined in RFC 8287 is very useful to\n   precisely
    validate the control plane and data plane synchronization.\n   All intermediate
    nodes may not have been upgraded to support\n   validation procedures.  A simple
    mpls ping and traceroute mechanism\n   comprises of ability to traverse any path
    without having to validate\n   the control plane state.  RFC 8029 supports this
    mechanism with Nil\n   FEC.  The procedures described in RFC 8029 are mostly applicable
    when\n   the Nil FEC is used as intermediate FEC in the label stack.  When all\n
    \  labels are represented using Nil FEC, it poses some challenges.\n\n   This
    document introduces new TLV as additional extension to exisiting\n   Nil FEC and
    describes mpls ping and traceroute procedures using Nil\n   FEC with this additional
    extensions to overcome these challenges.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
