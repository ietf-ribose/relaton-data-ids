abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies have been proposed, such
    as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on. A CPE may support some of them instead of only one.
    But the ISPs always support different kinds of transition technologies, such as
    Dual-Stack, DS-lite and so on. So they must control all the CPEs to match the
    exact transition tech through some standard messages. When the ISP network uses
    NFV, the message communication will between the network gateway and the V-CPE
    to configure the IPv6 transition technology in CPE.</p>"
