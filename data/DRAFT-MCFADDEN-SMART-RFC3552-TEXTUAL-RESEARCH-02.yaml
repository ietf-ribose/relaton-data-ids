abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC3552] provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text
    on\n   Security Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old.\n   With
    the threat landscape and security ecosystem significantly\n   changed since the
    RFC was published, RFC3552 is a candidate for\n   update. This draft proposes
    that, prior to drafting an update to\n   RFC3552, an examination of recent, published
    Security Considerations\n   sections be carried out as a baseline for how to improve
    RFC3552. It\n   suggests a methodology for examining Security Considerations\n
    \  sections in published RFCs and the extraction of both quantitative\n   and
    qualitative information that could inform a revision of the\n   older guidance.
    It also reports on a recent experiment on textual\n   analysis of sixteen years
    of RFC Security Consideration sections.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
