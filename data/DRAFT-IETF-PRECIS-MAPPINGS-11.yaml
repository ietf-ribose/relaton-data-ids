abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The framework for preparation, enforcement, and comparison
    of\n   internationalized strings (\"PRECIS\") defines several classes of\n   strings
    for use in application protocols.  Because many protocols\n   perform case-sensitive
    or case-insensitive string comparison, it\n   necessary to define methods for
    case mapping.  In addition, both the\n   Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) and the PRECIS\n   problem statement describe mappings for internationalized
    strings\n   that are not limited to case, but include width mapping and mapping\n
    \  of delimiters and other special characters that can be taken into\n   consideration.
    \ This document provides guidelines for designers of\n   PRECIS profiles and describes
    several mappings that can be applied\n   between receiving user input and passing
    permitted code points to\n   internationalized protocols.  In particular, this
    document describes\n   both locale-dependent and context-depending case mappings
    as well as\n   additional mappings for delimiters and special characters.\n\n\t
