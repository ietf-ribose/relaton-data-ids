abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the Privacy Pass protocol.  This protocol\n
    \  provides anonymity-preserving authorization of clients to servers.\n   In particular,
    client re-authorization events cannot be linked to any\n   previous initial authorization.
    \ Privacy Pass is intended to be used\n   as a performant protocol in the application-layer.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
