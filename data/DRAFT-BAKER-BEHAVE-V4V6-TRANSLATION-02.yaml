abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMP\nTranslation
    Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765.  The algorithm\ntranslates between IPv4
    and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMP\nheaders).\n\nThis specification addresses
    both a stateless and a stateful mode.\nIn the stateless mode, translation information
    is carried in the\naddress itself, permitting both IPv4-&gt;IPv6 and IPv6-&gt;IPv4
    session\nestablishment with neither state nor configuration in the IP/ICMP\ntranslator.
    \ In the stateful mode, translation state is maintained\nbetween IPv4 address/transport_port
    tuples and IPv6 address/\ntransport_port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open
    sessions with\nIPv4 systems.  The choice of operational mode is made by the operator\ndeploying
    the network and is critical to the operation of the\napplications using it.\n\nSignificant
    issues exist in the stateless and stateful modes that are\nnot addressed in this
    document, related to the address assignment and\nthe maintenance of the translation
    tables, respectively.  This\ndocument confines itself to the actual translation.\n\nAcknowledgement
    of previous work\n\nThis document is a product of the 2008-2009 effort to define
    a\nreplacement for NAT-PT.  It is an update to and directly derivative\nfrom Erik
    Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides both\nstateless and stateful translation
    between IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6\n[RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6
    [RFC4443].  The\noriginal document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.\n\nThe
    changes in this document reflect five components:\n\n1.  Redescribing the network
    model to map to present and projected\n\n usage.\n\n2.  Moving the address format
    to the framework document, to\n\n coordinate with other drafts on the topic.\n\n3.
    \ Description of both stateful and stateless operation.\n\n4.  Some changes in
    ICMP.\n\n5.  Updating references.Requirements\n\nThe keywords MUST, MUST NOT,
    REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,\nSHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL,
    when they appear in this\ndocument, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t
