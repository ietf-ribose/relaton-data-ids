abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We describe the 'out-of-band' exchange of data in a classical\n
    \  enrollment protocol as a Trusted Transitive Introduction (TTI)\n   between
    two end entities and an introducer, thus distinguishing\n   introduction from
    enrollment. This document describes the three\n   system entities in the trusted
    transitive introduction model and the\n   data exchanges between them. Three introduction
    stages are defined\n   and examined in the context of a 'TTI over HTTP' introduction.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
