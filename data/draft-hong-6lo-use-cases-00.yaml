abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the characteristics of link layer technologies
    that are used at constrained node networks and typical use cases of IPv6 over
    networks of resource-constrained nodes. In addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various
    link layer technologies such as BLE, Z-wave, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and IEEE 802.15.4e
    are widely used at constrained node networks for typical services. Based on these
    link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained nodes has
    various and practical use cases. To efficiently implement typical services, the
    applicability and consideration of several design spaces are described.</p>"
