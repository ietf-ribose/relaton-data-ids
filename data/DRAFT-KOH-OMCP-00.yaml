abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP)\nused
    for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known as\nApplication Layer
    Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data delivery\nscheme for multicast applications,
    in which one or more intermediate\nrelay agents are employed for relaying application
    data from a sender\nto many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically
    configured\ntree hierarchy. In OMCP, a special- purpose entity, called Session\nManager,
    is used to manage and control the  tree configuration and\nsession monitoring.
    OMCP is designed to ensure that the multicast\napplications and services can be
    provided over current Internet\nenvironments in which IP multicast has not completely
    been deployed.\n\t </p>\n      "
