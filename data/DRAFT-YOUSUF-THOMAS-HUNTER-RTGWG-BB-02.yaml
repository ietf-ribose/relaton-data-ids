abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Chrysolite is a combination of differing technologies to create
    a \n   wide area switched Ethernet solution. Each Chrysolite switch has a \n   unique
    MAC address (N-MAC). A link state protocol provides pairwise \n   shortest paths
    between the N-MACs (one N-MAC per switch).  \n\n   Customers connect to the Chrysolite
    cloud using Ethernet connections. \n   By setting the locally administered bit
    in the Ethernet address used \n   to connect to the Chrysolite cloud, customers
    can directly \n   encapsulate traffic into assigned source and destination C-MAC
    (MAC) \n   addresses. \n\n   Each of these C-MAC addresses specifies a unique
    customer 'VLAN \n   circuit'. This proves end to end paths across the Chrysolite
    cloud \n   without requiring any special headers, MAC in MAC or Q-in-Q \n   encapsulation.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
