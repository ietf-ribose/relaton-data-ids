abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods to avoid interactions between the flow
    control of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Quick-Start TCP mechanism.
    Quick-Start is an optional TCP congestion control extension that allows hosts
    to determine an allowed sending rate from feedback of routers along the path.
    With Quick-Start, data transfers can start with a potentially large congestion
    window and avoid the time-consuming slow-start. In order to fully utilize the
    data rate determined by Quick-Start, the sending host must not be limited by the
    TCP flow control, i. e., the amount of free buffer space advertised by the receive
    window. There are two potential interactions between Quick-Start and the TCP flow
    control: First, receivers might not provide sufficiently large buffer space after
    connection setup, or they may implement buffer allocation strategies that implicitly
    assume the slow-start behavior on the sender side. This document therefore provides
    guidelines for buffer allocation in hosts supporting the Quick-Start extension.
    Second, the TCP receive window scaling mechanism interferes with Quick-Start when
    being used in the initial three-way handshake connection setup. This document
    describes a simple solution to overcome this problem.</p>"
