abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some clients will want to know if there are one or more DoH
    servers\n   associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the client is already\n
    \  using.  This document describes a protocol for a resolver to tell a\n   client
    what its associated DoH servers are.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
