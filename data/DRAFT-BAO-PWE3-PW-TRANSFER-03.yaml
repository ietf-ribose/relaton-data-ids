abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As defined in [RFC5654] MPLS-TP transport path includes LSP
    and PW.\n   And the possibility of transferring the ownership and control of an\n
    \  existing and in-use path between the management plane and the control\n   plane,
    without actually affecting data plane traffic being carried\n   over it, is a
    valuable option for carrier.  [RFC5493] and [RFC5852]\n   describe the LSP transfer.
    \ This memo gives the requirement and LDP\n   extensions for PW transfer in an
    MPLS-TP network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
