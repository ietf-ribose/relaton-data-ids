  content: "<p>Currently, more and more hosts have multiple interfaces such as GPRS,WiFi
    etc. One key issue is how to make the applications on the hostaccess the network
    accordingly through the proper interfaces. Theapproach presented in this document

    way, the hosts canselect a appropriate route.</p>"
