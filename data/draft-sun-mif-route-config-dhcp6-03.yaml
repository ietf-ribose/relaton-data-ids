abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, more and more hosts have multiple interfaces such as GPRS,
    WiFi etc. One key issue is how to make the applications on the host access the
    network accordingly through the proper interfaces. The approach presented in this
    document is to define new DHCPv6 option to configure route tables of the hosts.
    In this way, the hosts can select a appropriate route.</p>"
