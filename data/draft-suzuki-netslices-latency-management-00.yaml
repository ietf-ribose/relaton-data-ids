abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a use case that addresses the need for latency
    management for end-to-end data transmissions through multiple domains. Specifically,
    examples of latency management schemes are described. In addition, the necessity
    of a common latency management framework and of interfaces to gather latency information
    between edges in each domain and to determine data transmission paths is addressed.</p>"
