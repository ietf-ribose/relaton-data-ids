abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In certain environments, e.g. large scale virtualization deployments,\n
    \  new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such devices\n   typically
    have their link-layer (MAC) addresses randomized.  With\n   sufficient scale,
    the likelihood of collision is not acceptable.\n   Therefore an allocation mechanism
    is required.  This draft proposes\n   an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable
    approach to link-layer\n   address assignments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
