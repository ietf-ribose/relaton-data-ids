abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in [RFC3748].This
    document defines a mechanism that allows an access network toprovide IP connectivity
    modes hints to an EAP peer -- the end of thelink that responds to the authenticator.
    The purpose is to allow theEAP peer in executing in a reliable and efficient manner
    the IPconnectivity step as soon as the authentication phase completes.This is
    useful in situations where a peer and the networks it visitssupport various IP
    connectivity modes. Without the hint, such a peermight fail or take some time
    to select a valid IP connectivity modeon the visited network. With the help of
    the hint, a visited networkprovides the peer with a list of supported IP connectivity
    modes andallows it to execute successfully the convenient IP connectivity assoon
    as the authentication is complete. The hint is particularlyuseful when users are
    performing vertical handovers through differentnetwork technologies such as wireless
    ones.</p>"
