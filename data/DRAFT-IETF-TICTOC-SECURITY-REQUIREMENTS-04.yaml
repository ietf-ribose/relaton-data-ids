abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly
    common\n   and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security\n
    \  threats is increasing. This document defines a set of security\n   requirements
    for time synchronization protocols, focusing on the\n   Precision Time Protocol
    (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\n   This document also discusses the
    security impacts of time\n   synchronization protocol practices, the time synchronization\n
    \  performance implications of external security practices, the\n   dependencies
    between other security services and time\n   synchronization.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
