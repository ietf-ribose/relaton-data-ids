abstract:
- content: "<p>To construct meaningful audits of terminations while controlling the
    amount of data sent in response to the audits, it would be very helpful if the
    MGC understood the way terminations were named in the MG. This package provides
    a method for obtaining the naming pattern for terminations in an MG</p>"
