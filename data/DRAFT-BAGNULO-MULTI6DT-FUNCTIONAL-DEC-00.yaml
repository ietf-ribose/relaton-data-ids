abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this note we will present a functional decomposition of
    the M6\n   protocol i.e.  the protocol for preserving established communications\n
    \  in multihomed environments.  We will do so by describing a protocol\n   walkthrough,
    presenting which functions have to be performed at each\n   stage and the messages
    required to accomplish them.  The functional\n   decomposition presented in this
    draft is based on the general\n   functional analysis of multihoming approaches
    presented in [3].\n\t </p>\n      "
