  content: "\n\t <p>  In accordance with rapid increase of data related to IoT and
    big\n  data, techniques to control high capacity data is currently active\n  and
    vibrant research field. Enterprises are trying to manage data on\n  the cloud
    because of flexibility and capability. However, there are\n  some limits to handle
    data intelligently in cloud. The SDS is\n  considered as a good technique regarding
    this manner. SDS improves\n  efficiency, scalability and flexibility in scale-out
    architecture,\n  as well as, provides a cost effective solution using the existing\n
    \ storage resources efficiently.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
