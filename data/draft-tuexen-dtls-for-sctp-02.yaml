abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport LayerSecurity
    (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control TransmissionProtocol (SCTP).The user of
    DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all featuresprovided by SCTP and its extensions,
    especially support ofo multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.o multi-homing
    to provide network level fault tolerance.o unordered delivery.o partial reliable
    data transfer.</p>"
