abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For wide scale routing protocols to build their topology and\n
    \  reachability databases they need to discover the encapsulation data\n   on
    a link, link IP layer 3 attributes, attributes for IP layer 3 and\n   above protocols
    on that link, and link liveness.  We refer to this as\n   neighbor discovery.
    \ BGP-LS and its enhancements provide an API to\n   present much of these data
    to BGP protocols, but do not directly\n   collect these data.  This document explores
    the needs and criteria\n   for the data needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
