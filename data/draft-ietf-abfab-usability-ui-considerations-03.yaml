abstract:
- content: "<p>The real world use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that any identity
    that is to be used for authentication has to be configured on the ABFAB-enabled
    client device. Achieving this requires software on that device (either built into
    the operating system or a standalone utility) that will interact with the user,
    managing their identity information and identity-to-service mappings. All designers
    of software to fulfil this role will face the same set of challenges. This document
    aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs
    with some degree of consistency between implementations.</p>"
