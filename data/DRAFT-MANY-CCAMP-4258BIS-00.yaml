abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of
    \n   protocols has been defined to control different switching \n   technologies
    as well as different applications.  These include \n   support for requesting
    Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections \n   including Synchronous Optical
    Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital \n   Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport
    Networks (OTNs).  This document concentrates on the routing requirements placed
    on the \n   GMPLS suite of protocols in order to support the capabilities and
    \n   functionalities of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) \n   as
    defined by the ITU-T. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
