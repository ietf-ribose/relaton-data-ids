abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides applicability, use case studies and
    network\n   design considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport\n
    \  profile (MPLS-TP).\n\n   In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology
    of choice\n   for the new generation of packet transport. Many service providers\n
    \  (SPs) are working to replace the legacy transport technologies, e.g.\n   SONET/SDH,
    TDM, and ATM technologies, with MPLS-TP for packet\n   transport, in order to
    achieve higher efficiency, lower operational\n   cost, while maintaining transport
    characteristics.\n\n   The use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro Ethernet access
    and\n   aggregation, Mobile backhaul, and packet optical transport. The\n   design
    considerations discussed in this documents ranging from\n   operational experience;
    standards compliance; technology maturity;\n   end-to-end forwarding and OAM consistency;
    compatibility with\n   IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor interoperability; and optimization\n
    \  vs. simplicity design trade off discussion. The general design\n   principle
    is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport\n   solutions.\n\n\n\n\t
