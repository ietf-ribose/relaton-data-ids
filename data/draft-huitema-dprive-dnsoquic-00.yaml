abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy
    for DNS. The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to that provided
    by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of- line blocking issues inherent
    with TCP and provides more efficient error corrections than UDP. DNS over QUIC
    (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC7858,
    and performance characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.</p>"
