abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a solution for BGP route reflectors
    to allow\n   them to choose the best path for their clients that the clients\n
    \  themselves would have chosen under the same conditions, without\n   requiring
    further state or any new features to be placed on the\n   clients.  This facilitates,
    for example, best exit point policy (hot\n   potato routing).  This solution is
    primarily applicable in\n   deployments using centralized route reflectors.\n\n
    \  The solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths\n   which
    are eligible for consideration.  Best path selection is\n   performed in each
    route reflector based on a configured virtual\n   location in the IGP.  The location
    can be the same for all clients or\n   different per peer/update group or per
    peer.  Best path selection can\n   also be performed based on user configured
    policies in each route\n   reflector.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
