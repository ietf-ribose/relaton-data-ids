abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet capable mobile or portable devices are already a modern
    \ncommodity while it is becoming all the more common that such devices are \nhosts
    to more then one wireless interface. The aim of this document is \nto show that
    a mobile user may make best use of this property by using \nmultiple wireless
    interfaces in parallel. This would incline that the \nmobile user can distribute
    active flows across the available wireless \ninterfaces and is able to seamlessly
    transfer them between the wireless \ninterfaces in mid-session without interruption.
