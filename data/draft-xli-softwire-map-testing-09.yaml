abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the testing results of a unified code accommodating
    encapsulation and translation modes of Mapping of Address and Port (MAP). Experiments
    show that the unified MAP CE is not only supporting MAP-E and MAP-T modes, but
    also backward compatible with AFTR of dual-stack lite and stateless/stateful NAT64.</p>"
