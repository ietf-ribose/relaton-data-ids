abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd) defined in RFC5880
    is\n   comprehensive and has sufficient mechanisms to overcome challenges in\n
    \  surviving Graceful Restart (Planned). However, implementations with\n   architectural
    limitation were found to influence a BFD failure, in a\n   process intensive environment.This
    memo outlines design options to\n   overcome the challenges, within the existing
    bfd framework, in\n   surviving planned GracefulRestart.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
