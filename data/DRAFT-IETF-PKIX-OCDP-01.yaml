abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the
    X.509\nCRL mechanism used to determine if a public-key certificate is valid or\nrevoked.
    \ These enhancements provide advantages over existing CRL\nmechanisms, including
    those that use static CRL partitioning as defined\nin ISO/IEC 9504-8/ITU-T Rec.
    X.509.  In particular, the mechanisms\nproposed can:\n \n(a) reduce the need for
    unnecessarily fetching unchanged CRLs, thereby\ngreatly expanding the value of
    caching CRLs;\n(b) allow CRL timeliness to be improved;\n(c) accommodate dynamic
    partitioning as opposed to fixed partitioning;\n(d) better support use of certificates
    in multiple environments with\ndifferent CRL stores.\n \nThis document is submitted
    for consideration as the basis of possible\nfuture IETF standardization.  Please
    send comments on this document to\nthe ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.\n\t </p>\n
