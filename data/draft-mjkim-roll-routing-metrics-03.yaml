abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document specifies routing metrics to be used in pathcalculation
    for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL).Low power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) have unique characteristicscompared with traditional wired networks or
    even with similar onessuch as mobile ad-hoc networks. By contrast with typical
    InteriorGateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or linkattributes,
    this document specifies a set of routing metrics suitableto LLNs.</p>"
