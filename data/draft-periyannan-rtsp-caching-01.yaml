abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the issues facing streaming media caching. It
    proposes a set of mechanisms to enable streaming media caching between standards-based
    RTSP/RTP servers and proxies. Streaming media caching refers to the process through
    which streaming content is dynamically replicated closer to users so as to provide
    a better viewing experience. A list of RTSP enhancements and open issues are presented.
    This document is intended to be a starting point for discussion between various
    parties interested in standardizing the mechanism used by RTSP/RTP servers to
    enable streaming media caching.</p>"
