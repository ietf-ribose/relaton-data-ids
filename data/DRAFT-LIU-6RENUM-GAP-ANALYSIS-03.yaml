abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms could
    be\n   utilized by IPv6 site renumbering and envisions the effort could be\n   done.
    This document tries to cover the most explicit issues and\n   requirements of
    IPv6 renumbering. Through the gap analysis, the\n   document provides a basis
    for future work to identify and develop\n   solutions or to stimulate such development
    as appropriate. The gap\n   analysis is presented following a renumbering event
    procedure clue.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
