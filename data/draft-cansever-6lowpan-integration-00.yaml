abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group was formed in 2004 to address the challenge
    of enabling wireless IPv6 communication over the newly standardized IEEE 802.15.4
    low-power radio for devices with limited space, power and memory, such as sensor
    nodes [3]. IEEE 802.15.4 radio links, coupled with the interoperability and ubiquity
    of IP, will lead to exciting new deployment scenarios for these low-power networks.
    Sensor wireless networks will be integrated into wired and/or wireless fixed infrastructure.
    The integration of these sensor networks with the Internet and wireless infrastructure
    networks increases the network capacity, coverage area and application domains.
    In this draft we provide various integration scenarios and discuss associated
    issues with such deployments.</p>"
