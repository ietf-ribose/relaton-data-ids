abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores
    to track\n'SEQUENCE' and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access
    to\ncalendar stores.\n\nWith iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored
    CS data. With\nWebDAV, HTTP, or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data
    of\nother calendars. The storage of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not
    been standardized yet. This memo proposes a way to standardize on\nthose persistent
    items.\n\nAlso included are ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL]
    and\n[iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID' property work between vendors and to document the\nprocedures
    to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's.\n\t </p>\n      "
