abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a security-aware
    validating resolver configured to use a Forwarder to send a single query, requesting
    a complete validation path along with the regular query answer. The reduction
    in queries potentially lowers the latency and reduces the need to send multiple
    queries at once. This extension mandates the use of source IP verified transport
    such as TCP or UDP with EDNS-COOKIE so it cannot be abused in amplification attacks.</p>"
