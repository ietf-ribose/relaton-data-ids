abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The layer 3 mobility management in a mobile wireless network
    can be\n   performed with Mobile IPv4.  The solution however requires the mobile\n
    \  nodes to have Mobile IPv4 clients.  There may be scenarios where the\n   mobile
    devices do not have Mobile IPv4 clients.  The layer 3 mobility\n   for these devices
    (often called simple IPv4 mobiles) can be done if\n   the network has a Mobile
    IPv4 client function that can perform Mobile\n   IPv4 procedures on behalf of
    the mobile nodes.  This document defines\n   such a mechanism.\n\t </p>\n      "
