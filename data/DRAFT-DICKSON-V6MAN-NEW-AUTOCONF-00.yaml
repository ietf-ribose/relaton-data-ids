abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet Draft discusses a proposed extension to the set
    of\nInterface Identifier construction methods for 802 networks.  The\npurpose
    of this is to allow autoconf RA announcments of prefix length\nother than 64 bits.
    \ It is intended to be fully backward compatible\nfor /64 announcements.  Instead
    of having one Interface Identifier\nconstruction method for all purposes, this
    adds an alternate method\nwhich is only used for autoconf, and only if the prefix
    length is not\n/64.  No other IPv6 methods or protocols require modification.\nHowever,
    without modification, use of prefixes other than /64 likely\nwon't support many
    IPv6 enhanced functions.\n\nThe ultimate goal it providing enough bits between
    the top level\nallocation by Regional Internet Registristry (RIR) and the smallest\nautoconfiguration
    allocation, to allow both external aggregation by\nISPs into one prefix, as well
    as internal hierarchical aggregation to\nsupport a variety of ISP topologies and
    practices.  Current policies\nare driven from below by the current 64 bit Interface
    Identifier.\nOnly by relaxing this to 48 bits for such technologies as 802\n(Ethernet),
    does the number of bits available reach a level deemed\n\"sufficient\".Author's
    Note\n\nThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s)
    being placed on the Standards Track for 6man.\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [5].\n\t </p>\n      "
