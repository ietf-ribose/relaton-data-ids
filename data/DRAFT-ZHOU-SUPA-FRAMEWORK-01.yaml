abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Currently, there are network services that impose specific
    demands\n   on a communication network. This document describes the SUPA basic\n
    \  architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main SUPA\n   architecture
    entities are the Service Management (SM) and the\n   Network Manager/Controller
    (NM/NC). The SM is a functional entity\n   that creates and runs network services
    by using a set of NM/NCs. The\n   NM/NC is a functional entity that provides one
    or more of the\n   following functions: (1) the generation, maintenance and release
    of\n   network topologies, (2) the generation, maintenance, and release of\n   network
    service-specific abstractions, (3) the mapping between\n   network service-specific
    abstractions and the network topology, and\n   (4) the mapping between network
    service-specific abstractions and\n   network device configuration. Both the SM
    and the NM/NC may be made\n   up of multiple distinct entities that collectively
    perform their\n   functions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
