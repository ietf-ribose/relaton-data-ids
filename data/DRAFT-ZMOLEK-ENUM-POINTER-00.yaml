abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Current notions of service field tags in ENUM NAPTR records would
    \nframe the service exposure problem as a tradeoff between the privacy \nand heft
    involved in revealing detailed service information on the \none hand or the arbitrary
    constraint of such information on the \nother. This draft suggests an alternative
    approach that keeps NAPTR \nrecord size small, places service exposure policy
    and presence \ncapabilities in the hands of the ENUM registrant where it belongs,
    \nand minimizes impact to the ENUM registrar and their respective DNS \narchitecture.
    \n\n\t </p>\n      "
