abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address\n
    \  Translation (NAT), the primary benefit of \"amplifying\" available\n   address
    space is not needed in IPv6.  In addition to its many serious\n   disadvantages
    there is a perception that other benefits exist, such\n   as a variety of management
    and security reasons that could be useful\n   for an Internet Protocol.  IPv6
    does not support NAT by design and\n   this document shows how Network Architecture
    Protection (NAP) using\n   IPv6 can provide the benefits without the need for
    NAT.\n\t </p>\n      "
