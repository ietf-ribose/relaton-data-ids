abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the concept of URI Signing supports the
    content access control requirements of Content Delivery Network Interconnection
    (CDNI) and proposes a URI Signing method as a JSON Web Token (JWT) profile. The
    proposed URI Signing method specifies the information needed to be included in
    the URI to transmit the signed JWT, as well as the claims needed by the signed
    JWT to authorize a User Agent (UA). The mechanism described can be used both in
    CDNI and single Content Delivery Network (CDN) scenarios.</p>"
