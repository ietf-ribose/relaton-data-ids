abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) based\nmechanism
    for transmission of user data packets, to be used with the\nHost Identity Protocol
    (HIP).\n\nIESG Note\n\nThe following issues describe IESG concerns about this
    document.  The\nIESG expects that these issues will be addressed when future versions\nof
    HIP are designed.\n\nIn case of complex Security Policy Databases (SPDs) and the
    co-\nexistence of HIP and security-related protocols such as IKE,\nimplementors
    may encounter conditions that are unspecified in these\ndocuments.  For example,
    when the SPD defines an IP address subnet to\nbe protected and a HIP host is residing
    in that IP address area,\nthere is a possibility that the communication is encrypted
    multiple\ntimes.  Readers are advised to pay special attention when running HIP\nwith
    complex SPD settings.  Future specifications should clearly\ndefine when multiple
    encryption is intended, and when it should be\navoided.\n\t </p>\n      "
