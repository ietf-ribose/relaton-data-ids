abstract:
- content: "<p>Some mail systems have been observed to use authentication schemes
    the domain name in the From: header as a security key, in combination with DKIM,
    an approach works poorly in connection with forwarders that edit messages. This
    document describes a profile of DKIM intended to improve interoperation of DKIM
    with such schemes.</p>"
