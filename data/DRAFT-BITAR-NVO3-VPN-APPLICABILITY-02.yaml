abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        Multi-tenant data centers and clouds provide computing,\n
    \       storage and network resources dedicated per tenant. The\n        current
    focus in the evolution of multi-tenant data-center and\n        cloud networks
    is to (1) support a large number of tenants\n        with a large number of communicating
    systems, (2) provide\n        isolation among tenant virtual networks, (3) provide
    for\n        efficient network utilization, and (4) support virtual machine\n
    \       mobility and network elasticity that match compute and storage\n        elasticity.\n\n\n
    \       The NVo3 work effort is initially targeted to identify the\n        requirements
    for large multi-tenant data centers, and develop\n        a framework architecture
    that addresses those requirements. In\n        addition, it is targeted to identify
    existing or evolving\n        solutions used in cloud networking, their applicability
    to\n        NVo3, and any gaps that they may have in addressing the NVo3\n        requirements.
    This document describes the applicability of\n        existing work in various
    IETF Working Groups (e.g., RFCs and\n        drafts developed or evolving in IETF
    L2VPN and L3VPN Working\n        Groups) to cloud networking and NVo3, as well
    as the gaps and\n        problems that need to be further addressed.\n\n\t </p>\n
