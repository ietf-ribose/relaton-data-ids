abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo proposes an extensible Real-Time Protocol (RTP) monitoring\n
    \  framework for extending RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) with a new RTCP\n   Extended
    Reports (XR) block type to report new metrics regarding\n   media transmission
    or reception quality.  In this framework, a new XR\n   block should contain a
    single metric or a small number of metrics\n   relevant to a single parameter
    of interest or concern, rather than\n   containing a number of metrics which attempt
    to provide full coverage\n   of all those parameters of concern to a specific
    application.\n   Applications may then \"mix and match\" to create a set of blocks
    which\n   covers their set of concerns.  Where possible, a specific block\n   should
    be designed to be re-usable across more than one application,\n   for example,
    for all of voice, streaming audio and video.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
