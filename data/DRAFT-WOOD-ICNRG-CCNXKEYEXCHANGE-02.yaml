abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Version 1.0 of the CCNx Key Exchange
    (CCNxKE)\n   protocol.  The CCNxKE protocol allows two peers to establish a\n
    \  shared, forward-secure key for secure and confidential communication.\n   The
    protocol is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and\n   message forgery
    between two peers.  It is also designed to minimize\n   the number of rounds required
    to establish a shared key.  In the\n   worst case, it requires two RTTs between
    a consumer and producer to\n   establish a shared key.  In the best case, one
    RTT is required before\n   sending any application data.  This document outlines
    how to derive\n   the keys used to encrypt traffic for a session and shows how
    session\n   information is exchanged between a consumer and producer using\n   message
    encapsulation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
