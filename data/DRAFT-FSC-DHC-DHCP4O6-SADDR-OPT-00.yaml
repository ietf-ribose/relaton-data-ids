abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes
    one\n   possible mechanism for dynamically configuring IPv4 over an IPv6 only\n
    \  network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with some softwire\n   mechanisms,
    the operator must obtain information about the DHCP 4o6\n   client's allocated
    IPv4 address and PSID, as well as the /128 IPv6\n   prefix that the client will
    use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.\n   This memo defines a DHCPv6 option
    to convey this IPv6 prefix between\n   the DHCP 4o6 client and server.  It is
    designed to work in\n   conjunction with the DHCPv4 IPv4 address allocation process
    message\n   flow.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
