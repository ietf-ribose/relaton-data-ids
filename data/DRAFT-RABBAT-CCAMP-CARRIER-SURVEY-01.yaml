abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Optical transport networks operated using a GMPLS-based control
    plane \n   enable todays network operators to offer valuable new services. With
    \n   the completion of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards \n   and
    the availability of products implementing them, providers are now \n   looking
    at ways to enable additional features, such as shared-mesh \n   restoration. These
    can be key to efficient network operation while \n   providing strict performance
    guarantees. In that context, several \n   areas of work still need to be addressed
    within the CCAMP WG of the \n   IETF to develop interoperable, standards-based
    solutions that \n   carriers can embrace. \n    \n   Towards that end, this document
    presents the results of a serious \n   attempt to systematically gather and collate
    carrier inputs on \n   strategies for shared-mesh restoration and the associated
    issues. The \n   survey results are presented in aggregate form to provide an
    overview\n   of carrier thinking, while retaining specific carrier response \n
    \  confidentiality. The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, \n   and
    identify specific work items to focus on and facilitate further \n   discussion
    on them. This is to enable the CCAMP WG to pursue ongoing \n   and further work
    in this area that is focused towards addressing the \n   identified carrier requirements.
