abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n
    \  established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF\n   evolved
    in ways that required changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The purpose
    of this document is to document and describe\n   the IASA 2.0 structure.\n\n   Under
    IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising\n   tasks is conducted
    by an administrative organization, the IETF\n   Administration Limited Liability
    Company (\"IETF LLC\").  Under this\n   structure, the Internet Administrative
    Oversight Committee (IAOC) was\n   eliminated, and its oversight and advising
    functions transferred to\n   the IETF LLC Board.\n\n   This document describes
    the structure of the IETF Administrative\n   Support Activity, version 2 (IASA
    2.0).  It defines the roles and\n   responsibilities of the IETF LLC Board, the
    IETF Executive Director,\n   and ISOC in the fiscal and administrative support
    of the IETF\n   standards process.  It also defines the membership and selection\n
    \  rules for the IETF LLC Board.\n\n   This document obsoletes [RFC4071] (BCP101),
    [RFC4333], and [RFC7691].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
