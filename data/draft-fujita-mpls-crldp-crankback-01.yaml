abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDPsignaling.
    Recently, several routing protocol extensions foradvertising resource information
    in addition to topology informationhave been proposed for use in distributed constraint-based
    routing.In such a distributed routing environment, however, the informationused
    to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. Thismeans that label requests
    may be blocked by links or nodes withoutsufficient resources. This draft specifies
    crankback routingextensions for CR-LDP so that the label request can be retried
    on analternate path that detours around the blocked link or node upon asetup failure.
    Furthermore, the proposed crankback routing schemescan be also applied to end-to-end
    LSP restoration by indicating thelocation of the failure link or node. This would
    significantlyimprove the recovery ratio for failed LSPs, especially in situationswhere
    a large number of setup requests are triggered at the sametime.</p>"
