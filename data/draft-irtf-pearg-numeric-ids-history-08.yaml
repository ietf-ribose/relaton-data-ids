abstract:
- content: <p>This document analyzes the timeline of the specification and implementation
    of different types of "transient numeric identifiers" used in IETF protocols,
    and how the security and privacy properties of such protocols have been affected
    as a result of it. It provides empirical evidence that advice in this area is
    warranted. This document is a product of the Privacy Enhancement and Assessment
    Research Group (PEARG) in the IRTF.</p>
