abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP communities [RFC 1997] are 64-bit values that are used to
    tag\nthe originated or traversing prefixes for the different purposes, such as
    origination tagging or policy application purposes. These values can\nbe displayed
    in a new and old format, which notes different\nrepresentation of the same 64-bit
    value. This document defines the way\nof tagging prefixes based upon their geographical
    origination to assist\nin development of geographically-based policies that, ideally,
    will\nresult in RTD (Round Trip Delay) value improvements, as optimized paths\ncan
    be established.\n\t </p>\n      "
