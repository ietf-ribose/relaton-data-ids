abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Location-based services (such as navigation applications, emergency\nservices,
    management of equipment in the field) need geographic\nlocation information about
    Internet hosts, their users, and other\nrelated entities.  These applications
    need to securely gather and\ntransfer location information for location services,
    and at the same\ntime protect the privacy of the individuals involved.  This document\ndescribes
    an architecture for privacy-preserving location-based\nservices in the Internet,
    focusing on authorization, security, and\nprivacy requirements for the data formats
    and protocols used by these\nservices.\n\t </p>\n      "
