abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases
    of IP-\n   based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems\n
    \  (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-\n   to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-\n   everything (V2X) communications.
    \ First, this document explains use\n   cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    \ Next, it makes a problem\n   statement about key aspects in IP-based vehicular
    networking, such as\n   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security
    &amp; Privacy.\n   For each key aspect, this document specifies requirements in
    IP-based\n   vehicular networking, and suggests the direction of solutions\n   satisfying
    those requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
