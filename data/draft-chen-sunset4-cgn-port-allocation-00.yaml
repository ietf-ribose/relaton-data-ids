abstract:
- content: "<p>The document enumerated methods of port assignment in CGN contexts.
    The analysis categorized the different methods with several key features. Corresponding
    to those features, the uses of existing protocols are also described. The potential
    concerns and workaround have been discussed. It's expected the document could
    provide a informative base line to help operators choosing a proper method.</p>"
