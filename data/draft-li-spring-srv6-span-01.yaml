abstract:
- content: "<p>As an important means for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), mirroring
    is the most direct and comprehensive technology for capturing data streams and
    forwarding information. Compared with other visualization technologies, it can
    not only obtain the content of an entire packet, but also add forwarding information
    of a network device to a mirror packet and send the packet to a remote analysis
    server.</p>"
