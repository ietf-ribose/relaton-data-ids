abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In [RFC5309] defines the P2P circuit type is one of the mainly
    used\n   circuit types in link state routing protocol, and highlights it is\n
    \  important to identify the correct circuit type when forming\n   adjacencies,
    flooding link state database packets, and monitor the\n   link state.\n\n   P2P
    Interface over LAN ifType value is assigned by IANA experts\n   review.  This
    document provides an example of the ifStack for P2P\n   Interface over LAN ifType
    to facilitate operational control,\n   maintenance and statistics.\n\n\t </p>\n
