abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP has a number of security mechanisms for hop-by-hop and end-to-end
    protection. Some of the security mechanisms have been built in to the SIP protocol,
    such as HTTP authentication or secure attachments. In these mechanisms there are
    even alternative algorithms and parameters.</p>"
