abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred
    in the\n   space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has\n   focused
    on two use-cases: network and web-based access.  However, the\n   solutions to
    these use-cases that have been proposed and deployed\n   tend to have few common
    building blocks in common.\n\n   This memo describes an architecture that makes
    use of extensions to\n   the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated
    and non-\n   federated access management, including RADIUS, Diameter, GSS, GS2,\n
    \  EAP and SAML.  The architecture addresses the problem of federated\n   access
    management to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner\n   that will scale
    to large numbers of identity providers, relying\n   parties, and federations.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
