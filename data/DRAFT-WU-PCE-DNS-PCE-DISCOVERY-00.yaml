abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Discovery of the (Path Computation Element (PCE) within an
    IGP area\n   or domain is possible using OSPF [RFC5088] and IS-IS [RFC5089].\n
    \  However, in some deployment scenarios PCEs may not wish, or be able,\n   to
    participate within the IGP process.  Therefore it would be\n   beneficial for
    the Path Computation Client (PCC) to discover PCEs via\n   an alternative mechanism
    to those proposed in [RFC5088] and\n   [RFC5089].\n\n   This document specifies
    the requirements, use cases, procedures and\n   extensions to support DNS for
    PCE discovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
