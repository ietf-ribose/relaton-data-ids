abstract:
- content: "<p>FEC coding is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separate
    from the loss detection of congestion controls. Using FEC coding can be a useful
    way to deal with transfer tail losses or with networks having non-congestion losses.
    However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals. This memo offers
    a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist. Another objective
    is to encourage the research community to also consider congestion control aspects
    when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems. This
    document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research
    Group (NWCRG). The scope of the document is end-to-end communications: FEC coding
    for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document.</p>"
