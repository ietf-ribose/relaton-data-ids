- content: "<p>The MIF working group is producing a solution to solve the issues that
    are associated with nodes that can be attached to multiple networks. One part
    of the solution requires associating configuration information with provisioning
    domains. This document details how configuration information provided through
    DHCPv6 can be associated with provisioning domains.</p>"
