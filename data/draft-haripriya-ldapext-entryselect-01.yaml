abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines an LDAPv3 control that can select multipleentries
    in a subtree of a container entry for modification ordeletion. This control extends
    the scope of the LDAPv3 modify anddelete operations as defined in [RFC 2251].
    This control is usefulfor modifying or deleting multiple entries on the basis
    of asingle selection criterion. This may be useful for maintenance ofan LDAP directory
    having a large number of objects.Example of Usage - This control can be used by
    client applicationswho have the need to modify or delete a large number of entries
    inan LDAP directory based on a selection criterion. One example ofsuch a usage
    is when two departments in an organization merge. Inthis case the 'department'
    name or number given to a number ofemployees need to change, and all the employees
    in a givendepartment are to be assigned the new 'department'. Here theEntrySelection
    control can be used to select the entries to bemodified based on the 'department'
    value, and the modify operationcan change the 'department' value for all the selected
    entries tothe given value.</p>"
