abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications
    to\n   directly collect and export telemetry data about any user packet at\n   each
    node on the forwarding path.  PBT has two variations.  One\n   requires inserting
    an instruction header to user packets to guide the\n   data collection.  This
    variation has been recast into an independent\n   IOAM option mode, Direct Export,
    and described in a standalone\n   document.  This document describes the second
    variation, the mark\n   triggered PBT or PBT-M.  PBT-M only marks the user packets
    or\n   configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection and postcard\n
    \  export.  It complements IOAM by addressing several specific\n   implementation
    and deployment challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
