abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This document specifies an extension to the Kerberos protocol
    for\n    performing initial authentication of a user without using that\n    user's
    long-lived password.  Any \"hardware preauthentication\" method\n    may be employed
    instead of the password, and the key of another\n    principal must be nominated
    to encrypt the returned credential.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
