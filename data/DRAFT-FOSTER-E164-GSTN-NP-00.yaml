abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number\nportability
    (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).\nThere are three types of
    number portability: service provider number\nportability (SPNP), location portability,
    and service portability.\nService provider portability, the focus of the present
    draft, is a\nregulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize local\ntelephony
    service competition, by enabling end-users to retain pre-\nexisting telephone
    numbers while changing service providers.\nImplementation of NP within national
    GSTN entails potentially\nsignificant changes to numbering administration, network
    element\nsignaling, call routing and processing, billing, service management,\nand
    other functions.  NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialed\nE.164 number
    from a hierarchical physical routing address to a\nvirtual address, thereby requiring
    the transparent translation of\nthe later to the former.  In addition, there are
    various regulatory\nconstraints which establish relevant parameters for NP\nimplementation,
    most of which are not network technology specific.\nConsequently, the implementation
    of NP behavior consistent with\napplicable regulatory constraints, as well as
    the need for\ninteroperation with the existing GSTN NP implementations, are\nrelevant
    topics for numerous areas of IP telephony work-in-progress\nat IETF.\n\t </p>\n
