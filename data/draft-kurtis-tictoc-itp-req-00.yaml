abstract:
- content: "<p>Providing timing services over an IP network, known as wall-clock,
    has traditionally been done with the Network Time Protocol, NTP. The current version
    of NTP, version 4, has been in existence for a long time, but only recently been
    adopted as an IETF Standard. In the mean time however, the requirements for higher
    precision of wall- clock services over IP networks has grown. This document outlines
    some of the requirements of wall-clock services that is not provided by NTPv4,
    and is intended to serve as a gap analysis.</p>"
