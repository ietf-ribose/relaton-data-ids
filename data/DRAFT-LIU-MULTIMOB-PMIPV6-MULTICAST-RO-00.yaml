abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has
    issued\n   several proposals including the base solution,dedicated schemes and\n
    \  direct routing which requires all communications to go through the\n   local
    mobility anchor(LMA),the dedicated server and the native\n   multicasting infrastructure
    ,respectively.  As this can be\n   suboptimal, localized routing (LR) allows multicast
    source attached\n   to the same or different mobile access gateways(MAG) with
    mobile node\n   to send multicast data by using localized forwarding or a direct\n
    \  tunnel between the gateways without any dedicated devices or\n   dependence
    of the native multicasting infrastructure.  This document\n   describes multicast
    routes optimazition mechanisms for localized\n   routing.The MAG and the LMA are
    the mobility entities defined in the\n   PMIPv6 protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.\n\n\t
