abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the management of the mobility events\nconsidered
    in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their related\nparameters.\nThe mobility
    events management will allow a SPIRITS server to\nsubscribe to and to be notified
    of location changes of a mobile\nuser. The events would only be applicable to
    mobile users reachable\nthrough a CS network. The sending of these events must
    be allowed by\nsetting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocol\nmust
    be able to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobility\ninformation into
    events that can be transferred to the SPIRITS\nclient.\n\t </p>\n      "
