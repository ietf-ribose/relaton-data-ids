abstract:
- content: "<p>For distributed computing, the P4 research community has published
    a paper to show how to split a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous
    network nodes in a network. Examples of nodes are a network switch, a smartNIC,
    or a host machine. The paper has developed artifacts to split program based on
    latency, data rate, cost, etc. However, the paper does not mention any requirements.
    To provide guidance, this document covers requirements for splitting P4 programs
    for heterogeneous network nodes.</p>"
