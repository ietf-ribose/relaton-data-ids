abstract:
  content: "<p>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and
    IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start utilizing Mobile
    IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these parameters are statically
    configured. Ongoing work aims to make this information dynamically available to
    the mobile node. An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution
    is to support interworking with existing authentication, authorization and accounting
    infrastructure. This document defines a Diameter application to facilitate Mobile
    IPv6 bootstrapping for the integrated scenario.</p>"
