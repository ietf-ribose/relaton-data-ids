abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers
    to select\n   the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user\n
    \  agent's characteristics, as expressed in request headers.  In\n   practice,
    clients are often unwilling to send those request headers,\n   because it is not
    clear whether they will be used, and sending them\n   impacts both performance
    and privacy.\n\n   This document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers
    can\n   use to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content\n
    \  negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such\n   headers,
    colloquially known as \"Client Hints.\"\n\n\t </p>\n      "
