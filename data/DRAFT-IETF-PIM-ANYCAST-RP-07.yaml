abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification allows Anycast-RP (Rendezvous Point) to be
    used inside a domain that runs Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) only.  Other
    multicast protocols (such as Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP), which
    has been used traditionally to solve this problem) are not required to support
    Anycast-RP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t </p>\n      "
