abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP
    level\nQoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wireless\nsystems
    (beyond what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodes\nmay access an IP
    backbone over diverse access networks, the IP level\nQoS primitives are not only
    used to specify the requested IP level\nservice, but also (through an access specific
    translation function)\nto help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure
    the\nwireless bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoS\nprimitives
    must meet special requirements in order to support the\nspectrum efficient management
    of the wireless resources.\n\t </p>\n      "
