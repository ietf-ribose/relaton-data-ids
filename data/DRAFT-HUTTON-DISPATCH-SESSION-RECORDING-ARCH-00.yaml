abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications\nenvironments
    such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of\nthese environments, all
    calls must be recorded for regulatory,\ncompliance, and consumer protection reasons.
    \ Recording of a session\nis typically performed by sending a copy of a media
    stream to a\nrecording device.  This document describes architectures for\ndeploying
    session recording solutions in an environment which is\nbased on the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP).  This is an initial\ndraft which explores possible architectural
    solutions and has many\nopen issues.\n\t </p>\n      "
