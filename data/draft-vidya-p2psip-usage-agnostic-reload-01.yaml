abstract:
  content: "<p>RELOAD [1] defines an overlay framework for providing peer-to-peerconnectivity
    and storage/retreival primitives for applications.Applications or usages are expected
    to reside on top of such anoverlay. In general, this is a good design that allows
    multipleapplications to use the same overlay framework. In such a design,however,
    there are some decisions to be made in terms of what is anoverlay function and
    what must be defined by a usage. Thesedecisions should generally be based on whether
    the particularfunction is expecting an operation or guarantee from the overlaynodes
    in general or from a particular usage only. This type ofseparation is especially
    crucial to avoid needing flag days forupgrading nodes in order to accommodate
    a newer usage version forperforming the overlay operation.</p>"
