abstract:
- content: "<p>RELOAD [1] defines an overlay framework for providing peer-to-peer
    connectivity and storage/retreival primitives for applications. Applications or
    usages are expected to reside on top of such an overlay. In general, this is a
    good design that allows multiple applications to use the same overlay framework.
    In such a design, however, there are some decisions to be made in terms of what
    is an overlay function and what must be defined by a usage. These decisions should
    generally be based on whether the particular function is expecting an operation
    or guarantee from the overlay nodes in general or from a particular usage only.
    This type of separation is especially crucial to avoid needing flag days for upgrading
    nodes in order to accommodate a newer usage version for performing the overlay
    operation.</p>"
