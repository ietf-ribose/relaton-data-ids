abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides
    the\nsupport of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part of\nthe
    CSIP architecture is the specification of the CSIP (Connectionless\nSCCP over
    IP) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between the\nSCCP layer already
    defined in [2] and the IP family protocols IP, UDP,\nTCP and ICMP. UDP is used
    when SCCP class 0 is used, TCP is used\nwhen SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides
    the primitives and parameters\nto SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility
    that guarantees\nthe seamless connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classical\nSS7
    nodes by means of a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented to\nfulfill the
    requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.\n\t </p>\n      "
