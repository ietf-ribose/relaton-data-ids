abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The rapid growth in the variety and importance of traffic flowing\n
    \  over increasingly complex enterprise and service provider network\n   architectures
    makes the task of network operations and management\n   applications and deploying
    new services much more difficult.\n   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA)
    defines an interface\n   to a network management function that takes high-level,
    possibly\n   network-wide policies as input and creates element configuration\n
    \  snippets as output. SUPA expresses policies using a generic policy\n   information
    model, and outputs generic YANG data models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
