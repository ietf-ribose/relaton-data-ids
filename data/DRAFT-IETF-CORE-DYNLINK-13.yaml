abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines Link Bindings, which provide dynamic\n
    \  linking of state updates between resources, either on an endpoint or\n   between
    endpoints, for systems using CoAP (RFC7252).  This\n   specification also defines
    Conditional Notification and Control\n   Attributes that work with Link Bindings
    or with CoAP Observe\n   (RFC7641).\n\nEditor note\n\n   The git repository for
    the draft is found at https://github.com/core-\n   wg/dynlink\n\n\t </p>\n      "
