abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for a host to signal via PCP which
    connections should be protected against network failures. These connections will
    be elected to be subject to high availability mechanisms enabled at the network
    side. This approach assumes that aplications/users have more visibility about
    sensitive connections rather than any heuristic that can be enabled at the network
    side to guess which connections should be secured.</p>"
