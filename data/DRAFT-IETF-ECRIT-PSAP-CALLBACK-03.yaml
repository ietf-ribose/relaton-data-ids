abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated\n
    \  by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible\n   that
    the call-taker feels the need for further communication.  For\n   example, the
    call may have been dropped by accident without the call-\n   taker having sufficient
    information about the current situation of a\n   wounded person.  A call-taker
    may trigger a callback towards the\n   emergency caller using the contact information
    provided with the\n   initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain\n
    \  circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it\n   may
    get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an\n   answering
    machine.\n\n   The IETF emergency services architecture offers capabilities to
    allow\n   callbask to bypass authorization policies to reach the caller without\n
    \  unnecessary delays.  However, the mechanism specified prior to this\n   document
    supports only limited scenarios.  This document discusses\n   some shortcomings,
    presents additional scenarios where better-than-\n   normal call treatment behavior
    would be desirable, and specifies a\n   protocol solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
