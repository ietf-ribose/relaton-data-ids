abstract:
  content: "<p>This document identifies (OR BETTER: specifies) protocol enhancementsthat
    enable mobile nodes to more quickly become connected at newpoints of attachment
    to the Internet. These protocol enhancementsare intended to minimize the time
    during which the mobile node isunable to send or receive IPv6 packets (i.e., the
    handover latency).Mobile IPv6 is considered to be the base protocol, but MobileIPv6
    does not mandate any mechanism which gives assurances aboutminimizing the handover
    latency. The protocol enhancements in thisdocument should be considered as protocol
    enhancements to MobileIPv6.</p>"
