abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in the context of a Path Computation Element (PCE).
    This grouping can then be used to define associations between sets of LSPs or
    between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters
    or behaviors), and it is equally applicable to the stateful PCE (active and passive
    modes) and the stateless PCE.</p>"
