abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  There is no capability negotiation done for Label Distribution\n
    \ Protocol (LDP) applications that setup Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for\n  IP
    prefixes or that signal Point-to-point (P2P) Pseudowires (PWs) for\n  Layer 2
    Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs). When an LDP session comes\n  up, an LDP speaker
    may unnecessarily advertise its local state for\n  such LDP applications even
    when the peer session is established for\n  some other applications like Multipoint
    LDP (mLDP) or Inter-Chassis\n  Communication Protocol (ICCP). This document defines
    a solution by\n  which an LDP speaker announces to its peer its disinterest in
    such\n  non-negotiated applications, thus disabling the unnecessary\n  advertisement
    of corresponding application state, which would have\n  otherwise be advertised
    over the established LDP session.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
