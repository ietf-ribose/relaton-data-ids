abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The current draft for HTTP Home Documents provides a JSON syntax\n
    \  only.  This draft provides an XML syntax for the same underlying data\n   model,
    so that the concept of HTTP Home Documents can be consistently\n   exposed in
    both JSON- and XML-based HTTP services.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   Please discuss
    this draft on the apps-discuss mailing list [1].\n\n   Online access to all versions
    and files is available on github [2].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
