abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines an OS independent rule language as a mean
    to\ndefine and perform per flow path selection for a multi-homed node.\nPer flow
    path selection is typically needed when there exist multiple\nnetwork interfaces,
    each with different network characteristics, and\nan application has specific
    performance requirements for a data flow\nthat makes one network interface more
    suitable than another.\n\nThe flow distribution rule set is used by the node itself
    but also\nexchanged with other nodes that needs to know about the multi-homed\nnode's
    capability of receiving data on multiple network interfaces.\nThis document does
    not define how the rule set is transferred between\nnodes.\n\t </p>\n      "
