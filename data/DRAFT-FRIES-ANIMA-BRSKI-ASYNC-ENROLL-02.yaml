abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses an enhancement of automated bootstrapping
    of\n   a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to operate in domains\n   featuring
    no or only timely limited connectivity to backend services\n   offering enrollment
    functionality, specifically a Public Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI).  In the context
    of deploying new devices the\n   design of BRSKI allows for online (synchronous
    object exchange) and\n   offline interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with
    a\n   manufacturer's authorization service.  For this it utilizes a self-\n   contained
    voucher to transport the domain credentials as a signed\n   object to establish
    an initial trust between a pledge and the target\n   deployment domain.  The currently
    supported enrollment protocol for\n   request and distribution of deployment domain
    specific device\n   certificates provides only limited support for asynchronous
    PKI\n   interactions.  This memo motivates the enhancement of supporting\n   self-contained
    objects for certificate management by using an\n   abstract notation.  This allows
    off-site operation of PKI services\n   outside the deployment domain of the pledge.
    \ This addresses\n   specifically scenarios, in which the final authorization
    of\n   certification request of a pledge cannot be made in the deployment\n   domain
    and is therefore delegated to a operator backend.  The goal is\n   to enable the
    usage of existing and potentially new PKI protocols\n   supporting self-containment
    for certificate management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
