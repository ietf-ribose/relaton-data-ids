  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a set of extensions needed to the stateful
    Path\n   Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as to\n   enable
    Labeled Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation\n   and LSP setup/deletion
    based on the actual network resource usage and\n   the duration of a traffic service
    in a centralized network\n   environment as stated in RFC 8413.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
