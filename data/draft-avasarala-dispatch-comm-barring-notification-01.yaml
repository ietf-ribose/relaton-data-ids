abstract:
  content: "<p>3GPP is defining the protocol specification for the CommunicationBarring
    (CB) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)subsystem supplementary
    service and more particularly the dynamicincoming communication barring service.
    As part of dynamic incomingcommunication barring (ICB) service, a SIP based Event
    packageframework is used for notifying users about communication barrings(dynamic
    and rule based) of their incoming communication sessions.This document proposes
    a new SIP event package for allowing users tosubscribe to and receive such notifications.
    Users can furtherdefine filters to control the rate and content of such notifications.The
    proposed event package is applicable to the ICB supplementaryservice in IMS and
    may not be applicable to the general internet..</p>"
