abstract:
- content: '<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model describes
    a mechanism that allows two entities to negotiate a multimedia session. The SDP
    syntax of the Offer/Answer model uses constructs known as media (m=) lines to
    describe each medium. In SDP itself these "m=" lines were designed to describe
    RTP sessions with any number of streams (SSRCs). Yet, Offer/Answer implementations
    in SIP applications have most often used them as an envelope for a maximum of
    two RTP streams (SSRCs) at a time: one in each direction. The most common reason
    for this has been the fact these applications could not meaningfully render multiple
    SSRCs simultaneously. The above situation has led to difficulties once the need
    to represent multiple (SSRCs) in an interoperable manner became more common. This
    document explores the use of "m=" lines for the negotiation of sessions with multiple
    media sources, as per their original design in SDP. It presents the advantages
    of such an approach as well as the challenges that it implies in terms of interoperability
    with already deployed legacy devices. The model described here was first presented
    in the RTCWEB No Plan proposal. The reason to spin it off into this new document
    is mainly to separate the parts related to Offer/Answer and "m=" line semantics,
    from those that are specific to WebRTC.</p>'
