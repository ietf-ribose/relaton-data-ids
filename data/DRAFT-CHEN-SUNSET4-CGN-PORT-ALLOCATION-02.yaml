abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The document enumerates methods of port assignment in CGN contexts,\n
    \  more focusing on a NAT64 environment.  The analysis categorizes the\n   different
    methods with several key features.  The uses of existing\n   protocols are further
    described corresponding to those features.\n   This memo also states the port-usage
    experiences, relevant findings,\n   evaluations and workarounds.  It's expected
    the document could\n   provide an informative base line to help operators choosing
    a proper\n   method.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
