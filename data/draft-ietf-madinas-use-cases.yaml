abstract:
- content: "<p>To limit the association between a device, its traffic, its location
    and its user, client vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation. When
    such rotation happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network
    efficiency and the user experience. At the same time, devices may continue sending
    other stable identifiers, defeating the MAC rotation purposes. This document lists
    various network environments and a set of network services that may be affected
    by such rotation. This document then examines settings and use cases where the
    user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption, and settings where
    other machine identifiers may expose the user privacy. Last, this document examines
    solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience
    and network operation efficiency.</p>"
