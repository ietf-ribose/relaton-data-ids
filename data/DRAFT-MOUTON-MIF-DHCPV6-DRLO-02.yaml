abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an experimental DHCPv6 default route
    option\n   which provisions static routing information to client nodes.  The\n
    \  option facilitates central configuration of a multi-access client\n   node's
    default router list with the IPv6 address, MAC address, and\n   lifetime of the
    route, which is preferred in certain multi-access\n   network environments.  In
    addition, the DHCP option defined in this\n   document can provide operational
    simplicity in network coverage\n   extension scenarios using inexpensive (and
    limited resource)\n   consumer-grade equipment.  Finally, the proposed DHCP option
    has been\n   implemented and tested in practice; its experimental use points to\n
    \  benefits with respect to reduced signaling and energy consumption\n   compared
    to existing default route configuration mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
