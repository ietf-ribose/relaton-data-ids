abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this paper we discuss various security issues concerning Mobile\nHosts
    using Mobile-IP or other mobility systems (DHCP standalone)\nand current firewall
    technology.  We first present some recent\nattacks on the Internet and what they
    might mean for mobile systems\nlike Mobile-IP that rely on tunneling technologies.
    \ We point out\nthat tunnels are a security threat and suggest how mobile systems\nmay
    be made 'less insecure' with the use of IP layer security\n(IPSEC) as one means
    for creating Virtual Private Networks.  The\ngoal is to describe a security model
    wherein mobile systems can\nwork across the Internet and not just as an interior
    routing protocol\nwithin one security and/or interior routing domain.  Both the\nprotection
    of Mobile Systems abroad and of Security Enclaves that\ntolerate mobile visitors
    must be considered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
