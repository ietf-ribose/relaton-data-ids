abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)and RESTCONF provides mechanisms
    to manipulate configuration datastores. NMDA introduces additional datastores
    for systems that support more advanced processing chains converting configuration
    to operational state. However, client applications are not able to be aware of
    common events in these additional datstores of the management system, such as
    a applied configuration state change in NETCONF server or RESTCONF server, that
    may impact management applications. This document define a YANG module that allows
    a client to receive additional notifications for some common system events pertaining
    to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].</p>"
