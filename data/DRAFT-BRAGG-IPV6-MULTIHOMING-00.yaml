abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IPv6 Addressing scheme mandates provider addressing to achieve\naggregation.
    \ Multi-homing is a fact of life.  Current proposals to\nreconcile these requirements
    involve mitigation, by constraining\ndeployment topologies to avoid loss of aggregation
    in the backbone\nonly.  This draft views the combined requirement as equivalent
    to\nthe use of loose source routing by hosts, and makes some outline\nproposals
    as to how this can be achieved.\n\t </p>\n      "
