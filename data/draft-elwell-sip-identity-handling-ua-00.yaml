abstract:
  content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UA) receiveidentifiers
    for the caller and callee during call establishment.These identifiers can come
    in a variety of forms, can be delivered bya variety of means, and may or may not
    be accompanied by evidence ofauthenticity. Furthermore, if media are secured (e.g.,
    using theSecure Real-Time Protocol, SRTP), the security properties of themedia
    will depend on binding the media to a received authenticatedidentifier. This document
    examines the various identificationinformation a UA can receive during call establishment
    and how a useragent can use this information to present a caller or calleeidentifier
    to the user and indicate to the user the securityproperties of the call, as well
    as how the user agent might use thisinformation for other purposes, such as authorizing
    acceptance of acall.This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
