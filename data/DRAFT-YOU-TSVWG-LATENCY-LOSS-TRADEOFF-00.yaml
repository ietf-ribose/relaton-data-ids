abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a PHB (Per-Hop Behavior) group called
    Latency\n   Loss Tradeoff (LLT).  The LLT group is intended to provide delivery\n
    \  of IP packets in two classes of services: a low-loss service (Lo\n   service)
    and a low-latency service (La service).  The LLT group\n   enables an application
    to request treatment for either low-loss or\n   low-latency at a congested network
    link.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
