abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is commonly acknowledged that one of the issues raised by
    the\n   current Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) design is that some\n   packets
    are likely to be lost in specific situations such as the\n   absence of a mapping
    entry in the mapping cache maintained by an ITR.\n   This issue is usually referred
    to as the \"first packet loss\" problem.\n\n   This document specifies a new LISP
    capability called Triggered Map-\n   Request which aims at addressing the \"first
    packet loss\" issue.\n   Also, it proposes to extend the LISP mapping entries
    with names\n   instead of achieving RLOC resolution based upon EID prefixes only.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
