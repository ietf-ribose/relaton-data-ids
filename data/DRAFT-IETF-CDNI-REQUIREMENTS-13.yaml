abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for content\n
    \  delivery.  As a result of significant growth in content delivered\n   over
    IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their\n   infrastructure.  Many
    Network Service Providers and Enterprise\n   Service Providers are also deploying
    their own CDNs.  To deliver\n   contents from the Content Service Provider (CSP)
    to end users, the\n   contents may traverse across multiple CDNs.  This creates
    a need for\n   interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so that they can\n
    \  collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the\n   end
    users.\n\n   The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for\n
    \  the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working\n   group.\n\n\t
