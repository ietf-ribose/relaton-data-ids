abstract:
- content: "<p>It is expected that a future version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport
    will allow protocol extensions to be defined. This would provide for the specification
    of OPTIONAL features allowing participants who implement such features to cooperate
    as specified by that extension, while still interoperating with participants who
    do not support that extension. A particular extension is described herein, whose
    motivation is to reduce the latency due to inter-node round-trips needed to effect
    operations which involve direct data placement or which transfer RPC messages
    longer than the fixed inline buffer size limit.</p>"
