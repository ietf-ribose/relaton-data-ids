abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records
    as\na means to authorize Third-Party domains.  This mechanism allows\nfirst-party
    domains to autonomously authorize a range of third-party\ndomains in a scalable,
    individual DNS transaction.  This\nauthorization extends the scope of DKIM policy
    assertions to supplant\nmore difficult to administer mechanisms.  Alternatives
    for\nfacilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate the\ncoordination
    between two or more domains by setting up selector/key\nDNS records, DNS zone
    delegations, or the regular exchange of public/\nprivate keys.\n\nChecking DKIM
    policies may occur when a From header email-address is\nnot within the domain
    of a valid DKIM signature.  When a Third-Party\nsignature is found, TPA-labels
    offer an efficient means for email\naddress domains to authorize specific third-party
    signing domains.\nThe scope of the authorization may separately assert identity\nauthentication
    for From and Sender and Resent-* headers for email-\naddresses within the authorizing
    domain.  Identity authentication can\nbe asserted by the scope of the authorization,
    even when signed by a\nThird-Party domain.  In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom
    domain can\nauthorize domains for controlling DSNs.\n\t </p>\n      "
