abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>NAT-PT (RFC2766) is an address translation mechanism designed
    to \nfacilitate communications between IPv6-only and IPv4-only nodes.  \nThis
    mechanism was designed to be used when tunneling transition \nmechanisms cannot
    be used.   \nThis document is intended to be a compilation of known security \nissues
    related to NAT-PT and includes a few new ones.  These issues \nare discussed in
    some detail, and suggestions on how to deal with \nthem are included in this document.
    \n\t </p>\n      "
