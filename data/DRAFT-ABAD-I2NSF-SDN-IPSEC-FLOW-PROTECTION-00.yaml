abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based
    flow\n   protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller\n
    \  and raises the requirements to support this service.  It considers\n   two
    main scenarios: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-gateway\n   (Road Warrior).
    \ For the gateway-to-gateway scenario, this document\n   describes a mechanism
    to support the distribution of IPsec\n   information to flow-based Network Security
    Functions (NSFs) that\n   implements IPsec to protect data traffic.  between network
    resources\n   to protect data traffic with IPsec and IKE, in intra and inter-SDN\n
    \  cases.  The host-to-gateway case defines a mechanism to distribute\n   IPsec
    information to the NSF to protect data with IPsec between an\n   end user's device
    (host) and a gateway.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
