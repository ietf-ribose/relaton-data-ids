abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates a base set of requirements to be included
    in any system that provides registration information for Internet registration
    entities, i.e., network and/or domain name assignments. Some of these, in turn,
    will define requirements for registrars; this, however, is an issue outside of
    the scope of this document. It is hoped that this work will also influence the
    development of requirements and specifications for domain name registries at some
    point in the future.</p>"
