abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the labelswapping
    forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliverreliable service, MPLS
    requires a set of procedures to provideprotection of the traffic carried on different
    paths. This requiresthat the label switched routers (LSRs) support fault detection,fault
    notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLSsignaling [2] [3] [4]
    [5] [6] support the configuration of recovery.With these objectives in mind, this
    document specifies a frameworkfor MPLS based recovery.</p>"
