abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud services are revolutionizing the way computational resources\n
    \  are provided, but at the expense of requiring an even more\n   revolutionary
    overhaul of the networking infrastructure needed to\n   deliver them.  Much recent
    work has focused on intra- and inter-\n   datacenter connectivity requirements
    and architectures, while the\n   \"access segment\" connecting the cloud services
    user to the datacenter\n   still needs to be addressed.  In this draft we consider
    tighter\n   integration between the network and the datacenter, in order to\n
    \  improve end-to-end Quality of Experience, while minimizing both\n   networking
    and computational resource costs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
