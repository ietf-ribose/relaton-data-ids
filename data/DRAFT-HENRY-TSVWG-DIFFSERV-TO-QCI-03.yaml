abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices
    include\n   more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries\n   between
    telecommunication and other applications becomes less clear.\n   Simultaneously,
    as the end-devices become more mobile, application\n   traffic transits more often
    between enterprise networks, the\n   Internet, and cellular telecommunication
    networks, sometimes using\n   simultaneously more than one path and network type.
    \ In this context,\n   it is crucial that quality of service be aligned between
    these\n   different environments.  However, this is not always the case by\n   default,
    and cellular communication networks use a different QoS\n   nomenclature from
    the Internet and enterprise networks.  This\n   document specifies a set of 3rd
    Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n   Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifiers
    (QCI) and 5G QoS\n   Identifiers (5QI) to Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)\n
    \  mappings, to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the\n   3GPP
    with the recommendations offered by the IETF, so as to maintain\n   a consistent
    QoS treatment between cellular networks and the\n   Internet.  This mapping can
    be used by enterprises or implementers\n   expecting traffic to flow through both
    types of network, and wishing\n   to align the QoS treatment applied to one network
    under their control\n   with the QoS treatment applied to the other network.\n\n\t
