abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs)
    as a\nsolution for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of-\nService
    (QoS) on an Internet-wide scale. A VSN is a single-domain\noverlay network that
    consists of guaranteed QoS pipes. VSNs of\nneighboring domains that offer the
    same level of QoS establish\npeering relationships. As such, they form a network
    of QoS-enabled\nnetworks with a specific (QoS) routing context. In this network,\nadmission
    control for traffic flows is performed in two phases. The\ntwo-phase approach
    allows for the use of an off-path signaling\nprotocol, which enables the gradual
    introduction of this\narchitecture without changing the existing routers.\n\t
