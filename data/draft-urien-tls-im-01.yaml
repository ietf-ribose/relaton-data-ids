abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS 1.3 will be deployed in the Internet of Things ecosystem. In many
    IoT frameworks, TLS or DTLS protocols, based on pre-shared key (PSK), are used
    for device authentication. So PSK tamper resistance, is a critical market request,
    in order to prevent hijacking issues. If DH exchange is used with certificate
    bound to DH ephemeral public key, there is also a benefit to protect its signature
    procedure. The TLS identity module (im) MAY be based on secure element; it realizes
    some HKDF operations bound to PSK, and cryptographic signature if certificates
    are used. Secure Element form factor could be standalone chip, or embedded in
    SOC like eSIM.</p>"
