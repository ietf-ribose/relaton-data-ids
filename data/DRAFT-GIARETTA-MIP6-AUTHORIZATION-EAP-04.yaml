abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines an architecture, and related protocols,
    for \n   performing dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration \n   relying
    on a AAA infrastructure. The necessary interaction between \n   the AAA server
    of the home provider and the mobile node is \n   realized using EAP, exploiting
    the capability of some EAP methods \n   to convey generic information items together
    with authentication \n   data. This approach has the advantage that the access
    equipment \n   acts as a simple pass-through for EAP messages and therefore does
    \n   not play any active role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation procedure, \n   which
    makes the solution easier to deploy and maintain. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
