abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a generic routing method and protocol for
    a\n   regular data center network, named as the fault-avoidance routing\n   (FAR)
    protocol.  FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for\n   all types of
    network architectures that are proposed for large-scale\n   cloud-based data centers
    over the past few years.  FAR protocol is\n   well designed to fully leverage
    the regularity in the topology and\n   compute its routing table in a simplistic
    manner.  Fat-tree is taken\n   as an example architecture to illustrate how FAR
    protocol can be\n   applied in real operational scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
