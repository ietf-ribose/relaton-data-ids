abstract:
  content: "<p>RFC 2026 and some of its predecessors require that Proposed and DraftStandards
    either advance in grade within a reasonable period of timeor that they expire
    and be moved to Historic. That procedure hasnever been followed on a systematic
    basis. A new procedure has beenproposed that would make that action easier for
    protocols that havenot gotten any real acceptance. In the interest of symmetry,fairness,
    and an orderly attic, it is worth noting that there are anumber of protocol descriptions
    which have been at less than FullStandard level for a long time but which have
    proven their value bythe traditional criteria of multiple interoperable implementationsThis
    document provides a procedure for upgrading such documents toFull Standards without
    creating an unreasonable burden on authorspurely to meet the needs of procedural
    rituals or placing anunreasonable load on groups charged with performing other
    tasks inthe IETF.</p>"
