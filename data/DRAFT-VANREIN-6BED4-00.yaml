abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications,
    even on\n   IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-\n
    \  peer protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat\n   session.
    \ Such protocols are designed to run in any environment,\n   which means that
    they cannot rely on IPv6 for themselves, or for\n   their peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel
    mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be\n   assumed on all peers.\n\n   The 6bed4 mechanism
    is meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6\n   connectivity on networks that do
    not support it natively, by running\n   a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4
    address is used to support\n   traceability of the traffic originator, which means
    that no user\n   account or other configuration is needed.\n\n   The tunnel mechanism
    encapsulates IPv6 in UDP/IPv4 and builds on\n   existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs
    Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address on
    a 6bed4 Peer,\n   and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the most direct route
    to a\n   remote 6bed4 Peer.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
