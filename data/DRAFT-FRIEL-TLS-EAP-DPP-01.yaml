abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a TLS extension that enables a server
    to prove\n   to a client that it has knowledge of the public key of a key pair\n
    \  where the client has knowledge of the private key of the key pair.\n   Unlike
    standard TLS key exchanges, the public key is never exchanged\n   in TLS protocol
    messages.  Proof of knowledge of the public key is\n   used by the client to bootstrap
    trust in the server.  The use case\n   outlined in this document is to establish
    trust in an EAP server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
