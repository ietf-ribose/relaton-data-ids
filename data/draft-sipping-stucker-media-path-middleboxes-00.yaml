abstract:
  content: "<p>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functionsapart
    from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the datapath between a source
    host and destination host. Two such functionsare network address translation and
    firewalling.When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact withNATs
    and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, thenproblems may occur
    in the transport of media traffic when signalingprotocol interaction takes place
    along the media path, as it is thecase for recent key exchange proposals (such
    as DTLS-SRTP). Thisdocument highlights problems that may arise. Unfortunately,
    it isdifficult for the end points to detect or predict problematicbehavior and
    to determine whether the media path is reliablyavailable for packet exchange.This
    document aims to summarize the various sources and effects ofNAT and firewall
    control, the reasons that they exist, and possiblemeans of improving their behavior
    to allow protocols that rely uponsignaling along the media path to operate effectively.</p>"
