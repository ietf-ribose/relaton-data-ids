abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are several reasons for operators to construct multicast
    trees\nby another means than multicast routing protocols.  This document\nlists
    these reasons and describes 2 ways of building a multicast\ntraffic-engineered
    tree: root-initiated tree and leaf-initiated tree.\nFinally it defines extensions
    to CR-LDP to support MPLS multicast\ntraffic engineering.\n\t </p>\n      "
