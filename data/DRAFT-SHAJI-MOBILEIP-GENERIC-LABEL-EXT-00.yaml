abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is regarding extended label distribution method
    using \nMobile IP registration and binding protocols. The document specifies \na
    novel method in which the label mapping information for a \nparticular mobile
    registration is piggybacked or placed in the same \nMobile IP registration request
    and response message. To apply this \nsame method to the route optimization protocol
    in Mobile IP, the \nlabel mapping information is piggybacked or placed in the
    binding \nupdate request message. The label mapping information is carried \nusing
    Mobile IP registration extensions. The document also addresses \nthe applicability
    of this label distribution method in GRE, MPLS and \nIPv6 networks.\n\t </p>\n
