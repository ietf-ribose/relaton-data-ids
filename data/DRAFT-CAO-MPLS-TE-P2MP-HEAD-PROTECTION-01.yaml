abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Protection methods for RSVP-TE P2MP LSP have been described in
    [TE-\nFRR]([RFC4090]) and [P2MP-TE-Bypass], but there are no solutions to \nprotect
    an RSVP-TE P2MP head node. This document discusses the \nscenario for RSVP-TE
    P2MP LSP head node failure protection and \ndescribes the protection procedures.
    RSVP-TE extensions for such \nprotection are also described. \n\nTo protect the
    head node, a backup head node is appointed which \nforwards traffic to downstream
    LSRs of the LSP when the protected \nhead node fails. The backup head node is
    not on the path of protected \nLSP. Similar to [TE-FRR] there are two methods
    that can apply: one-\n \n \n to-one backup and facility backup. Only one-to-one
    backup is \ndescribed in detail here, facility backup will be discussed in a \nfuture
    version of this draft. \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\t </p>\n      "
