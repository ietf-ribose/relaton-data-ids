abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Distributed Component Object Model protocol is an application-level\nprotocol
    for object-oriented remote procedure calls useful for distributed,\ncomponent-based
    systems of all types. It is a generic protocol layered on the\ndistributed computing
    environment (DCE) RPC specification and facilitates the\nconstruction of task-specific
    communication protocols through features such\nas: a platform neutral argument/parameter
    marshaling format (NDR), the\nability for objects to support multiple interfaces
    with a safe, interface-\nlevel versioning scheme suited to independent evolution
    by multiple parties,\nthe ability to make authenticated connections and to choose
    levels of channel\nsecurity, and a transport-neutral data representation for references\n(including
    by-value) to objects.\n\t </p>\n      "
