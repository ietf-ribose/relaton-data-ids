abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows User Agents to
    register\n   for inbound requests.  However, the existence of firewalls and\n
    \  Network Address Translators (NATs) prevent servers from reaching the\n   User
    Agents unless the User Agents keep connections to the server\n   alive.\n\n   To
    keep such connections alive User Agents employ various methods,\n   most of which
    require constant uptime resulting in high energy cost.\n   This is especially
    a problem on mobile platforms that operate\n   entirely on battery power.  To
    resolve these issues many mobile\n   manufacturers have provided a cost effective
    way of pushing messages\n   to their devices.\n\n   This specification defines
    behaviors for User Agents, registrars and\n   proxy servers that allow a User
    Agent to provide a Push Notification\n   Configuration to its Registrar.\n\n\t
