abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>International Email Addresses (IEA) are far from the global reality.
    The\ncurrent de-facto language of the Internet is English.  Even today, many\nof
    the users of the Internet do not speak English as their primary\nlanguage.  The
    next billion users of the Internet are likely to be even\nless familiar with English.
    IEA is probably the first application needed\nin a truly internationalized Internet.
    \  The Email Address\nInternationalization (EAI) Working Group defined the RFCs
    to support\ninternationalized email.  The time may now finally have come to develop\nbest
    practices and to discuss the deployment challenges for IEA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
