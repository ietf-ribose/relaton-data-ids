abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document specifies procedure for sending and processing probe query and response
    messages for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure
    uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
    Light) and Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) for Delay Measurement,
    and also uses the mechanisms defined in this document for Loss Measurement. The
    procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and are used
    for both links and end-to-end SR Policies.</p>"
