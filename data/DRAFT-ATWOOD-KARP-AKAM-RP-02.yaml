abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure,
    two\n   steps are necessary.  The first is to secure the routing protocols'\n
    \  packets on the wire.  The second is to ensure that the keying\n   material
    for the routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to\n   the appropriate
    routers.  This document specifies requirements on\n   that distribution and proposes
    the use of a set of protocols to\n   achieve those requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n
