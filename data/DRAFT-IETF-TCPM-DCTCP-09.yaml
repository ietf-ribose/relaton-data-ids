abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This informational memo describes Datacenter TCP (DCTCP), a
    TCP\n   congestion control scheme for datacenter traffic.  DCTCP extends the\n
    \  Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the\n   fraction
    of bytes that encounter congestion, rather than simply\n   detecting that some
    congestion has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the\n   TCP congestion window based
    on this estimate.  This method achieves\n   high burst tolerance, low latency,
    and high throughput with shallow-\n   buffered switches.  This memo also discusses
    deployment issues\n   related to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP,
    the lack of\n   a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver, and presents\n
    \  some possible mitigations.  This memo documents DCTCP as currently\n   implemented
    by several major operating systems.  DCTCP as described\n   in this draft is applicable
    to deployments in controlled environments\n   like datacenters but it must not
    be deployed over the public Internet\n   without additional measures.\n\n\t </p>\n
