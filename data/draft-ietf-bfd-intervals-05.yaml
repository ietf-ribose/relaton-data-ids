abstract:
- content: <p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) requires that messages be transmitted
    at regular intervals and provides a way to negotiate the interval used by BFD
    peers. Some BFD implementations may be restricted to only support several interval
    values. When such BFD implementations speak to each other, there is a possibility
    of two sides not being able to find a common value for the interval to run BFD
    sessions. This document updates RFC 5880 by defining a small set of interval values
    for BFD that we call "Common Intervals" and recommends implementations to support
    the defined intervals. This solves the problem of finding an interval value that
    both BFD speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation as seen
    for hardware-based BFD. It does not restrict an implementation from supporting
    more intervals in addition to the Common Intervals.</p>
