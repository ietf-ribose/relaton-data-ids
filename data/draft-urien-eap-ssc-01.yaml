abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a means of setting up an EAP secured channel
    between a Smart Card SC and an Authentication Server AS (e. g. RADIUS server),
    as well according to an asymmetric key exchange model as a symmetric key exchange
    model. This channel permits to convey in secure all other types of payload between
    the SC and the AS, for example the commands which can setup or update the Directory
    Information Base (DIB) associated to the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    in the Smart Card.</p>"
