abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 4893 defines BGP support for four-octet AS number space for handling
    AS_PATH attributes and "My ASN" value in BGP OPEN messages. Foue-Octet AS specific
    Extended Community attribute formats are defined in draft-rekhter-as4octet-ext-community-03.txt.
    However, an implementation compliant to RFC 4893 does not necessarily provide
    support for 4-Octet Route-distinguisher, Route-target or Site-of- origin in the
    BGP-MPLS-VPN. Thus BGP capability exchange for extended AS number attribute does
    not cover the BGP-MPLS-VPN AS4- specific route-attributes and route-distinguishers.
    This document proposes an optional BGP capability exchange between the Provider
    Edge (PE) routers in order to communicate the intention of handling 4-Octet or
    2-Octet exteneded AS-specific Route-targets or Site-of- Origins or being able
    to handle and inteprete the 4-Octet route- distinguishers correctly. This capability
    parameter will be part of OPEN message during the BGP session initiation.</p>
