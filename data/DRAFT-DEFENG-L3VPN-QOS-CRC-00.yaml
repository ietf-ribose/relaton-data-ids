abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document focuses on the QoS problem in NBVPN, analyses
    the QoS\n   requirement for NBVPN, the insufficiency of QoS guarantee in the\n
    \  current NBVPN schemes in the related IETF work group, and proposes\n   a QoS-guaranteed
    NBVPN reference model with centralized resource\n   controller, in this model,
    some new concepts are introduced,\n   such as VPN Logical Bearer Network(VPN-LBN),
    VPN Centralized\n   resource controller(VPN-CRC); and mechanism of guaranteeing
    the VPN\n   QoS is explained in details, including address space, isolation\n
    \  between VPNs, VPN route distribution, forwarding, interface\n   requirement
    signaling requirement, hybrid QoS-VPN, intra-domain VPN,\n   inter-domain VPN.\n\n\t
