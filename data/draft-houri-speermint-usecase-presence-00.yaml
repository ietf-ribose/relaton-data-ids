abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes several use cases for peering between two or
    more communities that provide real time communications services and presence and
    IM in particular. The communities create a peering relationship between themselves
    thus enabling their users to collaborate with users on other communities. The
    target of the document is to help understanding the requirements for peering between
    domains with regard to real time services</p>"
