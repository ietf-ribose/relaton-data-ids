abstract:
- content: "<p>A Verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (VOPRF) is a two-party
    protocol for computing the output of a PRF that is symmetrically verifiable. In
    summary, the PRF key holder learns nothing of the input while simultaneously providing
    proof that its private key was used during execution. VOPRFs are useful for computing
    one-time unlinkable tokens that are verifiable by secret key holders. This document
    specifies a VOPRF construction instantiated within prime- order subgroups, including
    elliptic curves.</p>"
