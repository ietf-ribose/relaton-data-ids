abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which
    uses a\nDNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server.  The http+srv scheme operates\nin
    the same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS\nlookup that a http
    scheme would use, it first tries an DNS SRV\nlookup.  This memo also defines a
    https+srv scheme that operates in\nthe same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV
    lookups.\n\nThe draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
