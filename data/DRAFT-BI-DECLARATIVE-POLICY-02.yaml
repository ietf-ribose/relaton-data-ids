    the user's\n   declarative on network policy. The declarative policy model is
    a specific data\n   model specifies the desired state of the network system. It
    helps the service\n   management to model the policy (a set of states described
    by constraints) that\n   defines the final results of a VPN service without specifying
    how it is\n   monitored and managed during its lifecycle. One application for
    Distributed\n   Data Center (DDC) scenarios with policy enforcement is provided
    with details of\n   how to convert high level declarative policy into lower level
    configurations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
