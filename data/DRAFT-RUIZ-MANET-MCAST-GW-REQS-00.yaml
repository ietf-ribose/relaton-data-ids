abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is formed by the spontaneous
    \n   association of wireless and mobile devices capable of communicating \n   among
    them even when there is no networking infrastructure \n   available. Several unicast
    Internet gateway mechanisms have been \n   proposed within the IETEF MANET WG.
    However, the particular nature \n   of the IP Multicast model poses some additional
    requirements which \n   need to be satisfied by candidate solutions. This document
    aims at \n   identifying the requirements that a multicast solution for MANET
    \n   interworking with a fixed IP Multicast network should satisfy. \n\t </p>\n
