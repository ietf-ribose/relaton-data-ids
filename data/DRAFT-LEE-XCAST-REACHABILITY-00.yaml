abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It can be important to know which node has Explicit multicast\nreceivability
    and routability before sending a large amount of data\ntraffic in Explicit multicast.
    This document provides how to test\nthe receivability and routability, in short,
    the reachability of\nExplicit multicast packets to a particular node.\n\n\t </p>\n
