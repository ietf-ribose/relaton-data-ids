abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an internet draft for extensions to TIFF-FX [RFC XXXX],
    extension set 1. This draft describes extensions to RFC XXXX to enable new features
    or conditions to TIFF-FX. The features are described by a set of guidelines for
    all TIFF-FX extensions, and a set of 5 extension types which enable: increased
    resolutions and image widths, expanding Profile M from 3 layers to N layers, the
    use of shared resources as a general mechanism for sharing data across images
    and pages, a binary profile for JBIG2 coding, and an extension to Profile M for
    JBIG2 and colour tag coding. The IETF has been notified of intellectual property
    rights claimed in regard to some or all of the specification contained in this
    document. For more information consult the online list of claimed rights in &lt;http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html&gt;.</p>"
