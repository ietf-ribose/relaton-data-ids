abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the architecture of remote service\n
    \  installation and configuration in the provider's network through a\n   centralized
    management system.  This is a typical scenario for\n   virtual network function
    installation and dynamic configuration in\n   network function virtualization
    (NFV) context.  It is also a typical\n   scenario in cloud computing environment
    where end users do not have\n   to install applications on their end hosts, but
    can install their own\n   featured powerful software application in the cloud.
    \ This\n   specification describes an architecture of virtual network function\n
    \  installation and configuration.  It is also applicable to other use\n   cases
    with similar requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
