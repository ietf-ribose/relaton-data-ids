abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to uncontrolled interferences, including the self-induced multipath
    fading, deterministic networking can only be approached on wireless links. The
    radio conditions may change -way- faster than a centralized routing can adapt
    and reprogram, in particular when the controller is distant and connectivity is
    slow and limited. RAW separates the routing time scale at which a complex path
    is recomputed from the forwarding time scale at which the forwarding decision
    is taken for an individual packet. RAW operates at the forwarded time scale. The
    RAW problem is to decide, within the redundant solutions that are proposed by
    the routing, which will be used for each individual packet to provide a DetNet
    service while minimizing the waste of resources.</p>"
