abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture named \"Cloud of Secure\n
    \  Elements (CoSE)\" whose goal is to strengthen the Internet trust. A\n   Secure
    element (SE) provides secure services thanks to various means\n   such as tamper
    resistant technologies or software virtualization\n   techniques. Secure elements
    are hosted in dedicated servers (i.e.\n   Trusted Secure Elements Servers, TSES);
    they provide secure storage\n   facilities or compute cryptographic procedures.
    Secure elements\n   resources are identified by dedicated URIs and should also
    support\n   HTTP interface. Users are equipped with \"Access Credential\" and\n
    \  thanks to the Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) remotely access\n   to Secure
    Element embedded resources. The RACS (Remote APDU Call\n   Secure) and its associated
    framework protocol is an early proof of\n   concept of the CoSE concept.\n\n\n\t
