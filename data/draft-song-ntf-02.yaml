abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests the necessity of an architectural framework
    for network telemetry in order to meet the current and future network operation
    requirements. The defining characteristics of network telemetry shows a clear
    distinction from the conventional network OAM concept; hence the network telemetry
    demands new techniques and protocols. This document clarifies the terminologies
    and classifies the categories and components of a network telemetry framework.
    The requirements, challenges, existing solutions, and future directions are discussed
    for each category. The network telemetry framework and the taxonomy help to set
    a common ground for the collection of related works and put future technique and
    standard developments into perspective.</p>"
