abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing is considered as an important approach to provide different
    services and customers with the required network connectivity, network resources
    and performance characteristics over a shared network. Operators have started
    the deployment of network slices in their networks for different purposes. This
    document introduces several deployment cases of IETF network slices in operator
    networks. Some considerations collected from these IETF network slice deployments
    are also provided.</p>"
