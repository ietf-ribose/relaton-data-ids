abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths of amultihomed
    SCTP association at the same moment while keepingcongestion control per path.
    The document also describes a possiblesolution to multihoming which would require
    no routing tables on thehost and which would try to guarantee non-overlapping
    multihomedpaths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the routing table in arouter.
    The selection of which link to take would be a localone. The solution is similar
    to the use of links and linksets withina routeset in SS7.</p>"
