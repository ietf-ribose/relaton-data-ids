abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a lightweight method for cryptographically\n
    \  protecting a portion of the contents of a Diameter message in transit\n   between
    an arbitrary pair of Diameter nodes.  The scheme assumes that\n   the destination
    node possesses an X.509 certificate containing an RSA\n   public key and that
    that certificate is retrievable through a DNS\n   query by the node originating
    the message.\n\n   In addition to describing the operation of the protocol, this
    note\n   specifies an Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) for the encapsulation of\n   encrypted
    AVPs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
