abstract:
- content: <p>Recently, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks
    that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar
    protocols. The consequences of these attacks range from throughput-reduction to
    broken connections or data corruption. These attacks rely on the attacker's ability
    to guess or know the four- tuple (Source Address, Destination Address, Source
    port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be
    attacked. This document describes a simple and efficient method for random selection
    of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the
    exact value is reduced. While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods,
    the described port number randomization algorithms provide improved security/obfuscation
    with very little effort and without any key management overhead.</p>
