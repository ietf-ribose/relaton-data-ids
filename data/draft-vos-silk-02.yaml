abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes SILK, a speech codec for real-time, packet-based
    voice communications. Targeting a diverse range of operatingenvironments, SILK
    provides scalability in several dimensions. Fourdifferent sampling frequencies
    are supported for encoding the audioinput signal. Adaptation to network characteristics
    is providedthrough control of bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience anduse
    of discontinuous transmission (DTX). And several differentcomplexity levels let
    SILK take advantage of available processingpower without relying on it. Each of
    these properties can beadjusted during operation of the codec on a frame-by-frame
    basis.</p>"
