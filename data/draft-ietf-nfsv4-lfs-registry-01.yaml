abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very rigid
    policies which were implemented in particular protocols and platforms. As MAC
    systems became more widely deployed, additional flexibility in mechanism and policy
    will be required. While traditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security
    (MLS) and integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies
    such as type enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms which
    need to be accommodated, it is unlikely that use of a single security label format
    and model will be viable. To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to
    co-exist in a network, this document proposes a registry of label format specifications.
    This registry would contain label format identifiers and would provide for the
    association of each such identifier with a corresponding extensive document document
    outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label format.</p>"
