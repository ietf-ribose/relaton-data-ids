abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type
    for\n   BGP, termed \"One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", which\n
    \  would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh\n   request
    with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer\n   send only the
    specific routes matching the filters to the speaker.\n   This ORF-type enables
    a BGP speaker to re-advertise some specific\n   routes without the need of advertising
    the whole Adj-RIB-Out of a\n   specific address family, which makes the route
    recovery and trouble\n   shooting operation more efficient and also reduces the
    impact on\n   network stability.  This filter does not change the outbound route\n
    \  filters or policies on the BGP peer and should only be used for one-\n   time
    route filtering.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
