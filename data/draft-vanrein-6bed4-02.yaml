abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on
    IPv4-only networks. A specific and new [RFC7059] area of concern is that of peer-to-peer
    protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat session. Such protocols
    are designed to run in arbitrary environments, which means that they can neither
    rely on native IPv6 for themselves, nor for their peers. The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism
    ensures that IPv6 can be assumed on all peers. This has a positive impact on the
    ability to initiate direct exchanges between such peers. The 6bed4 mechanism is
    meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6 connectivity on networks that do not support
    it natively, by running a tunnel over UDP and IPv4. The IPv4 address is used to
    support traceability of the traffic originator, which means that no user account
    or other configuration is needed. The tunnel mechanism encapsulates IPv6 in UDP/IPv4
    and builds on existing IPv6 discovery mechanisms; it employs Stateless Address
    Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address on a 6bed4 Peer, and Neighbor
    Discovery [RFC4861] to verify if a most direct route to a remote 6bed4 Peer is
    possible.</p>"
