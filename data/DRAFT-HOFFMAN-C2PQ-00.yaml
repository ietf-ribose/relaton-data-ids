abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum
    features\n   in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if large-\n
    \  scale quantum computers could be built, they could have a devastating\n   effect
    on classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and elliptic\n   curve signatures
    and key exchange, as well as on encryption\n   algorithms.  There has already
    been a great deal of study on how to\n   create algorithms that will resist large-scale
    quantum computers, but\n   so far, the properties of those algorithms make them
    onerous to adopt\n   before they are needed.\n\n   Small-scale quantum computers
    are being built today, but it is still\n   far from clear when large-scale quantum
    computers that can be used to\n   break classical algorithms with key sizes commonly
    used today will be\n   available.  It is important to be able to predict when
    large-scale\n   quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis will be possible so
    that\n   organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well\n
    \  before they are needed.\n\n   This document describes quantum computing, how
    it can be used to\n   attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly
    how to\n   predict when large-scale quantum computers will become feasible.\n\n\t
