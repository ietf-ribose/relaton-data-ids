abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses locator pair selection and failure detection\n
    \  mechanisms for the IPv6 multihoming feature being developed in the\n   Multi6
    working group.  Elements of this document may also be useful\n   for developing
    the details of the MOBIKE or HIP multihoming\n   mechanisms.  The draft also discusses
    the roles of a multihoming\n   protocol versus network attachment functions at
    IP and link layers.\n\t </p>\n      "
