abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes resource management issues that are relevant to
    the use of IP transport in cellular radio access networks (RANs). The document
    describes the particular characteristics of these kinds of networks, the requirements
    applicable to a resource reservation scheme in a cellular RAN, and provides a
    brief analysis of the applicability of existing solutions to this problem space.</p>"
