abstract:
- content: "<p>End-to-end encryption is an application of cryptography mechanisms
    and properties in communication systems between endpoints. End-to- end encrypted
    systems are exceptional in providing both security and privacy properties through
    confidentiality, integrity and authenticity features for users. Improvements to
    end-to-end encryption strive to maximise the user's security and privacy while
    balancing usability and availability. Users of end-to-end encrypted communications
    expect trustworthy providers of secure implementations to respect and protect
    them.</p>"
