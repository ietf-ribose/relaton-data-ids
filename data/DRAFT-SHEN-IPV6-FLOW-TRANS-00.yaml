abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interworking scheme.
    In\nthis scheme, the underlying mobility support mechanism is required to\nprovide
    a unique flow identity regardless of node mobility, making\nnode mobility transparent
    to flow QoS handling mechanisms. Thus QoS\nsignaling delay as well as data packet
    delays and losses during\nhandoff can be reduced. We also discuss solutions to
    achieve this\nscheme which utilizes the new IPv6 flow label. Finally, issues\nrelated
    to security and scalability will also be considered.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
