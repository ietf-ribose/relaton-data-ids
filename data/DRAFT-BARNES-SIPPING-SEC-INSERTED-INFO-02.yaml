abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses a standard mechanism for securing information
    in \n   SIP requests and responses, inserted by intermediaries, which may be \n
    \  used by other intermediaries or the endpoints as the basis for \n   services.
    The requirements are based on the need for a general \n   middle-to-middle and
    middle-to-end security mechanism applicable to \n   both headers and message bodies.
    \ This mechanism is optional, \n   however, the use of it enhances the overall
    security of SIP by \n   ensuring the integrity of the information inserted by
    an \n   intermediary.  \n\t </p>\n      "
