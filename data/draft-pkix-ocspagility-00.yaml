abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The OSCP specification defined in RFC 2560 requires server responsesto
    be signed but does not specify a mechanism for selecting thesignature algorithm
    to be used leading to possible interoperabilityfailures in contexts where multiple
    signature algorithms are in use.This document specifies an algorithm for server
    signature algorithmselection and an extension that allows a client to advise a
    serverthat specific signature algorithms are supported.</p>"
