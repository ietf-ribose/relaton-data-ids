abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a compact and fast hybrid signature scheme
    that \ncan be used to solve the problem of packet source authentication for \nmulticast.
    The scheme can be viewed as an improvement to \noff-line/on-line signature schemes,
    in that the signature size \noverhead is much smaller although still significant.
    This scheme\noffers several advantages over other schemes for multicast source\nauthentication.
    Firstly, the scheme provides the same security \nguarantees as regular public
    key signatures, but the signature \ncomputation is an order of magnitude faster.
    Secondly, this \nscheme permits each individual packet to be signed independently\nand
    efficiently, thus avoiding sender side latency found in schemes \nwhich need to
    spread a signature computation over several outgoing \npackets in order to achieve
    efficiency. This makes the scheme suitable\nin highly interactive settings where
    latency is an issue. This feature\nalso make the scheme useful in settings where
    several different  \nsignatures need to be computed for by a single server machine
    for \nseveral different, low rate flows. Thirdly, this is an off-line/on-line\nscheme
    where most of the computational load is in the off-line stage, \nthus the scheme
    is ideally suited to situations where the signer \nmachine has very irregular
    load. Finally, the scheme produces fixed \nsized authentication information (or
    signatures) so that applications \nknow a-priori the authentication overhead.\n\n\n\t
