abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS source routing mechanism developed by Source Packet
    Routing\n   in Networking (SPRING) WG can be leveraged to realize a unified\n
    \  source routing instruction which works across both IPv4 and IPv6\n   underlays
    in addition to the MPLS underlay.  The unified source\n   routing instruction
    can be used to realize a transport-independent\n   service function chaining by
    encoding the service function path\n   information or service function chain information
    as an MPLS label\n   stack.  This document describes how to advertise service
    functions\n   and their corresponding attributes (e.g., service function label)\n
    \  using IS-IS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
