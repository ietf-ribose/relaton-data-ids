abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents. This framework
    defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state. These procedures have
    a serious deficiency in that they do not allow state to persist over a subscription
    refresh, or between two consecutive polls. This inability to suppress notifications
    of state already known to the subscriber results in superfluous traffic in the
    network. This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber
    to condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed since the
    previous notification was received. When such a condition is true, either the
    body of an event notification or the entire notification message is suppressed.</p>"
