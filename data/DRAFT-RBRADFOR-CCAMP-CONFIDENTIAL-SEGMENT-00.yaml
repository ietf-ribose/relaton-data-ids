abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Routes for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched
    Paths \n(LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the
    \nLSP crosses multiple domains such as Autonomous Systems (ASs) the \npath may
    be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each \nresponsible for computing
    a segment of the path. \n \nHowever, in some cases such as when ASs are administered
    by separate \nService Providers, it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE
    to \nsupply a path segment to a PCE in another domain. This issue may be \ncircumvented
    by returning a loose hop and by invoking a new path \ncomputation from the domain
    boundary LSR during LSP setup as the LSP \nenters the second domain, but this
    technique has several issues \nincluding the problem of maintaining path diversity.
    \n \nThis document allows a PCE to provide a full path, but to hide the \ncontents
    of a segment of that path called the Confidential Path \nSegment (CPS). The CPS
    may be conveyed in the PCE Communication \nProtocol (PCEP) and signaled in a Resource
    Reservation Protocol \n(RSVP) explicit route either by replacing it with a path
    key or by \nencrypting it. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
