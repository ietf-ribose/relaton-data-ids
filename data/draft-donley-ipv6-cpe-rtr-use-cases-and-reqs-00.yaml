abstract:
  content: "<p>This document captures use cases and associated requirements for anIPv6
    Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router. Specifically, thecurrent version of
    this document focuses on the provisioning of anIPv6 CPE router and the provisioning
    of IPv6 Home Devices attached toit. It also addresses IPv6 traffic forwarding
    and IPv6 CPE Routersecurity. This document also identifies areas for futureconsideration.
    These areas include prefix sub-delegation, IPv6multicast, transition and tunneling
    mechanisms, provisioningconsistency between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, and DNS support.
    Thisdocument does not address IPv4 use cases or requirements, as they arewidely
    understood; however, it is expected that IPv6 CPE Routers willalso support IPv4.</p>"
