abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH
    which supports bi-directional message-based communication over byte- stream oriented
    protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics). The WiSH framing is designed
    to be compatible with WebSocket. You may want to think about WiSH as a binary
    and bi-directional alternative to the framing defined for the server-sent events
    [SSE].</p>"
