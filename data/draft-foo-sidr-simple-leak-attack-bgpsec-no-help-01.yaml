abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
    how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily circumvented
    in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP. It is meant to serve
    as input to the IETF's Secure Inter-Domain Routing working group during routing
    security requirements discussions and subsequent specification.</p>"
