abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The CAPWAP problem statement describes a problem that needs
    to be\n   addressed before a wireless LAN (WLAN) network designer can construct\n
    \  a solution composed of Wireless Termination Points (WTP) and Access\n   Controllers
    (AC) from multiple, different vendors.  One of the\n   primary goals is to find
    a solution that solves the interoperability\n   between the two classes of devices
    (WTPs and ACs) which then enables\n   an AC from one vendor to control and manage
    a WTP from another.  RNP\n   is a protocol that supports the management of WTP's
    Radio\n   information, Session Parameters, Data Forwarding and interaction with\n
    \  the Wireless Portal.  The RNP protocol consists of five sub-\n   protocols:
    RNP-DT (Data Tunneling), RNP-SM (Session Management),\n   RNP-RC (Radio Control),
    RNP-DF (Data Forwarding), and RNP-WP\n   (Wireless Portal).  The RTP protocol
    with it's family of protocol\n   provides a complete control situation for the
    CAPWAP environment.  In\n   many ways, RNP provides a super set of the RNP requiremetns.\n\t
