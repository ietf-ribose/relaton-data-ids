abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes technical concerns that should be considered\n
    \   in the design of standardized RDMA and DDP protocols/mechanisms for \n\n    use
    with Internet transport protocols.  This draft was written to\n    provide input
    to the proposed new Remote Direct Data Placement\n    (rddp) WG, and is not intended
    for publication as an RFC.\n    \n    This is an updated and resubmitted version
    of draft-ietf-rddp-rdma-\n    concerns-00.txt to make it available for current
    discussions of\n    mandatory-to-implement security in the RDDP WG.  Sections
    4.1, 4.2, \n\n    and 5 are of particular relevance to that discussion.\n\t </p>\n
