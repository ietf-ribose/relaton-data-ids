abstract:
- content: "<p>This document investigates the interworking between the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) and the benefits that may
    arise from their combined operation. The aspect of exchanging Host Identities
    (or Host Identity Tags) in SIP/SDP for later usage with the Host Identity Protocol
    Protocol (HIP) is described in more detail as an example of this interworking.</p>"
