abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  An exception to this requirement occurs when there is an\n   IPv6/IPv4
    protocol translator in the path, where in-the-network\n   fragmentation may be
    unavoidable when the IPv4 network path includes\n   a restricting link.  Unfortunately,
    recent investigations have shown\n   that IPv6 Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) interacts
    poorly with tunnels to\n   the point that tunneled packets can be best accommodated
    only when\n   the tunnel ingress is permitted to perform fragmentation.  This\n
    \  document therefore updates the IPv6 protocol specification to enable\n   in-the-network
    fragmentation by routers that configure tunnel\n   endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
