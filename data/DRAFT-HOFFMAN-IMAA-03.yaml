abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\nspecification
    describes how to process domain names that contain\ncharacters outside the ASCII
    repertoire.  A user who has a non-ASCII\ndomain name may want to use it in an
    Internet mail address that\ncontains non-ASCII characters not only in the domain
    part but also\nin the local part (the part to the left of the '@').  This document\ndescribes
    how to use non-ASCII characters in local parts.  It\ndefines internationalized
    local parts (ILPs), internationalized mail\naddresses (IMAs), and a mechanism
    called IMAA for handling them in a\nstandard fashion.\n\t </p>\n      "
