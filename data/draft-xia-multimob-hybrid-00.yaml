abstract:
  content: "\t <t>In MIPv6 specification, there are two basic methods for mobilemulticast:
    1) via a bi-directional tunnel from MN to its HomeAgent;2) via a local multicast
    router on the foreign link beingvisited. In this memo, a hybrid method is introduced.
    MN subscribesmulticast service through Home agent at first. Then, MN changes itssubscription
    router to a local multicast router which can provide thesame multicast service.</p>"
