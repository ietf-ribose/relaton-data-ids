abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number, and more particularly the number of different types,
    of devices connecting to the Internet increases, credential mobility becomes an
    issue for IETF standardization. This document responds to the requirements on
    protocols for secure exchange of credentials listed in RFC 3157, by presenting
    an abstract protocol framework. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
