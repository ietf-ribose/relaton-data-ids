abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which
    consists of a customized network topology and a set of network resource allocated
    from the physical network. In a network, multiple VTNs can be created to meet
    different service requirements, and services may be mapped to the same or different
    VTNs. In networks where BGP Shortest Path First (SPF) is used to distribute the
    link-state information among network nodes, the information of VTNs needs to be
    distributed along with the basic network information. This document specifies
    the BGP SPF mechanisms with necessary extensions to distribute the VTN information
    and perform VTN-specific path computaton.</p>"
