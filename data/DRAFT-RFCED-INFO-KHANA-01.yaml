abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The PPP protocol allows data transfer thru asynchronous or synchronous\nconnections.
    But the prevalent Public Switched Data Networks (PSDNs)\nsupport connections between
    asynchronous and synchronous protocols. \nThis document defines extensions to
    the PPP protocol to support asynchronous PAD to synchronous X.25 protocols on
    PSDNs.\n\t </p>\n      "
