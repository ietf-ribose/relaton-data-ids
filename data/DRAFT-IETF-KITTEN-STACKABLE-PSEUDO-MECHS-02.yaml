abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable
    pseudo-\nmechanisms, and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for the\nGeneric
    Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API),\nas well as several
    utility functions.\n\nStackable GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition
    of new\nmechanisms that combine features from multiple mechanisms.  Stackable\nmechanisms
    that add support for Perfect Forward Security (PFS), data\ncompression, additional
    authentication factors, etc... are\nfacilitated by this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
