abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of in-band telemetry is to drive per packet, per hop real-
    time monitoring for the infrastructure towards achieving a programmable proactive
    SLA monitoring framework. Some of the key aspects from a switch/NIC perspective
    are - ingress/egress timestamp (latency), queue depth, bandwidth etc. Some of
    the key aspects from a server perspective are - cache/memory statistics etc. This
    document summarizes the current work in the industry in this area and identifies
    key requirements for a comprehensive solution. Towards addressing the requirements,
    this document describes uses cases and defines reusable monitoring packet formats
    across all layers in the OAM hierarchy.</p>"
