abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies one method for autoconfiguration for the Optimized
    Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for stand-alone ad hoc networks. OLSR is a
    routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks, designed for use in multi-hop wireless
    ad hoc networks ; and as such it specifies how individual nodes can construct
    routes to each other. To achieve this, it relies on preliminary assignment of
    unique IP addresses to OLSR interfaces ; hence the task of generating addresses,
    checking their uniqueness and assigning them to interfaces is defined externally.
    This document proposes a complementary method, called "No Overhead Autoconfiguration
    for OLSR" (NOA-OLSR), to perform this task of ensuring uniqueness of addresses
    which have been generated. It also performs to ensure uniqueness of addresses
    which have been assigned and used when network merger occurs. This method consists
    of modifications in the OLSR specification.</p>
