abstract:
  content: <p>This document specifies one method for autoconfiguration for theOptimized
    Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for stand-alone ad hocnetworks. OLSR is a routing
    protocol for mobile ad hoc networks,designed for use in multi-hop wireless ad
    hoc networks ; and as suchit specifies how individual nodes can construct routes
    to each other.To achieve this, it relies on preliminary assignment of unique IPaddresses
    to OLSR interfaces ; hence the task of generatingaddresses, checking their uniqueness
    and assigning them to interfacesis defined externally. This document proposes
    a complementarymethod, called "No Overhead Autoconfiguration for OLSR" (NOA-OLSR),to
    perform this task of ensuring uniqueness of addresses which havebeen generated.
    It also performs to ensure uniqueness of addresseswhich have been assigned and
    used when network merger occurs. Thismethod consists of modifications in the OLSR
    specification.</p>
