abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is a product of the work of MIF architecture
    design\n   team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues,\n   experienced
    by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks.  The\n   framework defines
    the notion of a Provisioning Domain (PVD) - a\n   consistent set of network configuration
    information, and PVD-aware\n   nodes - nodes which learn PVDs from the attached
    network(s) and/or\n   other sources and manage and use multiple PVDs for connectivity\n
    \  separately and consistently.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
