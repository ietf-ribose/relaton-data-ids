abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo is a first step towards the design of RSVP Version 2.
    We \ntake RSVP Version 1 as a basis of this work. RSVP has been criticized \nmainly
    because of its complexity and poor scalability among others. \nWe present the
    first steps towards the definition of a new version of \nRSVP. The goal is to
    provide a more 'light' approach that can help \nimprove handling reservations
    in the network by means of a simplified \nbehavior. \nThis proposal for RSVP Version
    2 is not meant as a complete \nreplacement of RSVP Version 1 but is meant to coexist
    with Version 1. \nFor some scenarios such as receiver orientation and multicasting
    we \nassume that RSVP version 1 works fine. \n\t </p>\n      "
