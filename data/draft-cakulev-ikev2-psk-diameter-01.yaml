abstract:
  content: <p>Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for performingmutual
    authentication as well as establishing and maintainingsecurity associations (SAs)
    between two parties such as a user and anetwork entity. Internet Key Exchange
    v2 (IKEv2) protocol allowsseveral different mechanisms for authenticating a user,
    namely theExtensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-sharedsecrets.
    To authenticate and/or authorize the user, the networkelement such as the Access
    Gateway may need to dynamically bootstrapa security association based on interaction
    with the Diameter server.This document specifies the interaction between the Access
    Gatewayand Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared secrets.Status of
