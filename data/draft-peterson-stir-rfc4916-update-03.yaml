abstract:
- content: <p>The SIP Identity header conveys cryptographic identity information about
    the originators of SIP requests. The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR)
    framework however provides no means for determining the identity of the called
    party in a traditional telephone calling scenario. This document updates prior
    guidance on the "connected identity" problem to reflect the changes to SIP Identity
    that accompanied STIR, and considers a revised problem space for connected identity
    as a means of detecting calls that have been retargeted to a party impersonating
    the intended destination, as well as the spoofing of mid-dialog or dialog-terminating
    events by intermediaries or third parties.</p>
