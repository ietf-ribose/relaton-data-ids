abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Simultaneous authentication for multiple accounts is an attractive\n
    \  feature but is not supported in the current Internet Message Access\n   Protocol
    [RFC3501]. This document introduces an extension of the\n   Internet Message Access
    Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With\n   this extension, when a client is
    authenticated with one of its\n   account identifiers, it is also authenticated
    automatically with all\n   the other associated account identifiers (if present),
    i.e., a client\n   can be authenticated for all of its associated accounts at
    the same\n   time.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
