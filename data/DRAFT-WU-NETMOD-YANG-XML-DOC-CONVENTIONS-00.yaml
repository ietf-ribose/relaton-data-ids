abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many documents that define YANG modules also include examples\n
    \  presented in XML.\n\n   IETF documentation has specific limits on line length
    and some XML\n   examples have to include line wraps that would not normally be\n
    \  allowed according to the XML representation rules of RFC7950 and\n   RFC7952.\n\n
    \  This document lays out documentation conventions that allow YANG\n   examples
    to be presented in IETF documentation when leaf node\n   encoding would otherwise
    exceed the maximum line length.  There are\n   no implications in this document
    for YANG parsers: this document does\n   not change the rules for presenting YANG
    models or for encoding YANG\n   in data files or in the wire.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
