abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies MAP-E (together with MAP-T and 4rd)'s multicast
    component so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over
    an IPv6 network. In the encapsulation solution for encapsulation variant of Mapping
    of Address and Port (MAP), MAP-E, IGMP Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge router
    uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel established by MAP-E to exchange IGMP messages to establish
    multicast state at MAP-E Border Relay so that MAP-E Border Relay can tunnel IPv4
    multicast data to IPv4 hosts connected to MAP-E Customer Edge device. In the Translation
    Multicast solution for the translation variant of MAP, MAP-T and 4rd, IGMP messages
    are translated into MLD messages at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy and
    sent to the network in IPv6. MAP-T/4rd Border Relay does the reverse translation
    and joins IPv4 multicast group for MAP-T/4rd hosts. Border Relay as multicast
    router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates the packet into IPv6 multicast
    data and sends downstream on the multicast tree. Member CEs receive multicast
    data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.</p>"
