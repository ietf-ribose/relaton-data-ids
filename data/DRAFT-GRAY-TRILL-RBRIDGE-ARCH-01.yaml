abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols
    \nas a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the \nlink layer
    with network layer routing benefits. RBridges use \nexisting link state routing
    to provide higher RBridge to RBridge \ncross-section bandwidth, fast convergence
    on reconfiguration, \nand more robustness under link interruption than an equivalent
    \nset of conventional bridges using existing spanning tree \nforwarding. They
    are intended to apply to similar L2 network \nsizes as conventional bridges and
    are intended to be backward \ncompatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress
    and \ntransit. They also attempt to retain as much 'plug and play' as \nis already
    available in existing bridges. This document proposes \nan RBridge system as a
    solution to the TRILL problem. It also \ndefines the RBridge architecture, defines
    its terminology, and \ndescribes basic components and desired behavior. One or
    more \nseparate documents specify the protocols and mechanisms that \nsatisfy
    the architecture presented herein.\n\t </p>\n      "
