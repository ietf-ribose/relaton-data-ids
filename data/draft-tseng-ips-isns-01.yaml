  content: "\t <t>The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides a genericframework
    for configuring and managing various storage entities andtheir usage attributes
    in an IP-based storage network. iSNSintegrates Fibre Channel name server and DNS
    mechanisms into acommon naming and resource-discovery framework. The iSNS Protocol(iSNSP)
    defines how entities communicate with the iSNS server todiscover and utilize available
    networked storage resources. TheiSNS server MAY be supported by a consolidated
    iSNS directorydatabase, which serves as a repository to store information aboutvarious
    storage resources, providing easy access to topologyinformation for storage entities.</p>"
