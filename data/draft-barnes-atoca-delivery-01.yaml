abstract:
- content: "<p>Emergency alerts need to be delivered reliably from one source to many
    recipients at once. TCP is unsuitable for this style of delivery, because the
    large number of acknowledgements would likely cause network congestion. This document
    defines a UDP-based protocol for delivering alerts that supports fragmentation
    and retransmission for reliability, and allows the sender of a datagram to control
    whether acknowledgements are sent. Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org
    mailing list.</p>"
