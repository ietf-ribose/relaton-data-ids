abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As of this writing, the IMPP working group has largely reachedconsensus
    on the requirements for IMPP [Reqts]. In addition, Hudson[Issues] has catalogued
    a set of design issues discussed on themailing list.This document proposes a starting
    point for further discussions aboutthe design of the Instant Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (IMPP). Itis not a fully-specified protocol, but a summary of design
    decisionson which the authors were able to reach agreement during two full daysof
    discussion. Our discussions drew on knowledge of operational andarchitectural
    aspects of Activerse Ding!, Lotus Sametime, MicrosoftExchange instant messaging,
    MSN Messenger, and Zephyr, among otherdiverse, widely-deployed systems supporting
    presence and/or instantmessaging. We believe that the issues on which we reached
    agreementare issues on which the working group as a whole should be able toquickly
    reach rough consensus. We hope that the working group will beable to adopt these
    decisions as the basis for further work ondesigning IMPP; of course, we recognize
    the possibility that strongtechnical arguments not hitherto considered may cause
    the group toarrive at different decisions in some instances.We also identified
    some areas, primarily related to security, in whichwe were lacking enough information
    or experience to make a solidrecommendation. We draw the working group's attention
    to these issuesin the hope that others can contribute. Although we have treated
    presence and instant messaging in the samedocument, we believe that these design
    decisions allow implementors tooffer either service independently of the other.</p>"
