abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification describes a mechanism for sender-constraining\n
    \  OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the\n   application
    level.  This mechanism allows for the detection of replay\n   attacks with access
    tokens.\n\n   This specification compliments and builds upon the mechanisms defined\n
    \  in draft-fett-oauth-dpop, in which access tokens are returned from\n   the
    token endpoint.  In particular, this specification extends the\n   Demonstration
    of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)\n   mechanisms to also
    be usable with the OAuth 2.0 implicit flow, in\n   which access tokens are returned
    from the authorization endpoint.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
