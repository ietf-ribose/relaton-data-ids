abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard interdomain\n
    \  routing protocol in the Internet. Inside an Autonomous System (AS),\n   the
    interdomain routes are often distributed by using BGP Route\n   Reflectors (RR).
    Today, most RR are simple BGP routers. We show that\n   by adding intelligence
    to the RR, it is possible to improve both the\n   routing and the packet forwarding
    in ASes. We show how a versatile RR\n   can help an AS to engineer the flow of
    its incoming or outgoing\n   interdomain traffic. We also discuss how a versatile
    RR could help to\n   reduce the BGP convergence time or reduce the size of the
    routing\n   tables when  providing BGP/MPLS VPN services.\n\t </p>\n      "
