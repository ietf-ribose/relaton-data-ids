abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC3748,\n
    \  provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication\n   methods.
    \ EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and other TLS-based\n   EAP methods are
    widely deployed and used for network access\n   authentication.  Large certificates
    and long certificate chains\n   combined with authenticators that drop an EAP
    session after only 40 -\n   50 round-trips is a major deployment problem.  This
    document looks at\n   this problem in detail and describes the potential solutions\n
    \  available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
