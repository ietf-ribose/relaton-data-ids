abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting recordformat,
    the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME,ADIF is designed
    to compactly represent accounting data from anyprotocol using attribute/value
    pairs (AVPs) or variable bindings.ADIF may be used within accounting systems in
    several ways. In somecases, Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based
    on dataobtained from accounting protocols. It is also possible for devices tostore
    data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accountingserver, using an
    accounting or file transfer protocol. The latterapproach has the advantage of
    offloading the Accounting Server from thetask of transcribing interim or session
    records, thus improvingscalability. In either scenario, ADIF may be used to transfer
    a singleaccounting records, or a batch of accounting records.</p>"
