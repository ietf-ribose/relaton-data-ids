abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting record
    format, the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME, ADIF is
    designed to compactly represent accounting data from any protocol using attribute/value
    pairs (AVPs) or variable bindings. ADIF may be used within accounting systems
    in several ways. In some cases, Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based
    on data obtained from accounting protocols. It is also possible for devices to
    store data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accounting server,
    using an accounting or file transfer protocol. The latter approach has the advantage
    of offloading the Accounting Server from the task of transcribing interim or session
    records, thus improving scalability. In either scenario, ADIF may be used to transfer
    a single accounting records, or a batch of accounting records.</p>"
