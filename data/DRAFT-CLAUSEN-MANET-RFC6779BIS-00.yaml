abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document revises, extends, and replaces RFC 6779.  It
    defines a\n   portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network\n
    \  management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it\n   describes
    objects for configuring parameters of the Neighborhood\n   Discovery Protocol
    (NHDP) process on a router.  The MIB module\n   defined in this document, denoted
    NHDP-MIB, also reports state,\n   performance information, and notifications about
    NHDP.  This\n   additional state and performance information is useful to\n   troubleshoot
    problems and performance issues during neighbor\n   discovery.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
