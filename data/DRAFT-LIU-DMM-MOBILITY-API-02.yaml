abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to provide an appropriate level of mobility support
    that a\n   mobile node may require for proper performance of various\n   applications,
    it is important to enable applications to select\n   addresses that will be managed
    properly by the mobility management\n   infrastructure.  Previous documents have
    enabled address selection on\n   the basis of certain characteristics such as
    randomness, temporary\n   usage, scope of validity, and so on.  This document
    proposes new\n   classes of addresses in addition to those already available,
    to\n   enable an application to receive certain kinds of mobility support.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
