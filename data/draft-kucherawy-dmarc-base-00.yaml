abstract:
- content: "<p>The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through which
    email senders and receivers can make use of multiple authentication protocols
    in an attempt to establish reliable domain identifiers. This lack of cohesion
    prevents receivers from providing domain-specific feedback to senders regarding
    the accuracy of authentication deployments. Inaccurate authentication deployments
    preclude receivers from safely taking deterministic action against email that
    fails authentication checks. Finally, email senders do not have the ability to
    publish policies specifying actions that should be taken against email that fails
    multiple authentication checks. This memo presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism
    by which an organization can express, using the Domain Name System, domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting with
    predictable and accurate results. The enclosed proposal is not intended to introduce
    mechanisms that provide elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email. The
    proposal presents a mechanism for policy distribution that enables a continuum
    of increasingly strict handling of messages that fail multiple authentication
    checks, from no action, through silent reporting, up to message rejection.</p>"
