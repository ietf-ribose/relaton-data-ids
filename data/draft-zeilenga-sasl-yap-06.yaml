abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called
    YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ, for use in protocols which support Simple Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL) framework. The mechanism relies on security services
    provided by a lower layer, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), to protect
    the authentication exchange, and subsequent application data exchange, from common
    attacks. The YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ mechanism can be viewed as an alternative to
    other password-based SASL mechanism, such as PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.</p>"
