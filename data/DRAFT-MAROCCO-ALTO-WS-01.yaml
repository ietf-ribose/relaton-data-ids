abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is\n   designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure
    to export such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more
    endpoints to connect to among large sets of\n   logically equivalent ones.  The
    base protocol specification adopts a\n   simple pull-based model, according to
    which the client retrieves the\n   information encoded as JSON objects over HTTP
    directly from the\n   server.\n\n   This document proposes (for discussion) a
    mechanism for providing\n   server-initiated information update notifications
    through a\n   WebSocket-based ALTO protocol extension that easily integrates in
    the\n   basic protocol model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
