abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY\n
    \  that indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data\n   across
    a label.  That is, every label (dot) underneath is considered\n   a zone cut and
    must have its own (signed) delegation.  Additionally,\n   it indicates the zone
    is expecting its parent to never bypass or\n   override the zone.  DNSSEC Validating
    Resolvers can use this flag to\n   mark any data that violates the DELEGATION_ONLY
    policy as BOGUS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
