abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2
    is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector. Since
    the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007, security and efficiency have
    been rigorously evaluated through academic and industrial studies. As of the publication
    of this document, no security vulnerabilities have been found. KCipher-2 offers
    fast encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable efficient
    implementation. KCipher-2 has been used for industrial applications, especially
    for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.</p>"
