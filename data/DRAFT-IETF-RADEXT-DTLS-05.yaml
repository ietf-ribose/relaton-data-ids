abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication\n
    \  and encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data \"in\n   the
    clear\", although some parts of the packets can have \"obfuscated\"\n   content.
    \ Packets may be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and\n   client-server authentication
    is based on fixed shared secrets.  This\n   document specifies how the Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\n   protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.
    \ It also describes\n   how implementations of this proposal can co-exist with
    current RADIUS\n   systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
