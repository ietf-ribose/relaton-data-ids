abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an alternative of the control plane
    and data\n   plane procedures that allow segmented MVPN using the more efficient\n
    \  LIR-pF explicit-tracking when BIER is used as the upstream or\n   downstream
    or both segments.  It requires a segmentation point BFR\n   doing an IP header
    lookup, which is common for the forwarding\n   procedure on BFER, or the forwarding
    procedure on ABR with local VPN\n   CEs connected.  This document updates [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].\n\n\n\t
