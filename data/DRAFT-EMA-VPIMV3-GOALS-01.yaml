abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the goals of Voice Profile for Internet
    Mail \n(VPIM), Version 3 and establishes a baseline of desired \nfunctionality
    against which proposed MIME profiles for Internet \nvoice messaging can be judged.
    The primary goal for this version is \nto support interoperability with desktop
    clients. Other goals for \nthis version of VPIM include backward compatibility,
    expanded \ninteroperability with unified messaging systems, and conformance to
    \nInternet standards. This document does not include goals that were \nmet fully
    by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2]. \nDifferent levels of desirability are indicated throughout
    the \ndocument. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
