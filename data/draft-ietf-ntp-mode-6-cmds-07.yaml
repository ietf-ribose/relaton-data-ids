abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the structure of the control messages that
    were historically used with the Network Time Protocol before the advent of more
    modern control and management approaches. These control messages have been used
    to monitor and control the Network Time Protocol application running on any IP
    network attached computer. The information in this document was originally described
    in Appendix B of RFC 1305. The goal of this document is to provide a current,
    but historic, description of the control messages as described in RFC 1305 and
    any additional commands implemented in NTP. The publication of this document is
    not meant to encourage the developement and deployment of these control messages.
    This document is only providing a current reference for these control messages
    given the current status of RFC 1305.</p>"
