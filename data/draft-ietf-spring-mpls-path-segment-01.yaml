abstract:
- content: "<p>A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment list. Only
    the full segment list identifies the full end-to-end path, and one segment or
    a partial set of segments from the list cannot identify the SR path and distinguish
    it from other SR paths that may be partially congruent. But path identification
    is a pre-requisite for various use-cases such as performance measurement (PM)
    of an SR path. In SR for MPLS (SR-MPLS) the segment identifiers are stripped from
    the packet through label popping as the packet transits the network. This means
    that when a packet reaches the egress of the SR path, it is not possible to determine
    on which SR path it traversed the network. This document defines a new type of
    segment that is referred to as Path Segment, which is used to identify an SR path
    in an SR-MPLS network. When used, it is inserted at the ingress node of the SR
    path and immediately follows the last segment identifier in the segment list of
    the SR path. The Path Segment will not be popped off until it reaches the egress
    node of the SR path. A Path Segment can be used by the egress node to implement
    path identification hence to support various use-cases including SR path PM, end-to-end
    1+1 SR path protection, and bidirectional SR paths correlation.</p>"
