- content: "<p>This document defines the Origin attribute for cookies, which lets
    servers harmonize the security policy of their cookies with the widely used same-origin
    policy. Origin cookies provide both confidentiality and integrity, unlike the
    Secure attribute, which provides only confidentiality.Editorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor) If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send
    email to &lt;mailto:http-state@ietf.org&gt;. Further Working Group information
