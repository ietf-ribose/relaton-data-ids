abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Multi-addresses/Multi-path TCP (MPTCP for short) describes theextensions
    proposed for TCP so that each endpoint of a given TCPconnection can use multiple
    IP addresses to exchange data (instead ofa single IP address per endpoint as currently
    defined). Suchextensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination
    address pairs, resulting in the capability of usingmultiple paths in a significant
    number of scenarios. In particular,some level of multihoming and mobility support
    can be achievedthrough these extensions. However, the support for multiple IPaddresses
    per endpoint may have implications on the security of theresulting MPTCP protocol.
    This note includes a threat analysis forMPTCP.</p>"
