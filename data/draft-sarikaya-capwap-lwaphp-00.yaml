abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Light Weight Access Point Handover Protocol
    (LWAPHP) which is a protocol allowing the access router to anchor and manage 802.11
    handovers of the stations between a collection of wireless Access Points. The
    protocol like IEEE's IAPP aims to ensure that a station is connected to a single
    access point and provides an efficient context transfer mechanism during handover
    using neighbor graphs.</p>"
