abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an initial proposal for a framework for
    using\n   forward error correction (FEC) codes with applications in the\n   Internet
    to provide protection against packet loss.  The framework\n   supports applying
    Forward Error Correction to arbitrary packet flows\n   and is primarily intended
    for streaming media.  This framework can be\n   used to define Content Delivery
    Protocols that provide Forward Error\n   Correction for streaming media delivery
    or other packet flows.\n   Content Delivery Protocols defined using this framework
    can support\n   any FEC Scheme (and associated FEC codes) which is compliant with\n
    \  various requirements defined in this document.  Thus, Content\n   Delivery
    Protocols can be defined which are not specific to a\n   particular FEC Scheme
    and FEC Schemes can be defined which are not\n   specific to a particular Content
    Delivery Protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
