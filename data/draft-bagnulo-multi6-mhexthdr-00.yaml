abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes an IPv6 multi-homing solution that achieves equivalent
    fault tolerance benefits to those provided by current IPv4 multi-homing solution
    while preserving the route aggregation capabilities of the Provider-based Aggregation
    scheme. The solution lies on the inclusion, in every packet flowing to a multi-homed
    site, of an extension header containing multiple alternative route information
    to the destination, so that if the original destination address becomes unreachable,
    alternative route is used for reaching the destination.</p>"
