abstract:
  content: "<p>This note describes an IPv6 multi-homing solution that achievesequivalent
    fault tolerance benefits to those provided by current IPv4multi-homing solution
    while preserving the route aggregationcapabilities of the Provider-based Aggregation
    scheme. The solutionlies on the inclusion, in every packet flowing to a multi-homed
    site,of an extension header containing multiple alternative routeinformation to
    the destination, so that if the original destinationaddress becomes unreachable,
    alternative route is used for reachingthe destination.</p>"
