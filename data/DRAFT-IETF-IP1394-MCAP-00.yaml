abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This docuent specifies how IP-capable Serial Bus devices may allocate\n
    \     IEEE 1394 channel nuber(s) for use in the multicast transmission of IP\n
    \     datagras. It defines the necessary methods, data structures and codes\n
    \     for that purpose.\n \n      See also the ost recent revision of draft-ietf-ip1394-ipv4
    for a\n      specification of the transport of IPv4 datagras over IEEE 1394.\n
    \n      CAUTION: This is a WORKING DOCUMENT of the IETF IP/1394 group; soe\n      parts
    reflect rough consensus achieved at the 41st IETF eeting in Los\n      Angeles,
    other parts reflect the editor's distillation of coments on\n      the reflector
    since then and still other parts are new contributions to\n      the evolution
    of MCAP. Until subsequent revisions of this docuent are\n      posted that ore
    clearly identify agreed areas, the reader should\n      consider this a work in
    progress very uch subject to revision. This\n      docuent is not yet adopted
    by the IP/1394 working group.\n\t </p>\n      "
