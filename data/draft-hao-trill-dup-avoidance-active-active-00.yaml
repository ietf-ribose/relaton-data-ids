abstract:
- content: "<p>The problems in active-active connection to TRILL campus was introduced
    in [TRILL-Active-PS]. Frame duplication was a well recognized issue in that scenario.
    This draft proposes a Designated Forwarder (DF) mechanism to solve the issue of
    frame duplications. The basic idea is to elect one RBridge per VLAN from an edge
    group to be responsible for egressing the multicast frames. An edge group is a
    group of edge RBridges that a CE is multi-homed to in active- active mode. TRILL
    protocol extension for DF election is described in this draft.</p>"
