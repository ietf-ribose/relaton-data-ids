abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-\n
    \  level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information\n   systems.
    \ This document describes the overall architecture of HTTP,\n   establishes common
    terminology, and defines aspects of the protocol\n   that are shared by all versions.
    \ In this definition are core\n   protocol elements, extensibility mechanisms,
    and the \"http\" and\n   \"https\" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC 3864 and obsoletes RFC 2818, RFC 7231, RFC\n   7232,
    RFC 7233, RFC 7235, RFC 7538, RFC 7615, RFC 7694, and portions\n   of RFC 7230.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
