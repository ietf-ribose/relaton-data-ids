abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Real Time Communications (RTC) tools are becoming as prevalent
    and\nessential for users on the Internet as email.  While RTC tools can,\nlike
    email, be implemented directly by users in a point-to-point\nfashion, they are
    often provided for or on behalf of a community of\nusers within an administrative
    domain.  As the use of these tools\ngrows, users increasingly have the need to
    communicate with users not\nonly within their own community but with those in
    other communities\nas well.  In practice, each community is controlled by some\nauthority,
    and so there is a need to provide for easier establishment\nof connectivity between
    communities, and the management of the inter-\ncommunity link.  This document
    contains an initial list of\nrequirements for provisioning and managing connectivity
    between\ncommunities.\n\t </p>\n      "
