abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
    time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term and long-term
    reception statistics. The available reporting may include aggregate information
    across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting. This document
    specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets discarded from
    the jitter buffer after successful reception.</p>"
