abstract:
  content: "<p>OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet. It
    isa complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks. While it isa powerful
    mechanism, it does not handle all situations, and itsappropriate use may not be
    obvious to beginners. Standards track documentsdeal with protocol design, but
    deployment of OSPF in many enterprisenetworks has been limited by lack of information
    on best current practiceinformation for interior routing. Best Current Practices
    documents havefocused on general exterior connectivity. This memorandum is intended
    tocomplement the protocol specification by describing the experience-based,vendor-independent
    techniques of OSPF and complementary technologies inrepresentative networks. Better
    understanding of the use of OSPF featuresto help exterior connectivity will help
    reduce the demand for complex userBGP configuration.</p>"
