abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the mechanism of Balia, the \"Balanced
    linked\n   adaptation\", which is a congestion control algorithm for Multipath\n
    \  TCP (MPTCP).  The recent proposals, LIA and OLIA, suffer from either\n   unfriendliness
    to Single Path TCP (SPTCP) or unresponsiveness to\n   network changes under certain
    conditions.  The tradeoff between\n   friendliness and responsiveness is inevitable,
    but Balia judiciously\n   balances this tradeoff based on a new design framework
    that allows\n   one to systematically explore the design space.  Balia has been\n
    \  implemented in the Linux kernel and also included in the UCLouvain's\n   MPTCP
    implementation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
