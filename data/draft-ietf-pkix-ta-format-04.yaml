abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a structure for representing trust anchor information.
    A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented by a public key and associated
    data. The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the associated
    data is used to constrain the types of information or actions for which the trust
    anchor is authoritative. The structures defined in this document are intended
    to satisfy the format-related requirements defined in Trust Anchor Management
    Requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
