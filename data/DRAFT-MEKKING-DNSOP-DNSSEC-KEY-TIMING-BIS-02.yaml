  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes issues surrounding the timing of events\n
    \  related to DNSSEC policy.  It presents timelines for various key\n   rollovers
    and DNSSEC policy changes regarding the key signing scheme.\n   It explicitly
    identifies the relationships between the various\n   parameters affecting the
    rollover process.\n\n   This document updates [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing]
    [MM: If\n   approved] as it covers timelines for key rollovers in more detail
    and\n   it covers additional key rollover scenarios, including algorithm\n   rollover
    and single type key rollovers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
