abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a method for transporting PTP messages
    over\n   an MPLS network supported by an Ethernet physical layer. The MPLS\n   layer
    itself is not used to carry the PTP messages with this method;\n   instead, a
    link local Ethernet channel is used. Several advantages\n   related to this method
    are highlighted in this document. The method\n   targets in particular telecom
    applications requiring accurate\n   phase/time synchronization, with \"link-by-link\"
    PTP architectures,\n   where all the network nodes support a PTP function, such
    as Boundary\n   Clock or Transparent Clock.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
