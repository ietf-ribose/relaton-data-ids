abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a routing architecture that is most applicable
    to\nCustomer Edge (CE)-based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nIn this architecture,
    customer devices use BGP to exchange VPN routes\nwith one another. The BGP UPDATES
    include a new attribute that\nidentifies the endpoint of a tunnel that can be
    used to reach a\nparticular VPN prefix.  The encapsulation strategy described
    in this\nmemo is more flexible than that described in RFC 4364. In this\narchitecture,
    the edge router can encapsulate the original datagram\ntwice, as in RFC 4364.
    In this case, the inner header provides VPN\ncontext and the outer header identifies
    the tunnel between edge\nrouters. Alternatively, the edge router can encapsulate
    the original\ndatagram only once, with the tunnel providing both VPN context and\nidentifying
    a tunnel to the remote edge router.Contents\n\t </p>\n      "
