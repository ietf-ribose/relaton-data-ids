abstract:
- content: "<p>The syslog protocol describes a number of service options related to
    propagating event messages. This memo describes a mapping of the syslog protocol
    to TCP connections, useful for reliable delivery of event messages through the
    use of a BEEP profile. The earlier RAW and COOKED BEEP syslog profiles are deprecated.
    The use of syslog over BEEP provides robustness and security in message delivery
    that is unavailable to the usual UDP-based syslog protocol, by providing encryption
    and authentication over a connection-oriented protocol.</p>"
