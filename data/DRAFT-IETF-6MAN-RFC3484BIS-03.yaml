abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two algorithms, for source address
    selection\n   and for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify\n
    \  default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)\n   implementations.
    \ They do not override choices made by applications\n   or upper-layer protocols,
    nor do they preclude the development of\n   more advanced mechanisms for address
    selection.  The two algorithms\n   share a common context, including an optional
    mechanism for allowing\n   administrators to provide policy that can override
    the default\n   behavior.  In dual stack implementations, the destination address\n
    \  selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -\n   depending
    on the available source addresses, the algorithm might\n   prefer IPv6 addresses
    over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa.\n\n   All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts
    and routers, must implement\n   default address selection as defined in this specification.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
