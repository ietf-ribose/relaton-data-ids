abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Benchmarking Methodologies defined in RFC2544 [1] are IP
    version\n   independent however, they do not address some of the specificities
    of\n   IPv6.  This document provides additional benchmarking guidelines\n   which
    in conjunction with RFC2544 will lead to a more complete and\n   realistic evaluation
    of the IPv6 performance of network elements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
