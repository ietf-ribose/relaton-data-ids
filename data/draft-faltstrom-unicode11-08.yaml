abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.3.0 and Unicode
    11.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008. Some additions and changes have been made in
    the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by the algorithm IDNA2008
    specifies. Although IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward
    compatibility; however, this document does not add any such exceptions. This document
    provides the necessary tables to IANA to make its database consisstent with Unicode
    11.0.0. To improve understanding, this document describes systems that are being
    used as alternatives to those that conform to IDNA2008. TO BE REMOVED AT TIME
    OF PUBLICATION AS AN RFC: This document is discussed on the i18nrp@ietf.org mailing
    list of the IETF.</p>"
