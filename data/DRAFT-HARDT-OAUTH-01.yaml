abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The OAuth Web Resource Authorization Profiles (OAuth WRAP) allow
    a\nserver hosting a Protected Resource to delegate authorization to one\nor more
    authorities.  An application (Client) accesses the Protected\nResource by presenting
    a short lived, opaque, bearer token (Access\nToken) obtained from an authority
    (Authorization Server).  There are\nProfiles for how a Client may obtain an Access
    Token when acting\nautonomously or on behalf of a User.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis
