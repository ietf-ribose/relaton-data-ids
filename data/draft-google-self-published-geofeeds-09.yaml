abstract:
- content: <p>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
    a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially
    termed a "geolocation feed". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds
    to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. This format
    intentionally only allows specifying coarse-level location. Some technical organizations
    operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already
    experimentally published small geolocation feeds. This document describes a currently
    deployed format. At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into
    a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to
    inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.</p>
