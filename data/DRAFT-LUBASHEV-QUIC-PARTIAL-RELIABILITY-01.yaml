abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces a MIN_STREAM_DATA frame to enable partial\n
    \  reliability for QUIC streams.  The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame allows a\n   sender
    to give up on retransmitting older parts of a stream and to\n   notify the receiver
    about this decision.  The content of this draft\n   is intended for merging into
    QUIC transport, recovery, and\n   applicability drafts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
