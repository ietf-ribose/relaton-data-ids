abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows clients
    to\n   \"observe\" resources at a server, and receive notifications as unicast\n
    \  responses upon changes of the resource state.  In some use cases,\n   such
    as based on publish-subscribe, it would be convenient for the\n   server to send
    a single notification addressed to all the clients\n   observing a same target
    resource.  This document updates RFC7252 and\n   RFC7641, and defines how a server
    sends observe notifications as\n   response messages over multicast, synchronizing
    all the observers of\n   a same resource on a same shared Token value.  Besides,
    this document\n   defines how Group OSCORE can be used to protect multicast\n
    \  notifications end-to-end between the server and the observer clients.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
