abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] describes a protocol
    for modems to advertise the status of wireless links between reachable destinations
    to attached routers. The core specification of the protocol assumes that every
    modem in the radio network has an attached DLEP router, and requires that the
    MAC address of the DLEP interface on the attached router be used to identify the
    destination in the network, for purposes of reporting the state and quality of
    the link to that destination. This document describes a DLEP Extension allowing
    modems that do not meet the strict requirement above to use DLEP to describe link
    availability and quality to one or more destinations reachable beyond a device
    on the Layer 2 domain.</p>"
