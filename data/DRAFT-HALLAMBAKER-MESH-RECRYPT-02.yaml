abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   independent\n\n   A messaging infrastructure providing full
    end-to end security is\n   presented.  Unlike existing approaches such as S/MIME
    and OpenPGP,\n   Mesh/Recrypt uses proxy re-encryption to preserve full end-to-end\n
    \  security with individual user and device keys in situations such as\n   the
    user having multiple decryption devices and messages being set to\n   mailing
    lists.\n\n   This document shows the use of Mesh/Recrypt to address the principle\n
    \  use cases Mesh/Recrypt is designed to address.  These include\n   asynchronous
    messaging such as mail and controlled documents and\n   synchronous messaging
    applications such as chat, voice and video.\n\n   This document is also available
    online at\n   http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-recrypt.html
