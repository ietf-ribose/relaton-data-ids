abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size
    overheads\n   when using different security protocols to secure CoAP.  The analyzed\n
    \  security protocols are DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and\n   OSCORE.
    \ DTLS and TLS are analyzed with and without compression.\n   DTLS are analyzed
    with two different alternatives for header\n   compression as well as with and
    without Connection ID.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
