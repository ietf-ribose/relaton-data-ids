abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The purpose of the TN3287 protocol is to provide a general, bi-directional
    printer communications facility.  It's primary goal is to allow a standard method
    of interfacing printer devices and printer-oriented processes to each other.  This
    protocol will allow a TN3270 Client to process 3287 print data streams.                                                        This
    RFC supplements and extends the RFC 854, TELNET Protocol Specification.  This
    RFC also presents an example of the correct implementation.\n\t </p>\n      "
