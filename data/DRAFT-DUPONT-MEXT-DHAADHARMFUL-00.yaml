abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) mechanism is\ndescribed
    in the Mobile IPv6 specification.  This mechanism is\nmandatory in any compliant
    Mobile IPv6 implementation and so in any\nMIPv6 based protocols too.  On the other
    hand, DHAAD was the only one\nmechanism to discover a potential Home Agent for
    a Mobile Node in the\npast.  This is no longer the case today.  This document
    analyzes the\nsecurity of the different existing home agent discovery mechanisms\nand
    promotes the remove of DHAAD from the future Mobile IPv6\nstandard, in light of
    this security analysis.\n\t </p>\n      "
