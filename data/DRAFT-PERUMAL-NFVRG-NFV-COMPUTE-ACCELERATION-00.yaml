abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network functions are being virtualized and moved to industry\n
    \  standard servers. Steady growth of traffic volume requires more\n   compute
    power to process the network functions. Network packet based\n   architecture
    provides a lot of scope for parallel processing. Generic\n   parallel processing
    can be done in common multicore platforms like\n   GPUs, coprocessors like Intel
    Xeon Phi[6][7] and Intel[7]/AMD[10]\n   multicore CPUs. In this draft to check
    the feasibility and to exploit\n   this parallel processing capability, multi
    string matching is taken\n   as the sample network function for URL filtering.
    Aho-Corasick\n   algorithm has been made use for multi pattern matching.\n   Implementation
    utilizes OpenCL [3] to support many common\n   platforms[7][10][11]. A list of
    optimizations is done, the\n   application is tested on Nvidia Tesla K10 GPUs.
    A common API for NFV\n   Compute Acceleration has been proposed.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
