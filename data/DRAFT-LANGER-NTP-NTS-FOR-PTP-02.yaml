abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a key management service for automatic
    key\n   management for the integrated security mechanism (prong A) of IEEE\n   Std
    1588[TM]-2019 (PTPv2.1) described there in Annex P.  It\n   implements a key management
    for the immediate security processing\n   approach and offers a security solution
    for all relevant PTP modes.\n   The key management service for PTP is based on
    and extends the NTS\n   Key Establishment protocol defined in IETF RFC 8915 for
    securing NTP,\n   but works completely independent from NTP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
