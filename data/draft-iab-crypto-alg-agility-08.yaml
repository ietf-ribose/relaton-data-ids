abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality,
    integrity, authentication, or digital signature. Communicating peers must support
    a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.
    This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate
    from one mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another over time.</p>"
