abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  Internet Draft is one of a pair written at the  request
    of one\nof the SPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion\non
    what extended functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide; the\nPINT work has
    similar requirements for a definition of the building\nblocks that might be used
    in future services (and so need to be\nsupported by the protocol). This note provides
    the 'mirror image' of\nthe associated SPIRITS draft, listing functional building
    blocks that\nmay be executed in response to future PINT protocol requests.\n\n\n\t
