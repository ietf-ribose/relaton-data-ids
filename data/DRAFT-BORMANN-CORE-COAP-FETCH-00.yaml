abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Similar to HTTP, the existing Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP)\n   GET method only allows the specification of a URI and request\n   parameters
    in CoAP options, not the transfer of a request payload\n   detailing the request.
    \ This leads to some applications to using POST\n   where actually a cacheable,
    idempotent, safe request is desired.\n\n   The present proposal adds a new CoAP
    method, FETCH, to perform the\n   equivalent of a GET with a request body.\n\n
    \  This specification is inspired by I-D.snell-search-method, which\n   updates
    the definition and semantics of the HTTP SEARCH request\n   method previously
    defined by RFC5323.  However, there is no intention\n   to limit FETCH to search-type
    operations, and the resulting\n   properties may not be the same as those of HTTP
    SEARCH.  For now, we\n   therefore prefer to discuss the proposal under a different
    name, for\n   which we have chosen the GET synonym FETCH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
