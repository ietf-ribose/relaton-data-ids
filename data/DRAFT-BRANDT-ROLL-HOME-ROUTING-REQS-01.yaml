abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document presents home control and automation application
    \n   specific requirements for ROuting in Low power and Lossy networks \n   (ROLL).
    In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used \n   for a wide set
    of purposes. Examples include lighting control, \n   heating control, sensors,
    leak detectors, healthcare systems and \n   advanced remote controls. Because
    such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often required.
    The aim of this \n   document is to specify the routing requirements for networks
    \n   comprising such constrained devices in a home network environment.\n\t </p>\n
