abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines an architecture, and related protocols, for performing
    dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration relying on a AAA infrastructure.
    The necessary interaction between the AAA server of the home provider and the
    mobile node is realized using EAP, exploiting the capability of some EAP methods
    to convey generic information items together with authentication data. This approach
    has the advantage that the access equipment acts as a simple pass-through for
    EAP messages and therefore does not play any active role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation
    procedure, which makes the solution easier to deploy and maintain.</p>"
