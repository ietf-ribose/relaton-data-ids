abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tools are
    essential\n   for a deterministic network.  The DetNet architecture [RFC8655]
    has\n   defined two sub-layers: (1) DetNet service sub-layer and (2) DetNet\n
    \  forwarding sub-layer.  OAM mechanisms exist for the DetNet forwarding\n   sub-layer.
    \ Nonetheless, OAM for the service sub-layer might require\n   new extensions
    to the existing OAM protocols.  This draft presents an\n   analysis of OAM procedures
    for the DetNet service sub-layer\n   functions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
