abstract:
- content: "<p>There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained
    environments that do not require confidentiality, though mutual authentication
    during tunnel establishment and message integrity is still mandated. This document
    defines the use of HMAC only cipher suites for TLS 1.3.</p>"
