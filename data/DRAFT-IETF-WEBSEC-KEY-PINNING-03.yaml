abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing
    web\n   host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember (\"pin\") the\n
    \  hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period of time.  During\n   that
    time, UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain\n   including
    at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose\n   fingerprint matches one
    or more of the pinned fingerprints for that\n   host.  By effectively reducing
    the scope of authorities who can\n   authenticate the domain during the lifetime
    of the pin, pinning may\n   reduce the incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks
    due to compromised\n   Certification Authorities and other authentication errors
    and\n   attacks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
