abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] introduces a new type of segment,\n
    \  Tunnel Segment, for the segment routing.  Tunnel segment can be used\n   to
    reduce SID stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or\n   provide differentiated
    services.  A binding label can be assigned to\n   tunnel segment.  An upstream
    node can use such a binding label for\n   steering traffic into the appropriate
    tunnel.  This document\n   specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support that
    PCC reports\n   binding label of tunnel to PCE and that PCE allocates label for\n
    \  tunnel and updates label binding of tunnel to PCC.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
