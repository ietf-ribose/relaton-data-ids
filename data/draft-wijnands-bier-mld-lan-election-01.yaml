abstract:
- content: "<p>When a host is connected to multiple multicast capable routers, each
    of these routers is a candidate to process the multicast flow for that LAN, but
    only one router should be elected to process it. This document proposes a generic
    multicast router election mechanism using Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
    and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) that can be used by any Multicast Overlay
    Signalling Protocol (MOSP). Having such generic election mechanism removes a dependency
    on Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM).</p>"
