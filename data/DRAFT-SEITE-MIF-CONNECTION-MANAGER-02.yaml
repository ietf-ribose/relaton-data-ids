abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is a common practice for multiple interface terminals to use
    a\nconnection manager to perform provisioning domain selection and\ninterface
    configuration.  The concept of connection managers for\npersonal computers is
    well known, and similar logic is now common in\nmobile phones that have multiple
    radio interfaces [3GPP TS 23.402].\nThe Problem Statement document highlights
    the lack of standardized\nbehavior for terminals in regard to managing multiple
    interfaces and\ntheir respective properties.  To address this issue, this document\nproposes
    a set of functional requirements for a generic MIF\nConnection Manager.\n\t </p>\n
