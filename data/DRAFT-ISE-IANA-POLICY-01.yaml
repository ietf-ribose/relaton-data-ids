abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries\n
    \  to track codepoints used by protocols such as those defined by the\n   IETF
    and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream.\n\n   The Independent Submissions
    Stream is another source of documents\n   that can be published as RFCs.  This
    stream is under the care of the\n   Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).\n\n
    \  This document complements RFC 4846 by providing a description of how\n   the
    ISE currently handles documents in the Independent Submissions\n   Stream that
    request actions from the IANA.  Nothing in this document\n   changes existing
    IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor\n   does it change any previously
    documented processes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
