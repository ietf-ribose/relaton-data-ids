abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Service Providers commonly use BGP/MPLS VPNs [RFC 4364] as
    the control plane for virtual networks. This technology has proven to scale to
    a large number of VPNs and attachment points, and it is well suited for Data Center
    connectivity, especially when supporting all IP applications. The Data Center
    environment presents new challenges and imposes additional requirements to IP
    VPN technologies, including multi- tenancy support, high scalability, VM mobility,
    security, and orchestration. This document describes the problems and defines
    the new requirements.</p>"
