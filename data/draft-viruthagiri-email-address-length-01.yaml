abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines an SMTP extension with keyword "EAML" whereby an SMTP
    server can declare that it is capable of handling longer email addresses without
    any local-part or domain-part restriction set by RFC 5321. EAML stands for "Email
    Address Maximum Length".</p>
