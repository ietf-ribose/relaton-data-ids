abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the case of BGP AFIs such as IPv6 unicast or VPNv4 unicast,
    it is\n   possible for the data traffic intended for the NLRIs of that\n   AFI/SAFI,
    to be forwarded over an underlying tunnel. The tunnel may\n   be to a PE or to
    a Tunnel Concentrator or a Tunnel Broker. Both will\n   be referred to as Tunnel
    endpoints. In this document an egress router\n   refers to the egress point of
    the Tunnel and an ingress router refers\n   to the ingress point of the tunnel.\n\n
    \  The discovery of the Tunnel endpoint and the corresponding tunnel\n   encapsulation
    information may be done out of band, either by static\n   configuration, or through
    a number of different mechanisms.\n\n   There is a need to be able to indicate
    with the BGP update for a\n   given NLRI, the Tunnel endpoint to be used for forwarding
    data\n   traffic to that NLRI destination.\n\n   This document defines a new BGP
    attribute called the 'Connector\n   Attribute' which would convey the information
    about the Tunnel\n   endpoint - the Tunnel Identifier, the Tunnel endpoint address.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
