abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies an experimental Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
    option\n   that is meant to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can
    be\n   established and maintained for a given MPTCP connection.  The purpose\n
    \  is to minimize any possible performance degradation that can be\n   induced
    by a possibly large number of establishment requests for\n   additional subflows
    if the remote endpoint is not appropriately\n   dimensioned to handle such requests.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
