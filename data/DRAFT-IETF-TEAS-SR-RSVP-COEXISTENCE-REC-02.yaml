abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing
    (SR)\n   LSPs in networks running Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP-TE)\n   LSPs.
    \ In some instances, operators are also migrating existing\n   services from RSVP-TE
    to SR LSPs.  For example, there might be\n   certain services that are well suited
    for SR and need to co-exist\n   with RSVP-TE in the same network.  In other cases,
    services running\n   on RSVP-TE might be migrated to run over SR.  Such introduction
    or\n   migration of traffic to SR might require co-existence with RSVP-TE in\n
    \  the same network for an extended period of time depending on the\n   operator's
    intent.  The following document provides solution options\n   for keeping the
    traffic engineering database (TED) consistent across\n   the network, accounting
    for the different bandwidth utilization\n   between SR and RSVP-TE.\n\n\t </p>\n
