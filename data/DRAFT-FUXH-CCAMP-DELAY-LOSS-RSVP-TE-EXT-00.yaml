abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The key driver for latency is stock/commodity trading applications.\n
    \  Financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to-end private\n   pipe
    line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms.  Latency\n   and latency
    SLA is one of the key parameters that these \"high value\"\n   customers use to
    select a private pipe line provider.  This document\n   extends RSVP-TE protocol
    to promote SLA experince of latency\n   application.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
