abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization
    of\n   the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header\n   (ACH).
    \ RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be\n   carried in messages
    on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between\n   the fixed header fields and
    the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called\n   ACH TLVs\n\n   No Associated Channel
    Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,\n   it is believed that handling
    TLVs in hardware introduces significant\n   problems to the fast-path, and since
    G-ACh messages are intended to\n   be processed substantially in hardware, the
    use of TLVs in\n   undesirable.\n\n   This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring
    ACH TLVs and removing the\n   associated registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
