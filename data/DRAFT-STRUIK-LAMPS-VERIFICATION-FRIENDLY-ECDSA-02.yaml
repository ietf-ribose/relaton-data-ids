abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies how to represent ECDSA signatures so
    as to\n   facilitate accelerated verification of single signatures and fast\n
    \  batch verification.  We demonstrate that this representation\n   technique
    can be applied retroactively by any device (rather than\n   only by the signer),
    thereby facilitating transitioning to always\n   generating ECDSA signatures in
    this way, without changing\n   standardized ECDSA specifications with instantiations
    with prime-\n   order curves.  This facilitates verifying devices to reap the\n
    \  significant speed-up potential (ranging from ~1.3x to ~6x) fast\n   verification
    techniques afford.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
