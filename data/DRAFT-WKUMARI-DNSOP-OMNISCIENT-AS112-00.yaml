abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS)\n
    \  servers to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are\n   delegated.
    \ Queries for names within those zones have no useful\n   responses in a global
    context.  The purpose of the project is to\n   reduce the load of such junk queries
    on the authoritative name\n   servers that would otherwise receive them, directing
    the load instead\n   to name servers operated within the AS112 project.\n\n   Adding
    and dropping zones from the AS112 servers is difficult, due to\n   the loosely-coordinated
    nature of the project.  This document\n   proposes a mechanism by which AS112
    name servers could answer\n   authoritatively for all possible zones, reducing
    the add/drop problem\n   to one of delegation within the DNS without operational
    impact on the\n   servers themselves.\n\n   This document updates RFC 6304.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
