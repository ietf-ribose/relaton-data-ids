abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends PASSporT, which conveys cryptographically-\n
    \  signed information about the people involved in personal\n   communications,
    to include an indication that a call has been\n   diverted from its original destination
    to a new one.  This\n   information can greatly improve the decisions made by
    verification\n   services in call forwarding scenarios.  Also specified here is
    an\n   encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another\n   PASSporT
    that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
