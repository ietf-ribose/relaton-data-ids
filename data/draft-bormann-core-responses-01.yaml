abstract:
- content: "<p>In CoAP as defined by RFC 7252, responses are always unicast back to
    a client that posed a request. The present memo describes two forms of responses
    that go beyond that model. These descriptions are not intended as advocacy for
    adopting these approaches immediately, they are provided to point out potential
    avenues for development that would have to be carefully evaluated.</p>"
