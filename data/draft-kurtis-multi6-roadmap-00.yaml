abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 was decided as the replacement to the widely deployed IPv4 in
    1992. The new protocol was designed to meet a number of criteria that at that
    time was seen as the failures of IPv4, such as security and limited address space.
    IPv6 meet these needs, but it fails to meet other needs of the Internet of today
    such as scalable solutions for multihoming and portable address space for end-sites.
    The effects of the lack of scalable solutions to this is widely documented. In
    order to solve the multihoming scalability problems, the multi6 working group
    was created in the IETF. This group have so far not yet produced any documents
    as it has been hard to find consensus on even the most basic documents such as
    requirements. Multi6 have also suffered from problems reaching consensus on what
    type of solution will be required moving forward, and the attempt of trying to
    come up with a 'fit-all' solution from day one. This document tries to outline
    steps that could be taken to better understand the problem and what steps could
    be taken as we bit by bit tries to address the problem.</p>"
