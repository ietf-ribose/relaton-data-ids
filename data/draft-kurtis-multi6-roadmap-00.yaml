abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv6 was decided as the replacement to the widely deployed IPv4
    in1992. The new protocol was designed to meet a number of criteriathat at that
    time was seen as the failures of IPv4, such as securityand limited address space.IPv6
    meet these needs, but it fails to meet other needs of theInternet of today such
    as scalable solutions for multihoming andportable address space for end-sites.
    The effects of the lack ofscalable solutions to this is widely documented.In order
    to solve the multihoming scalability problems, the multi6working group was created
    in the IETF. This group have so far notyet produced any documents as it has been
    hard to find consensus oneven the most basic documents such as requirements. Multi6
    have alsosuffered from problems reaching consensus on what type of solutionwill
    be required moving forward, and the attempt of trying to come upwith a 'fit-all'
    solution from day one.This document tries to outline steps that could be taken
    to betterunderstand the problem and what steps could be taken as we bit by bittries
    to address the problem.</p>"
