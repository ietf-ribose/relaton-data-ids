abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There is an strong demand from IP network operators to obtain
    a\nmethod to control the network resource and enhance network\nperformance. The
    answer for this is Traffic Engineering. It is\nderived through the effort in MPLS
    wg. But current, the concept of\nTraffic Engineering seems to be limited to a
    few keywords, namely\nload balancing and restoration.\nThe aim of this document
    is to enhance the concept of traffic\nengineering and point out some aspects of
    what it is capable of. The\ngoal of this document is accomplished if this document
    could\nenlighten the perspective of IP Traffic Engineering and show a\npossible
    direction. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
