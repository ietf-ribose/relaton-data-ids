abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how hosts using IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    can be used in a MANET, without a need for any change, neither in functioning
    of Neighbor Discovery nor in MANET protocols. In addition, legacy hosts nor other
    parts of the network are faced any deviation on the IPv6 Addressing architecture.</p>"
