abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and tunneling
    paradigms where a source node can choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop
    signaling. This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
    Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate SR-TE paths
    that also have a local service segments involved.</p>"
