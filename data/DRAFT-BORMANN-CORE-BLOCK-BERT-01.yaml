abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP (RFC7252) is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained
    nodes\n   and networks, originally using UDP or DTLS over UDP as its transport.\n
    \  Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we expect from\n   temperature
    sensors, light switches, and similar building-automation\n   devices.  CoAP's
    Block protocol (draft-ietf-core-block) allows\n   transferring larger payloads
    over limited-size datagrams -- for\n   instance, for firmware updates.\n\n   CoAP
    over TCP and TLS (draft-ietf-core-tcp-tls) enables the use of\n   extended, but
    not unlimited, size messages.  The present\n   specification, Block-wise transfers
    in CoAP: Extension for Reliable\n   Transport (BERT), extends the block protocol
    in a simple way to be\n   able to make use of these larger messages over a reliable
    transport.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
