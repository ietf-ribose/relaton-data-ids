abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents techniques built upon BGP/IP MPLS VPN
    control\n   plane mechanisms to construct virtual topologies for service\n   chaining.
    These virtual service topologies interconnect network zones\n   and constrain
    the flow of traffic between these zones via a sequence\n   of service nodes so
    that service functions can be applied to the\n   traffic.\n\n   This document
    also describes approaches enabled by both the routing\n   control plane and by
    network orchestration to realize these virtual\n   service topologies.\n\n\t </p>\n
