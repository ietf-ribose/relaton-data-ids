abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
    between a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to be tunneled
    using IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP encapsulation headers. In this document, Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) tunneling is proposed as an alternative tunnel technology
    which is used between a MAG and a LMA. MPLS is now become more and more popular,
    and MPLS support is an important function for edge and core routers. Integrating
    MPLS and Proxy IP Mobility can leverage Proxy IP Mobility deployment in the industry.</p>"
