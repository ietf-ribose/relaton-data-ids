abstract:
  content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 trafficbetween
    a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway(MAG) to be tunneled using
    IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP encapsulationheaders. In this document, Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS)tunneling is proposed as an alternative tunnel technology which
    isused between a MAG and a LMA. MPLS is now become more and morepopular, and MPLS
    support is an important function for edge and corerouters. Integrating MPLS and
    Proxy IP Mobility can leverage ProxyIP Mobility deployment in the industry.</p>"
