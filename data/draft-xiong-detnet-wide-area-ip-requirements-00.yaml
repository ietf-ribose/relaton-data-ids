abstract:
- content: "<p>In wide-area IP networks, more requirements need to be taken into considerations
    such as differentiated DetNet QoS of multiple services, high-efficiency of resources
    utilization and routes steering, integration of large-scale heterogeneous network
    and guarantees of multiple dynamic deterministic flows. This document describes
    the requirements in wide-area applications and proposes the solution with deterministic
    resources, routes and QoS.</p>"
