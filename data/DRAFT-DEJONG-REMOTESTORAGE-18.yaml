abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This draft describes a protocol by which client-side applications,\n
    \   running inside a web browser, can communicate with a data storage\n    server
    that is hosted on a different domain name. This way, the\n    provider of a web
    application need not also play the role of data\n    storage provider. The protocol
    supports storing, retrieving, and\n    removing individual documents, as well
    as listing the contents of an\n    individual folder, and access control is based
    on bearer tokens.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
