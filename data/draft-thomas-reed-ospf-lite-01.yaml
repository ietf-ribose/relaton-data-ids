abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo documents what needs to be removed and added to OSPF [RFC2328]to
    create a working implementation of the experimental protocol ospf-lite. ospf-lite
    runs over TCP and UDP ports 8899.ospf-lite has been designed to provide a simpler
    version of the OSPFprotocol. A router running ospf-lite requires little configuration.Many
    of the Protocol complexities have been removed. Areas are notimplemented and Designated
    Router functionality has been removed fromthe protocol. In almost every case with
    these removals the protocol ismade more scalable.ospf-lite will run over non fully
    meshed NBMA clouds without explicitconfiguration.ospf-lite contains support for
    External LSA's and opaque LSA's. Theprotocol removes the support of LSA's type
    2,3,4,7 and the DR function.Promiscuous hellos are introduced and a unified interface
    link typereplaces existing link types.This work is intended to keep pace with
    the vast increases in processorperformance, memory size and link capacity since
    OSPF was originallyconceived.Where further details are required the authors refer
    the reader to [RFC2328].Please send comments to mrthom@essex.ac.uk</p>"
