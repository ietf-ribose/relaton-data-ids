abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
    designed\n   for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for
    the\n   ability to have basic security services defined for this data format.\n
    \  This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)\n   protocol.
    \ This specification describes how to create and process\n   signatures, message
    authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR\n   for serialization.  COSE additionally
    describes how to represent\n   cryptographic keys using CBOR.\n\n   In this specification
    the conventions for the use of a number of\n   cryptographic algorithms with COSE.
    \ The details of the structure of\n   COSE are defined in [I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].\n\n
    \  This document along with [I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-struct]\n   obsoletes
    RFC8152.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
