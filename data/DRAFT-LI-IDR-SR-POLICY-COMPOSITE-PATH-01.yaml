abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly\n
    \  indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node.  An SR\n   Policy
    is associated with one or more candidate paths.  A candidate\n   path is either
    dynamic, explicit or composite.  This document defines\n   extensions to BGP to
    distribute SR policies carrying composite\n   candidate path information.  So
    that composite candidate paths can be\n   installed when the SR policy is applied.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
