abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo presents a summary of scenarios, issues for consideration\nand
    protocol features for IPv6 network renumbering, i.e. achieving\nthe transition
    from the use of an existing network prefix to a new\nprefix in an IPv6 network.
    \ Its focus lies not in the procedure for\nrenumbering, but as a set of \"things
    to think about\" when undertaking\nsuch a renumbering exercise.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
