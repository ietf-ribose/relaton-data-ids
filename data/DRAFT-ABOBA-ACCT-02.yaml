abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The field of Accounting Management is concerned with the collection
    of\nresource consumption data for the purposes of capacity and trend\nanalysis,
    cost allocation, auditing, and billing. This document\ndescribes each of these
    problems, and discusses the issues involved in\ndesign of modern accounting systems.\nSince
    accounting applications do not have uniform security and\nreliability requirements,
    it is not possible to devise a single\naccounting protocol and set of security
    services that will meet all\nneeds. Thus the goal of accounting management is
    to provide a set of\ntools that can be used to meet the requirements of each application.\nThis
    document describes the currently available tools as well as the\nstate of the
    art in accounting protocol design. A companion document,\ndraft-brownlee-accounting-attributes-0x.txt,
    reviews the state of the\nart in accounting attributes and record formats.\n\n\n\n\n\t
