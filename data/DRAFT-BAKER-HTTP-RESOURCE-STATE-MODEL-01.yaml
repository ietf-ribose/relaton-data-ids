abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST,\nare
    not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whether\nIPP should have
    used POST or a new method, how to properly bind SOAP\nto HTTP, and the ever more
    common use of POST for tunneling new\nprotocols such as XML-RPC.  This note attempts
    to define an abstract\nmodel for the state of HTTP URI scheme addressable resources\nconsistent
    with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
