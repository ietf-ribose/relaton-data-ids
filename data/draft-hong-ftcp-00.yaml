abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to propose an improvement of TCP congestion
    control algorithm based on a very simple idea. One specific goal of FTCP is to
    smooth TCP traffic in order to improve the throughput, reduce losses and delay
    variation. FTCP algorithm is fully TCP-compatible [RFC 2914].</p>"
