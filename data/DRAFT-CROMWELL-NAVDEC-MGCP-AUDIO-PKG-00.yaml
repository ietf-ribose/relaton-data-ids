abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MGCP protocol describes a protocol for controlling a VOIP
    (Voice\n   Over IP) gateway from an external call agent.  The protocol defines
    a\n   number of event packages, each of which defines a group of events\n   supporting
    a particular type of gateway functionality.  For example,\n   there is a package
    for MF trunks, one for DTMF, and one for RTP.  A\n   gateway may support one or
    more packages depending on the functional-\n   ity it provides. A Residential
    Gateway might support the Generic\n   Media, DTMF, Line, and RTP packages while
    an MF Trunk Gateway could\n   support the Generic Media, MF, DTMF, MF Trunk, and
    RTP packages.\n \n   This document proposes a set of IVR-related events that constitute
    an\n   MGCP Announcement Package for use by an Announcement Server Gateway.\n
    \  This event package provides support for the standard IVR operations\n   of
    Play Announcement, Play Collect, and Play Record.  It supports\n   direct references
    to simple audio as well as indirect references to\n   simple and complex audio.
    It also provides multi-language audio vari-\n   ables, control of audio interruptibility,
    digit buffer control, spe-\n   cial key sequences, and support for reprompting
    during data collec-\n   tion.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
