abstract:
  content: "<p>It is desirable to allow firewalls and intrusion detection systems
    tobe able to inspect the payload of an ESP packet that has beenencrypted with
    the NULL cipher. This would allow a firewall to readthe contents and apply the
    normal policies to it. However, a devicein the network cannot reliably determine
    which ESP packets are NULLencrypted, and cannot easily determine other ESP format
    parameterssuch as the ICV length. These issues can cause misclassification ofpackets
    and wasted computational resources.This document solves this problem by defining
    an authentication-onlyprofile of ESP and reserving IP protocol numbers for it.</p>"
