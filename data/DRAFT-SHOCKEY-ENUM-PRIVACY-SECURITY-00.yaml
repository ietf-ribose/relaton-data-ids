abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Many individuals and groups have expressed concerns about the
    \n      privacy and security of personal information to be established in \n      implementations
    of RFC 2916. This document discusses some of the \n      technical as well as
    security and privacy considerations national \n      implementations of ENUM should
    consider. \n       \n      This is a work in progress. Input from security and
    privacy \n      experts is welcome.\n\t </p>\n      "
