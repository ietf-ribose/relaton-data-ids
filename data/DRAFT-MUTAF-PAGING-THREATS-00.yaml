abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document is an analysis of threats that arise from using
    \nlink layer paging technologies or IP paging in the Internet \nwhere denial-of-service
    attacks are common and easy. These \nproblems fall in the scope of IP paging,
    since link layer paging\ntechnologies do not have provisions for repelling such
    threats \nand the source of an attack may be anywhere in the Internet. In \naddition,
    vulnerabilities that may be added by IP paging are \nalso discussed.\n\t </p>\n
