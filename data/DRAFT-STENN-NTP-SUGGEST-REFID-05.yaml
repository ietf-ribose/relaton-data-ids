abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NTP's Reference ID, or REFID, identifies the source of time
    in a\n   timestamp or time packet.  In NTP packets sent over the network the\n
    \  REFID is used to identify the \"system peer\", and in the long-term\n   general
    case its fundamental purpose is to prevent a one-degree\n   timing loop.  Each
    instance of NTP decides for itself what REFID it\n   will put in its outgoing
    packets, and there is currently no way for\n   an external time source to tell
    or recommend this value in the case\n   where that external time source is selected
    as the \"system peer.\"\n\n   The SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension Field proposal
    is a backward-\n   compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or clients
    \"If you\n   use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID.\"\n\n\t
