abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Watching videos (Contents) from mobile devices has been causing
    most of\nthe network traffic and is projected to remain to increase\nexponentially.
    Thus, numerous types of content and chunk based caching\nschemes have been proposed
    to handle the increasing traffic. Those\ncaching schemes cache the whole videos
    at the edge nodes, but most\nof the users view only the beginning of the videos.
    Hence, caching\nthe complete video on the edge node is an ineffective solution
    to\nreduce the network traffic as well as to improve the cache\nutilization. Thus,
    a chunk-level caching scheme to store popular\nvideos partially and a smart prefetching
    scheme is needed to\nprovide the missing chunks of the video.\n\nThis Internet-Draft
    will expire on August 09, 2021.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
