abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An increasing number of hosts and networks are connected to
    the\n   Internet through multiple interfaces, some of which may provide\n   multiple
    ways to access the internet by the mean of multiple IPv6\n   prefix configurations.\n\n
    \  This document describes a way for hosts to retrieve additional\n   information
    about their network access characteristics.  The set of\n   configuration items
    required to access the Internet is called a\n   Provisioning Domain (PvD) and
    is identified by a Fully Qualified\n   Domain Name (FQDN).  This identifier, retrieved
    using a new Router\n   Advertisement (RA) option, is associated with the set of
    information\n   included within the RA and may later be used to retrieve additional\n
    \  information associated to the PvD by the mean of an HTTP request.\n\n\t </p>\n
