abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In MPLS and MPLS-TP environments, statically provisioned Single-\n
    \  Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against tunnel failure via\n   MPLS-level
    and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  With statically\n   provisioned Multi-Segment
    Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each segment of the\n   MS-PW is likewise protected from
    tunnel failures via MPLS-level and\n   MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  However,
    static MS-PWs are not\n   protected end-to-end against failure of one of the switching
    PEs\n   (S-PEs) along the path of the MS-PW.  This document describes how to\n
    \  achieve this protection by updating the existing procedures in RFC\n   6870.
    \ It also contains an optional approach based on MPLS-TP Linear\n   Protection.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
