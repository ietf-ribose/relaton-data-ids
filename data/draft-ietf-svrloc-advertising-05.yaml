abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution to the problem of finding information
    about that services are being offered at a particular Internet domain, based on
    deployment experience with the Netfind White Pages directory software. This approach
    makes it possible to supply clients with more information than the DNS aliases
    that have been widely deployed in this role - notably the port numbers being used
    by servers. However, it is not without problems, and we have tried to take account
    of these.</p>"
