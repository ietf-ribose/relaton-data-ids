abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 for long-term
    support,\n   one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for\n
    \  TLS 1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed.  This represents\n   a
    stable, known-good profile that can be deployed to systems that\n   can't roll
    out a new set of patches every month or two when the next\n   attack on TLS is
    published.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
