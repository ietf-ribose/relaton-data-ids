abstract:
- content: "<p>Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized hardware
    rather than on general purpose servers, but there is a clear trend to implement
    a number of network functions, such as firewall or load balancer, as software
    on virtualized computing platforms. These virtualized functions are called Virtualized
    Network Functions (VNFs), which can be used to build network services. The use
    of VNFs to build network services introduces additional challenges on reliability,
    such as additional points of failure and the need to coordinate various VNFs.
    This document introduces a general idea of VNF Pool to support reliable function
    provision by the VNFs. We then highlight the reliability challenges and issues
    when using the VNFs to build services. Related IETF works are also briefly described.</p>"
