abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an extension for OAM packet such as
    IP Ping\n   (ICMP [RFC0792] or ICMPv6 [RFC4443]) and MPLS LSP Ping [RFC8029],\n
    \  which can be used within an IOAM domain, allowing the IOAM\n   encapsulating
    node to acquire IOAM configuration data of each IOAM\n   transit node and/or IOAM
    decapsulating node easily and dynamically.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
