abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP has been used as the underlay routing protocol in many
    hyper-\n   scale data centers.  This document proposes a BGP neighbor\n   autodiscovery
    mechanism that greatly simplifies BGP deployments.\n   This mechanism is very
    useful for those hyper-scale data centers\n   where BGP is used as the underlay
    routing protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
