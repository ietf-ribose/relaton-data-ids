abstract:
  content: "<p>A method is proposed to enable communications between an IPv4-onlynode
    in today's Internet and an IPv6-only node, initiated by theIPv4-only node. The
    communication depends on allocation of a flowrecord and address triggered by a
    DNS query received for the targetv6-only node. DNS query conventions can be agreed
    upon to provide anatural model for resolving IPv4 queries for IPv6-only nodes.
    TheNAT mechanism proposed demultiplexes multiple sessions through thesame dynamically
    allocated IP address, using flow records matchingthe source address of incoming
    packets. This is in contrast to theuse of ports in NAT-PT boxes, which inhibits
    the support of incomingtraffic towards a node behind the NAT-PT.</p>"
