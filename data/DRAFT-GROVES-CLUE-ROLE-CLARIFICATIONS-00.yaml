abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There have been recent discussions on the CLUE and DISPATCH
    mailing\n   lists about \"roles\" associated with multimedia conferences.  From
    the\n   discussions it was apparent that there is some confusion as to what\n
    \  the current defined roles actually imply and that people had\n   different
    understanding of the meaning and scope of the term \"role\".\n   This draft seeks
    to identify the various \"roles\" that may be\n   associated with a multimedia
    conference and to provide a grouping and\n   nomenclature for further discussions
    on this topic.\n\n   Specific to CLUE this draft proposes a number of attributes
    to be\n   able to clearly identify the various roles that may be associated\n
    \  with a media capture.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
