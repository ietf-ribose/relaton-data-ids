abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a set of related protocol extensions to
    \nS/MIME, SMTP and DNS that collectively simplify deployment of \nS/MIME. Particular
    attention is given to ensuring that S/MIME \nauthenticated content is only received
    by end user clients capable \nof presenting the content in an acceptable manner.
    The proposal \nextends the ‘end-to-end’ security model of traditional S/MIME to
    \nsupport end-to-edge, edge-to-end and edge-to-edge use cases. \n\t </p>\n      "
