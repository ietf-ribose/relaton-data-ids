abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although the SIP History-Info header field is the solution
    adopted in\n   IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field is nevertheless already\n
    \  implemented and used for conveying call diversion related information\n   in
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.\n   On one hand, the non-standard
    Diversion header field is described, as\n   Historic, in [RFC5806].  On the other
    hand, the History-Info header\n   field is described in [RFC7044] that obsoletes
    the original[RFC4244]\n   describing the History-Info header field.  [RFC7044]
    defines the SIP\n   header field, History-Info, for capturing the history information
    in\n   requests and new SIP header field parameters for the History-Info and\n
    \  Contact header fields to tag the method by which the target of a\n   request
    is determined.  [RFC7044] also defines a value for the\n   Privacy header field
    that directs the anonymization of values in the\n   History-Info header field.\n\n
    \  Since the Diversion header field is used in existing network\n   implementations
    for the transport of call diversion information, its\n   interworking with the
    SIP History-Info standardized solution is\n   needed.  This document describes
    a recommended interworking guideline\n   between the Diversion header field and
    the History-Info header field\n   to handle call diversion information.  In addition,
    an interworking\n   policy is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence.  This
    work is\n   intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations\n
    \  and deployments toward IETF specification-based implementations and\n   deployments.\n
    \  This document obsoletes [RFC6044]that describes the interworking\n   between
    the Diversion header field [RFC5806] and the obsoleted\n   History-Info header
    field as defined on [RFC4244].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
