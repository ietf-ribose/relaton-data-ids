abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo documents a feature that significantly decreases\n        the
    initial LSDB synchronization time in Broadcast Multiple\n        Access (BMA)
    environments. This implementation only requires\n        a single OSPF speaker
    per psuedo-node to support this\n        functionality. These changes are implicitly
    supported within\n        the OSPFv2 protocol. This memo is not intended to serve
    as a\n        model for any other implementation.\n\t </p>\n      "
