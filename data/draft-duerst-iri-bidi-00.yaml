abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes how to deal with Internet identifiers containingcharacters
    from scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew, which use right-to-left or bidirectional
    writing. The solution proposed addresses threedifferent contexts: The purely graphical
    representation of suchidentifiers, e.g. on paper, the embedding of such identifiers
    intorunning text with established rules for bidirectionality, and theprocessing
    and resolution of such identifiers.</p>"
