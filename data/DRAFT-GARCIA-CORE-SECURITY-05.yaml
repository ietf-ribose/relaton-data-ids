abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A direct interpretation of the Internet of Things concept refers
    to\n   the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing\n
    \  or thing-to-thing communication.  Although the security needs are\n   well-recognized,
    it is still not fully clear how existing IP-based\n   security protocols can be
    applied to this new setting.  This\n   Internet-Draft first provides an overview
    of security architecture,\n   its deployment model and general security needs
    in the context of the\n   lifecycle of a thing.  Then, it presents challenges
    and requirements\n   for the successful roll-out of new applications and usage
    of standard\n   IP-based security protocols when applied to get a functional Internet\n
    \  of Things.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
