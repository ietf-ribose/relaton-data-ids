abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet storage services have become more and more popular.
    \ They\n   attract a huge number of users and produce a significant share of\n
    \  Internet traffic.  Most existing Internet storage services make use\n   of
    proprietary sync protocols with different capabilities to achieve\n   the data
    sync.  However, a single Internet storage service using its\n   proprietary sync
    protocols has intrinsic limitations on service\n   usability and network performance.
    \ This document outlines the\n   related problems caused by using proprietary
    sync protocols and\n   missing key capabilities.  It also shows a demand for designing
    a\n   standard sync protocol to achieve better usability and sync\n   performance.\n\n\t
