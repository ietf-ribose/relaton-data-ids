abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routing
    over IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter- domain exchange
    of telephone routing information. However, it can also be used as a means for
    gateways and soft switches to export their routing information to a Location Server
    (LS), which may be co-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can then manage
    those gateway resources. We discuss the motivations for this application, and
    then show how a subset of TRIP is needed for this application.</p>"
