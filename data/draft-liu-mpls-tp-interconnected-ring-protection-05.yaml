abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement (R93)
    that requires MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a network constructed
    from interconnected rings that protect user data that traverses more than one
    ring. In particular, This includes protecting against cases of failure at the
    ring-interconnect nodes and links. This document presents different scenario of
    interconnected rings and special mechanism to address recovery of the failure
    of ring-interconnect nodes and links. . This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
    Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
    Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
