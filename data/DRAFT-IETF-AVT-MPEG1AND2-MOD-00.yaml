abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes a packetization scheme for MPEG video and
    audio \nstreams.  The scheme proposed can be used to transport such a video \nor
    audio flow over the transport protocols supported by RTP.  Two \napproaches are
    described. The first is designed to support maximum \ninteroperability with MPEG
    System environments.  The second is \ndesigned to provide maximum compatibility
    with other RTP-encapsulated \nmedia streams and future conference control work
    of the IETF. \nMost of this memo is identical to RFC 2250, an Internet standards
    \ntrack RTP payload format definition. No changes have been made in the \npacket
    formats on the wire. The main reason for this revision is to \nallow the use of
    this payload format with dynamic payload types  \nthat can specify the timestamp
    clock frequency by non-RTP means for \nimproved jitter compensation. We used this
    opportunity to improve the \ndescription of the payload format specification by
    clarifying some \nwording that have been reported to be problematic. \n\t </p>\n
