abstract:
- content: "<p>The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in RFC 2418.
    However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in value and scope,
    since the writing of RFC 2418. This document updates RFC 2418 by providing a new
    definition of the Working Group Secretary's role. This document also provides
    a compilation of good practices and some general guidelines regarding the fulfilment
    of the role. This document is intended for established Working Group Secretaries,
    individuals desirous of taking up that role, or anyone else simply interested
    in understanding better the Working Group Secretary's role. This document may
    also be useful for Working Group Chairs to better appreciate and help develop
    the value of Working Group Secretaries.</p>"
