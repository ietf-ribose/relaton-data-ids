abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server such as during a network attack. Some DNS recursive
    resolver operators want to prevent snooping by third parties of requests sent
    to DNS root servers. Such resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and
    prevent observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the
    same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver software. This document
    shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause
    problems for other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility
    for the operator. [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, and so on should all be
    available there. The authors gratefully accept pull requests. ]</p>"
