abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a notion called Software-Defined Pricing (SDP)
    and introduces it into a Software-Defined Networks (SDN) framework. The SDN system
    with SDP inside is expected to promote the efficiency on SDN resources usage and
    ease management for service providers.This document also defines a mechanism that
    can efficiently mannage SDN framework orderly and intelligently.</p>"
