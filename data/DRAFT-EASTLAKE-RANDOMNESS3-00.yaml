abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms
    that\n   foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these\n   systems
    is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords,\n   cryptographic
    keys, and similar values. The use of pseudo-random\n   processes to generate secret
    quantities can result in pseudo-\n   security.  For example, the sophisticated
    attacker of these security\n   systems may find it easier to reproduce the environment
    that produced\n   the secret quantities, searching a resulting small set of\n
    \  possibilities, than to locate the quantities in the whole of the\n   potential
    number space.\n\n   Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated\n
    \  adversary can be surprisingly difficult. This document points out\n   many
    pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-\n   random number
    generation techniques for generating such quantities.\n   It recommends the use
    of multiple sources with a strong mixing\n   function, so that no single source
    need be fully trusted, and\n   provides techniques for extending a random seed
    to a larger quantity\n   of pseudo-random material in a cryptographically secure
    way. And it\n   gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some\n
    \  applications. This document obsoletes RFC 4086.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
