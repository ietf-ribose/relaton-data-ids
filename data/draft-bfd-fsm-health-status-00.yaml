abstract:
  content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection operates in different modes.When
    BFD runs in asynchronous mode requires hello packet needsto be transmitted and
    received on regular intervals. In softwarebased BFD application, hello packets
    processing path may beheavy weight which may involve many processing levels to
    reachBFD application. On a scaled system, processing delay may notbe constant
    at all the time and this processing delay does appearat any point between software
    path entry point and BFD application.This delay needs to be identified and suppressed
    otherwise systemmay end up on false link failure detection. This internet draftdeals
    on this particular case.Since introducing new Diagnostic bit, it requires to update
    RFC5880.</p>"
