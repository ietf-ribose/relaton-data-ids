abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for
    next-generation network security devices including next-generation firewalls (NGFW),
    intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/ IPS) and unified threat management
    (UTM) implementations. The document aims to strongly improve the applicability,
    reproducibility and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology
    with today's increasingly complex 7application use cases. The main areas covered
    in this document are test terminology, traffic profiles and benchmarking methodology
    for NGFWs to start with.</p>"
