abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies use cases, derived functional capabilities,
    and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating interoperable automation
    tools and continuous monitoring solutions that provide visibility into the state
    of endpoints, user activities, and network behavior. Stakeholders will be able
    to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational
    data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk,
    and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting
    critical information. Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment
    and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify
    and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these
    capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent
    misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</p>"
