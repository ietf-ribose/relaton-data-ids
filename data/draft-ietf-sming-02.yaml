abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo presents an object-oriented data definition language forthe
    specification of various kinds of management information. It isindependent of
    management protocols and applications. Protocolmappings are defined as extensions
    to this language in separatememos. The language builds on experiences gained with
    the SMIv2 andits derivate SPPI. It is expected that the language presented inthis
    memo along with its protocol mappings will replace the SMIv2and the SPPI in the
    long term.</p>"
