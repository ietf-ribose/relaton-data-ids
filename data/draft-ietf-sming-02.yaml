abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents an object-oriented data definition language for
    the specification of various kinds of management information. It is independent
    of management protocols and applications. Protocol mappings are defined as extensions
    to this language in separate memos. The language builds on experiences gained
    with the SMIv2 and its derivate SPPI. It is expected that the language presented
    in this memo along with its protocol mappings will replace the SMIv2 and the SPPI
    in the long term.</p>"
