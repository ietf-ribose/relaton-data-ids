abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memorandum describes how the HIP control packets can be used
    to\nsend requests for preferred certificates to the correspondent hosts,\nand
    also requests for a Certification Authority (CA) to issue a\ncertificate.  The
    document specifies two new HIP parameters CERT_REQ\nand CERT_SIGN_REQ and describes
    their use.  The means as to how to\nsignal an error in case of the desired certificate
    is not available\nis also discussed.  The syntax of certificates and certificate\nrequests
    is out of scope of the document and defined elsewhere.\n\t </p>\n      "
