abstract:
- content: "<p>There are some subtle considerations for an EAP peer regarding the
    content of the EAP-Response/Identity packet when authenticating with EAP to an
    EAP server. This document describes two such considerations and suggests workarounds
    to the associated problems. One of these workarounds is a new requirement for
    EAP peers that the use of UTF-8 is required for the content of EAP-Response/Identity
    (which updates RFC3748).</p>"
