abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to\n
    \  communicate.  For example, the IP address on the interface and the\n   DNS
    server for a hostname to IP address lookup.  This information is\n   configured
    statically or obtained dynamically using Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) or Point-to- Point Protocol/IP Control\n   Protocol (PPP/IPCP).  However,
    both DHCP and PPP/IPCP provides host\n   configuration based on the access network.
    \ In Mobile IPv4, the\n   registration process boots up a Mobile Node at an access
    network,\n   also known as foreign network.  The information to configure the
    host\n   needs to be based on the home network.  This document describes the\n
    \  extensions used to provide the base host configuration in the\n   Registration
    Request and Reply messages.\n\t </p>\n      "
