abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   AAA servers are in use within the Internet today to provide\n
    \  authentication and authorization services for dial-up computers.\n   Such services
    are likely to be equally valuable for mobile nodes\n   using Mobile IP when the
    nodes are attempting to connect to foreign\n   domains with AAA servers.  AAA
    servers today identify clients by\n   using the Network Access Identifier (NAI).
    \ Our proposal defines a\n   way for the mobile node to identify itself, by including
    the NAI\n   along with the Mobile IP Registration Request.  This memo also\n\n\n
    \  updates RFC 2290 which specifies the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration option\n   for
    IPCP, by allowing the Mobile Node's Home Address field of this\n   option to be
    zero and specifying a comprehensive procedure for\n   achieving a NAI-based home
    address assignment and more particularly,\n   the Home Agent and Mobile Node behaviors
    including the error recovery\n   mechanisms for various scenarios related to NAI-based
    home address\n   assignment.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
