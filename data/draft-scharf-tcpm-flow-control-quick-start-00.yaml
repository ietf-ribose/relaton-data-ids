abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes extensions for the flow control of theTransmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) that avoid interactions with faststartup congestion control
    mechanisms, in particular the Quick-StartTCP extension. Quick-Start is an optional
    TCP extension that allowsto start data transfers with a large congestion window,
    usingfeedback of the routers along the path. This can avoid the timeconsuming
    Slow-Start, provided that the TCP flow control is not alimiting factor.There are
    two potential interactions between the TCP flow control andcongestion control
    schemes without the standard Slow-Start: First,receivers might not allocate a
    sufficiently large buffer space afterconnection setup, or they may advertise a
    receive window implicitlyassuming the Slow-Start behavior on the sender side.
    This documenttherefore provides guidelines for buffer allocation in hostssupporting
    the Quick-Start extension. Second, the TCP receive windowscaling mechanism can
    prevent fast startups immediately after theinitial three-way handshake connection
    setup. This documentdescribes a simple solution to overcome this problem.</p>"
