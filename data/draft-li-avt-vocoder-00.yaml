abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable
    Rate Codec (EVRC) Speech and Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) Speech. Other vocoders
    which share common characteristics with EVRC and SMV can be easily supported by
    following the procedures specified in this document. The packet format supports
    various formats for different application scenarios. A bundled/interleaved format
    is included to reduce the effect of packet loss on Speech quality. A non-bundled
    format is also supported for conversational applications.</p>"
