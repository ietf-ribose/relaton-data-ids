abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo gives an implementation recommendation for SMTP [1]
    MTAs\n(Mail Transfer Agents) to make them more capable of reducing the\nimpact
    of spam(*).\n\nAlthough this recommendation is not the 'final solution', if applied\non
    enough SMTP MTAs on the Internet, the recommendation will force\nspammers into
    the open, where they can be dealt with.\n\nA brief summary of the recommendation
    is:\n\no   Register all MTAs within DNS\no   Verify the combination of sender
    and sending MTA\n\t </p>\n      "
