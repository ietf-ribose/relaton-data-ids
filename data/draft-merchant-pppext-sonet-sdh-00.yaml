abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard mechanism
    for transport of multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. There is
    currently significant interest and activity in transporting PPP over SONET links,
    and RFC 1619 [2] and RFC 1662 [3], both from 1994, have so far provided most of
    the basis for implementation of such a transport. Recent needs, proposals and
    standards have recently progressed beyond these two RFCs, as well as identified
    limitations of the methods described in the aforementioned RFCs for effective
    implementation at very high data rates in the vicinity of 10 Gb/s (STS-192c/OC-192).
    This document (A) attempts to consolidates (sometimes by reference) current standards
    and current practice in transport of PPP over SONET; (B) attempts to document
    current viewpoints that share some degree of consensus in recent developments
    in this area and (C) proposes for STS-192c/OC-192 transmission a simple, efficient
    and robust 32-bit-word-oriented framing mechanism based on HDLC, called HDLC-32,
    which is significantly more conducive to efficient implementation at high data
    rates in the vicinity of 10 Gb/s (STS-192c/OC-192) than the HDLC framing currently
    used at lower rates.</p>"
