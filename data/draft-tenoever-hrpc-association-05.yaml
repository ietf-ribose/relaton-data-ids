abstract:
- content: "<p>This document scopes the relation between Internet protocols and the
    right to freedom of assembly and association. Increasingly, the Internet mediates
    our lives, our relationships and our ability to exercise our human rights. The
    Internet provides a global public space, but one that is built predominantly on
    private infrastructure. Since Internet protocols play a central role in the management,
    development and use of the Internet, the relation between protocols and the aforementioned
    rights should be documented and any adverse impacts of this relation should be
    mitigated.</p>"
