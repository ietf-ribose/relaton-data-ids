abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have
    the\n   requirement for IPv4 configuration.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]\n   provides
    a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 configuration information\n   dynamically in IPv6
    networks.  DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Active Leasequery allows\n   a client to get real-time
    DHCP address binding information data via\n   TCP.  This document describes an
    extension of DHCPv6 Active\n   Leasequery to provide an mechanism to getting real-time
    DHCPv4 over\n   DHCPv6 lease information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
