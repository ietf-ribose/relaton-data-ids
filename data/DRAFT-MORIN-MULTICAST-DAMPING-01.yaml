abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes procedures to damp multicast routing
    state\n   changes and prevent the churn due to the multicast dynamicity at the\n
    \  edge of a network.  The procedures described in this document help\n   avoid
    uncontrolled control plane load increase on the core routing\n   infrastructure.
    \ New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP\n   unicast route damping principles,
    but adapted to multicast.  They\n   cover multicast and multicast in VPNs contexts.\n\n\n\t
