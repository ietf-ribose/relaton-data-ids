abstract:
- content: <p>RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades, without
    rigorously defining them as managed entities. During this time, RADIUS implementations
    have named the data types, and have used them to as managed entities in attribute
    definitions. This document updates the specifications to match established prctice.
    We do this by naming data types defined in [RFC6158], which have been used since
    at least [RFC2865]. We provide an IANA registry for the data types, and update
    the RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a "data type" field for each attribute.
    Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS specifications use these types in
    preference to existing practice.</p>
