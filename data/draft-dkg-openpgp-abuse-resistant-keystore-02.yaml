abstract:
  content: <p>OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up
    of primary keys, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity certifications ("signature
    packets"), subkeys, and so on. They are often assembled by merging multiple certificates
    that all share the same primary key, and are distributed in public keystores.
    Unfortunately, since many keystores permit any third-party to add a certification
    with any content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged form of a certificate
    can become unwieldy or undistributable. Furthermore, keystores that are searched
    by user ID can be made unusable for specific names or addresses by public submission
    of bogus data. And finally, keystores open to public submission can also face
    simple resource exhaustion from flooding with bogus submissions, or legal or other
    risks from uploads of toxic data. This draft documents techniques that an archive
    of OpenPGP certificates can use to mitigate the impact of these various attacks.</p>
