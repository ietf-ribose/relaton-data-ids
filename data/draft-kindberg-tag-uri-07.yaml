abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the \"tag\" Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) scheme. Tag URIs (also known as \"tags\") are designed to be unique across
    space and time while being tractable to humans. They are distinct from most other
    URIs in that they have no authoritative resolution mechanism. A tag may be used
    purely as an entity identifier. Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over
    the common practice of using \"http\" URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible
    resources. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
