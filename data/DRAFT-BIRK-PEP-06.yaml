abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe
    a set of\n   conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as\n
    \  barriers to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end-\n   to-end
    interpersonal messaging.  These include, but are not limited\n   to, key management,
    key discovery, and private key handling\n   (including peer-to-peer synchronization
    of private keys and other\n   user data across devices).  Human Rights-enabling
    principles like\n   Data Minimization, End-to-End and Interoperability are explicit\n
    \  design goals.  For the goal of usable privacy, pEp introduces means\n   to
    verify communication between peers and proposes a trust-rating\n   system to denote
    secure types of communications and signal the\n   privacy level available on a
    per-user and per-message level.\n   Significantly, the pEp protocols build on
    already available security\n   formats and message transports (e.g., PGP/MIME
    with email), and are\n   written with the intent to be interoperable with already
    widely-\n   deployed systems in order to ease adoption and implementation.  This\n
    \  document outlines the general design choices and principles of pEp.\n\n\t </p>\n
