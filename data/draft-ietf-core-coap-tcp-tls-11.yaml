abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP,
    was designed to use UDP instead of TCP. The message layer of CoAP over UDP includes
    support for reliable delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control. Some
    environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over reliable transports
    such as TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS). This document outlines the changes
    required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports. It also formally
    updates RFC 7641 for use with these transports and RFC 7959 to enable the use
    of larger messages over a reliable transport.</p>"
