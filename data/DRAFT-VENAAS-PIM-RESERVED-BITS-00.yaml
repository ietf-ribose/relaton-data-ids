abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The currently defined PIM version 2 messages share a common
    message\n   header format.  The common header definition contains eight reserved\n
    \  bits.  This document specifies how these bits may be used by\n   individual
    message types, and creates a registry containing the per\n   message type usage.
    \ This document also extends the PIM type space by\n   defining a new message
    type where four of the flag bits are used as\n   an extended type range.\n\n   This
    document Updates RFC7761 and RFC3973 by defining the use of the\n   currently
    Reserved field in the PIM common header.  This document\n   further updates RFC7761
    and RFC3973, along with RFC5015, RFC6754 and\n   I-D.ietf-pim-source-discovery-bsr,
    by specifying the use of the\n   currently Reserved bits for each PIM message.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
