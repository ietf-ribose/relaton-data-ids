abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes the general problem of encryption of the Server
    Name Identification (SNI) parameter. The proposed solutions hide a Hidden Service
    behind a Fronting Service, only disclosing the SNI of the Fronting Service to
    external observers. The draft starts by listing known attacks against SNI encryption,
    and then presents two potential solutions that might mitigate these attacks. The
    first solution is based on TLS in TLS "quasi tunneling", and the second solution
    is based on "combined tickets". These solutions only require minimal extensions
    to the TLS protocol.</p>
