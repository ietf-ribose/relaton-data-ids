abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
    hardware device identifiers. A general representation of device identity can be
    useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage, or equipment
    inventories. A URN-based representation can be easily passed along in any application
    that needs the information.</p>"
