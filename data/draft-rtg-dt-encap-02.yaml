abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Routing Area director has chartered a design team to look
    at common issues for the different data plane encapsulations being discussed in
    the NVO3 and SFC working groups and also in the BIER BoF, and also to look at
    the relationship between such encapsulations in the case that they might be used
    at the same time. The purpose of this design team is to discover, discuss and
    document considerations across the different encapsulations in the different WGs/BoFs
    so that we can reduce the number of wheels that need to be reinvented in the future.</p>"
