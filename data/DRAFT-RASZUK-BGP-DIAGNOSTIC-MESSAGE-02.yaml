abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BGP protocol lacks self diagnostic tools which would allow for\nmonitoring
    and detection of any possible bgp state database\ndifferences between BGP_RIB_Out
    of the sender and BGP_RIB_In of the\nreceiver over BGP peering session.  It also
    lacks of build in\nmechanism to inform peer about subset of prefixes received
    over\nsession which experienced some errors and which per protocol\nspecification
    either resulted in attribute drop or \"treat-as-\nwithdraw\" action.\n\nThe intention
    of this document is to start a new class of work which\nwill make BGP protocol
    and therefor assuring services constructed\nwith the help of BGP protocol to become
    much more reliable and\nrobust.\n\t </p>\n      "
