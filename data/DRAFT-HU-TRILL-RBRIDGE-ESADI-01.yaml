abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without\n   configuration
    in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and\n   safe forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops. TRILL\n   supports the multi-pathing of both unicast
    and multicast traffic.\n   TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate
    System to\n   Intermediate System) link state routing and encapsulating traffic\n
    \  using a header that includes a hop count.\n\n   The ESADI (End System Address
    Distribution Information) protocol is a\n   VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
    scoped way that RBridge can\n   communicate end station addresses to each other.
    \ An RBridge\n   announcing VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x forwarder)
    and\n   running the TRILL ESADI protocol can receive remote address\n   information
    and/or transmit local address information for VLAN-x to\n   other such RBridges.
    \ The purpose of this document is to improve and\n   update the documentation
    of the ESADI protocol. It updates RFC 6325.\n   The ESADI RBridge instance states,
    DRB (Designated RBridge) election\n   procedure, and ESADI sub-TLV are specified
    in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
