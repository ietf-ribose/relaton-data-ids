abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Emergency alerts need to be delivered reliably from one source
    to\n   many recipients at once.  TCP is unsuitable for this style of\n   delivery,
    because the large number of acknowledgements would likely\n   cause network congestion.
    \ This document defines a UDP-based protocol\n   for delivering alerts that supports
    fragmentation and retransmission\n   for reliability, and allows the sender of
    a datagram to control\n   whether acknowledgements are sent.\n\n   Please send
    feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
