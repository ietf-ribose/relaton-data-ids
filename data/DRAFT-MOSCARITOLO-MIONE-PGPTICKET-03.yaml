abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>OpenPGP specifies message formats and certificate formats used
    for\nexchange of encrypted and/or authenticated objects. This document\ndiscusses
    methods of extending OpenPGP's message formats to support\nan authorization system.
    This system would use public key\ncryptography to authenticate a user to a server
    and establish the\nuser's access permissions. The concept is that the user acquires
    a\nticket signed by some issuer that specifies what they are entitled to\ndo.
    That ticket is then submitted to a server. The server uses a\nchallenge/response
    method to verify that the holder really has the\nmatching private key. The server
    then allows the access specified.\n\t </p>\n      "
