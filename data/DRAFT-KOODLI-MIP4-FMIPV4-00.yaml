abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Mobile IPv6 fast handover document [2] specifies a protocol
    to\n   improve latency and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv6 handover\n   operations.
    \ This document adapts the protocol for IPv4 networks\n   to improve performance
    over Mobile IPv4 operations, including\n   processing of Agent Advertisements,
    new Care of Address acquisition\n   and Registration Request and Reply.  However,
    operation without\n   Foreign Agent function at a router is also feasible.  In
    addition,\n   the protocol may be used transparently on hosts which do not support\n
    \  Mobile IP, but with limited movement across subnets.  Using the\n   concepts
    outlined in [2], this document also addresses movement\n   detection, IP address
    configuration and location update latencies\n   during a handover.  For reducing
    the IP address configuration, the\n   document currently proposes that the new
    CoA is always made to be the\n   new access router's IP address.  Additional mechanisms
    may be defined\n   in the future versions of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
