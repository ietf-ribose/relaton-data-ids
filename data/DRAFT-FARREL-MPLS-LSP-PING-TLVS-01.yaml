abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Techniques for detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS)
    data\nplane failures are described in RFC 4379 and include the definition\nof
    a control protocol for testing and verifying Label Switched Path\n(LSP) connectivity
    that is known as LSP Ping. The protocol consists\nof a set of messages each of
    which contains data encoded as TLVs.\n\nThe LSP Ping protocol is being extended
    for several related uses.\nEach extension gives rise to the definition of new
    TLVs to be carried\non the existing protocol messages.\n\nThe LSP Ping specification
    makes it mandatory that all TLVs are\nunderstood by each participating Label Switching
    Router (LSR) that\nreceives an LSP Ping message. This makes future extensibility
    hard\nwithout upgrading all LSRs in the network.\nThis document defines ranges
    in the TLV codepoint space so that TLVs\nmay be associated with different processing
    rules within an LSR if\nthe TLV is unknown. This will make extensibility more
    simple.\n\t </p>\n      "
