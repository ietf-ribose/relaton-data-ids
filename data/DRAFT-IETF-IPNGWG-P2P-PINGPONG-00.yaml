abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In IPv6 point-to-point link operation, there is a significant\npossibility
    of aberrant behavior in that packets may ping-pong between\nthe two ends of the
    link.  The problem can lead to wasted bandwidth and\ncan possibly be abused by
    malicious parties.  This document provides an\nanalysis and solution to the problem.\n\n\t
