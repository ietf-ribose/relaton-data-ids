abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo proposes requirements for protocols between web browsersand
    relying parties at websites; these requirements also impact thirdparties involved
    in the authentication process. These requirementsminimize the likelihood that
    criminals will be able to gain thecredentials necessary to impersonate a user
    or be able tofraudulently convince users to disclose personal information. Tomeet
    these requirements browsers must change. Websites must neverreceive information
    such as passwords that can be used to impersonatethe user to third parties. Browsers
    should authenticate the websiteto the browser as part of authenticating the user
    to the website.Browsers MUST flag situations when this authentication fails and
    flagsituations when the target website is not authorized to accept theidentity
    being offered as this is a strong indication of fraud.These requirements may serve
    as a basis for requirements forpreventing fraud in environments other than the
    web.</p>"
