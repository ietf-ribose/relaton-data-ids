abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC0791] defines two IPv4 options called "Strict Source Routing" and
    "Loose Source Routing". Functionality provided by these options can be exploited
    in order to perform remote network discovery, to bypass firewalls and to achieve
    packet amplification for the purposes of generating denial-of-service traffic.
    This document updates RFC 791 to deprecate the use of the IPv4 Strict Source Routing
    Option as well as the IPv4 Loose Source Routing Option.</p>
