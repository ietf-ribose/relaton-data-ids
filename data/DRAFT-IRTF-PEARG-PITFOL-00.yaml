abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Software systems typically generate log messages in the course
    of\n   their operation.  These log messages (or 'logs') record events as\n   they
    happen, thus providing a trail that can be used to understand\n   the state of
    the system and help with troubleshooting issues.  Given\n   that logs try to capture
    state that is useful for monitoring and\n   debugging, they can contain information
    that can be used to identify\n   users.  Personal data identification and anonymization
    in logs is\n   crucial to ensure that no personal data is being inadvertently
    logged\n   and retained which would make the logging system run afoul of laws\n
    \  around storing private information.  This document focuses on\n   exploring
    mechanisms that can be used by a generating or intermediary\n   logging service
    to specify personal or sensitive data in log\n   message(s), thus allowing a downstream
    logging server to potentially\n   enforce any redaction or transformation.\n\n\n\t
