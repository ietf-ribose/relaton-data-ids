abstract:
- content: "<p>The current proposal for multicast in BGP/MPLS includes multiple alternative
    mechanisms for some of the required building blocks of the solution. The aim of
    this document is to leverage previously documented requirements to identify the
    key elements and help move forward solution design, toward the definition of a
    standard having a well defined set of mandatory procedures. The different proposed
    alternative mechanisms are examined in the light of requirements identified for
    multicast in L3VPNs, and suggestions are made about which of these mechanisms
    standardization should favor. Issues related to existing deployments of early
    implementations are also addressed.</p>"
