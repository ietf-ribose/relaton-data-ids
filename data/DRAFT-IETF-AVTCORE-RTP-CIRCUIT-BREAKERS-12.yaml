abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,\n
    \  video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications\n   are
    often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control\n   is not implemented
    in the applications, then network congestion will\n   deteriorate the user's multimedia
    experience.  This acts as a safety\n   measure to prevent starvation of network
    resources denying other\n   flows from access to the Internet, such measures are
    essential for an\n   Internet that is heterogeneous and for traffic that is hard
    to\n   predict in advance.  This document does not propose a congestion\n   control
    algorithm; instead, it defines a minimal set of RTP circuit-\n   breakers.  Circuit-breakers
    are conditions under which an RTP sender\n   needs to stop transmitting media
    data in order to protect the network\n   from excessive congestion.  It is expected
    that, in the absence of\n   severe congestion, all RTP applications running on
    best-effort IP\n   networks will be able to run without triggering these circuit\n
    \  breakers.  Any future RTP congestion control specification will be\n   expected
    to operate within the constraints defined by these circuit\n   breakers.\n\n\t
