abstract:
  content: "\t <t>One goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a \"onceand
    only once\" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] isimplemented
    by a number of software tools on a variety of platformswith varying capabilities
    and with varying network service quality.Although the AS2 protocol defines a unique
    \"Message-ID\", currentimplementations of AS2 do not provide a standard method
    to preventthe same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from reachingback-end
    business applications at the initial receiver.A second goal is to reduce retransmissions
    and failures when AS2 is usedin a synchronous mode for transmitting MDNs. There
    can be a largelatency between receipt of the POSTed entity body and the MDN responsecaused
    by the operations of decompressing, decrypting, and signaturechecks. Uncoordinated
    timeout policies and intermediate devices droppingconnections have interfered
    with reliable data exchange. The use of anHTTP 102(Processing) status code is
    described to mitigate thesedifficulties. Use of these reliability features is
    indicated bypresence of the \"AS2-Reliability\" value in the EDIINT-Features header.Intended
    StatusThe intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as anInformational
    RFC.Feedback Instructions:NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: This section should be removed by
    the RFC editorprior to publication.If you want to provide feedback on this draft,
    follow theseguidelines:-Send feedback via e-mail to the ietf-ediint list for discussion,with
    \"AS2 Reliability\" in the Subject field. To enter or follow thediscussion, you
    need to subscribe to ietf-ediint@imc.org.-Be specific as to what section you are
    referring to, preferablyquoting the portion that needs modification, after which
    you stateyour comments.-If you are recommending some text to be replaced with
    your suggestedtext, again, quote the section to be replaced, and be clear on thesection
    in question.</p>"
