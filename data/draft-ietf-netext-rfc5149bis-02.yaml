abstract:
- content: "<p>In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying the mobile node or the
    mobility service subscriber is not enough to distinguish between multiple services
    possibly provisioned to the mobile node and its mobility service subscription.
    A capability to specify different services in addition to the mobile node identity
    can be leveraged to provide flexibility for mobility service providers on provisioning
    multiple services to one mobility service subscription. This document describes
    a Service Selection Mobility Option for both conventional Mobile IPv6 and Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 that is intended to assist home agents and local mobility agents to
    make a specific service selection for the mobility service subscription during
    the binding registration procedure. This specification updates RFC5213 and obsoletes
    RFC5149.</p>"
