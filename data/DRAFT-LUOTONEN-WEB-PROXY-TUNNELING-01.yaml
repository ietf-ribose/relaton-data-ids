abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a generic tunneling mechanism for TCP
    based\n   protocols through Web proxy servers.  This tunneling mechanism was\n
    \  initially introduced for the SSL protocol [SSL] to allow secure Web\n   traffic
    to pass through firewalls, but its utility is not limited to\n   SSL.  Earlier
    drafts of this specification were titled 'Tunneling SSL\n   through Web Proxy
    Servers' &lt;draft-luotonen-ssl-tunneling-XX.txt&gt;.\n   Implementations of this
    tunneling feature are commonly referred to as\n   'SSL tunneling', although, again,
    it can be used for tunneling any\n   TCP based protocol.\n \n   A wide variety
    of existing client and proxy server implementations\n   conform to this specification.
    \ The purpose of this specification is\n   to describe the current practice, to
    propose some good practices for\n   implementing this specification, and to document
    the security\n   considerations that are involved with this protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
