abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Multicast
    DNS\n   allows discovery only of services present on the local link.  Using a\n
    \  very large local link with thousands of hosts improves service\n   discovery,
    but at the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.\n\n   Performing DNS-Based
    Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is\n   more efficient, but requires
    configuration of DNS Update keys on the\n   devices offering the services, which
    can be onerous for simple\n   devices like printers and network cameras.\n\n   Hence
    a compromise is needed, that provides easy service discovery\n   without requiring
    either large amounts of multicast traffic or\n   onerous configuration.\n\n\t
