abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A policy architecture and framework is discussed to support
    NFV\n   environments, where policies are used to enforce business rules and\n
    \  to specify resource constraints in a number of subsystems. This\n   document
    approaches the policy framework and architecture from the\n   perspective of overall
    orchestration requirements for services\n   involving multiple subsystems. The
    framework extends beyond common\n   orchestration constraints across compute,
    network, and storage\n   subsystems to include energy conservation. This document
    also\n   analyses policy scope, global versus local policies, static versus\n
    \  dynamic versus autonomic policies, policy actions and translations,\n   policy
    conflict detection and resolution, interactions among policies\n   engines, and
    a hierarchical policy architecture/framework to address\n   the demanding and
    growing requirements of NFV environments. These\n   findings may also be applicable
    to cloud infrastructures in general.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
