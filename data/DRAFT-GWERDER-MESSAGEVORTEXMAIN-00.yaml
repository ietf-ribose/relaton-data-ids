abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MessageVortex Protocol specifies messages embedded within existing\n
    \  transfer protocols such as SMTP or XMPP to send them anonymously from\n   peer
    to peer.\n\n   The protocol outperforms other protocols by decoupling transport
    from\n   the final transmitter and receiver party.  There is no trust put into\n
    \  any infrastructure except for the infrastructure of the sending and\n   receiving
    party of a message.  The Message flow is entirely selected\n   by the creator
    of the routing block.  Routing nodes gain no non-\n   obvious knowledge about
    messages even when collaborating.  Third-\n   party anonymity is always achieved.
    \ Furthermore, one out of sender\n   and receiver anonymity may be achieved.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
