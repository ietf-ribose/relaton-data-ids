abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Protection and restoration at optical layer is critical to network\nintegrity
    since data is transmitted and switched at a considerably \nhigh speed in optical
    domain. A few second halt may cause tens to \nthousands gigabit loss. Optical
    burst switching is a promising \ntechnology, bridging optical circuit switching
    and optical package \nswitching. Unlike optical circuit switching and time division
    \nmultiplexing, OBS is featured with unidirectional reservation and \nstatistical
    multiplexing of wavelength resources. The general idea \nbehind protection and
    restoration techniques is to utilize redundant\nbandwidth resources as backup.
    The flexibility brought by OBS \nprovides alternatives for existed protection
    and restoration schemes \nat optical layer. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
