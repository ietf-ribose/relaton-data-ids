abstract:
  content: "\t <t>While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types
    ofwavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend the controlplane to
    networks that include a combination of transparent opticaland hybrid electro optical
    systems such as OEO switches,regenerators, and wavelength converters. Such networks
    are frequentlyreferred to as translucent optical networks in the literature. Someof
    the systems use in such networks can be limited to processing WSONsignals with
    specific characteristics or attributes. In addition,some of the network elements
    may be able to perform importantoptional processing functions such as regeneration
    on a signal andwould need to be provisioned as part of optical path establishment.This
    document provides a WSON signal definition and attributescharacterization based
    on ITU-T interface and signal class standardsand describes the signal compatibility
    constraints of this extendedset of network elements. The signal characterization,
    network elementcompatibility constraints and enhanced provisioning support enableGMPLS
    routing and signaling to control these devices and PCE tocompute optical light-paths
    subject to signal compatibilityattributes.</p>"
