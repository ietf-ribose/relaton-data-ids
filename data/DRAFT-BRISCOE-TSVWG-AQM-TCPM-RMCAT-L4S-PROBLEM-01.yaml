abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document motivates a new service that the Internet could
    provide\n   to eventually replace best efforts for all traffic: Low Latency, Low\n
    \  Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S).  It is becoming common for _all_ (or\n   most)
    applications being run by a user at any one time to require low\n   latency.  However,
    the only solution the IETF can offer for ultra-low\n   queuing delay is Diffserv,
    which only favours a minority of packets\n   at the expense of others.  In extensive
    testing the new L4S service\n   keeps average queuing delay under a millisecond
    for _all_\n   applications even under very heavy load, without sacrificing\n   utilization;
    and it keeps congestion loss to zero.  It is becoming\n   widely recognized that
    adding more access capacity gives diminishing\n   returns, because latency is
    becoming the critical problem.  Even with\n   a high capacity broadband access,
    the reduced latency of L4S\n   remarkably and consistently improves performance
    under load for\n   applications such as interactive video, conversational video,
    voice,\n   Web, gaming, instant messaging, remote desktop and cloud-based apps\n
    \  (even when all being used at once over the same access link).  The\n   insight
    is that the root cause of queuing delay is in TCP, not in the\n   queue.  By fixing
    the sending TCP (and other transports) queuing\n   latency becomes so much better
    than today that operators will want to\n   deploy the network part of L4S to enable
    new products and services.\n   Further, the network part is simple to deploy -
    incrementally with\n   zero-config.  Both parts, sender and network, ensure coexistence
    with\n   other legacy traffic.  At the same time L4S solves the long-\n   recognized
    problem with the future scalability of TCP throughput.\n\n   This document explains
    the underlying problems that have been\n   preventing the Internet from enjoying
    such performance improvements.\n   It then outlines the parts necessary for a
    solution and the steps\n   that will be needed to standardize them.  It points
    out opportunities\n   that will open up, and sets out some likely use-cases, including\n
    \  ultra-low latency interaction with cloud processing over the public\n   Internet.\n\n\t
