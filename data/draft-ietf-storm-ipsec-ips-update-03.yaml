abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 3723 specifies IPsec requirements for block storage protocols over
    IP (e.g., iSCSI) based on IPsec v2 (RFC 2401 and related RFCs); those requirements
    have subsequently been applied to remote direct data placement protocols, e.g.,
    RDMAP. This document updates RFC 3723''s IPsec requirements to IPsec v3 (RFC 4301
    and related RFCs) and makes some changes to required algorithms based on developments
    in cryptography since RFC 3723 was published. [RFC Editor: The "Updates:" list
    above has been truncated by xml2rfc. The complete list is - Updates: 3720, 3723,
    3821, 3822, 4018, 4172, 4173, 4174, 5040, 5041, 5042, 5043, 5044, 5045, 5046,
    5047, 5048 (if approved) ]</p>'
