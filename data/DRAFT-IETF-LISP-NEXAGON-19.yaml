abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the use of H3 and LISP for Geolocation\n
    \  Services. Geolocation Services utilize geospatial data for:\n   Fresh HDMaps,
    Intelligent Driving, Cruise and Parking assists.\n   Geospatial utilization is
    delivered using in-network compute for\n   brokered verification, curation, and
    localization of data, using:\n\n   - EID addressable geospatial-tiles abstraction
    of road-segments.\n   - EID Interface for detections and uploads to the tile-contexts.\n
    \  - EID Routing-Sharing hazards, blockages, parking, road-inventory.\n   - EID
    themed multicast channels per tile to subscribed clients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
