abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides environment security requirements for
    the I2RS\n   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent
    of\n   the protocol used for I2RS.  As a result, the requirements provided\n   in
    this document are intended to provide good security practise so\n   I2RS can be
    securely deployed and operated.\n\n   These security requirements are designated
    as environment security\n   requirements as opposed to the protocol security requirements\n
    \  described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].  The\n   reason
    to have separate document is that protocol security\n   requirements are intended
    to help the design of the I2RS protocol\n   whether the environment requirements
    are rather intended for\n   deployment or implementations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
