abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes remote checksum offload for encapsulation,\n
    \  which is a mechanism that provides checksum offload of encapsulated\n   packets
    using rudimentary offload capabilities found in most Network\n   Interface Card
    (NIC) devices. The outer header checksum e.g. that in\n   UDP or GRE) is enabled
    in packets and, with some additional meta\n   information, a receiver is able
    to deduce the checksum to be set for\n   an inner encapsulated packet. Effectively
    this offloads the\n   computation of the inner checksum. Enabling the outer checksum
    in\n   encapsulation has the additional advantage that it covers more of the\n
    \  packet than the inner checksum including the encapsulation headers.\n\n\t </p>\n
