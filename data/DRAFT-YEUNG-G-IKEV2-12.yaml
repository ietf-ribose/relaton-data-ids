abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new group key distribution protocol.
    \ The\n   protocol is in conformance with MSEC key management architecture it\n
    \  contains two components: member registration and group rekeying, both\n   downloading
    group security associations from the Group Controller/Key\n   Server to a member
    of the group.  The new protocol is similar to\n   IKEv2 in message and payload
    formats as well as message semantics.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
