abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this draft we consider dynamic multipath routing and introduce
    two\n   methods that use additive increase and multiplicative decrease for\n   flow
    control, similar to TCP.  Our first method allows for congestion\n   control and
    re-routing flows as users join in or leave the network.\n   As the number of applications
    and services supported by the Internet\n   grows, bandwidth requirements increase
    dramatically so it is\n   imperative to design methods to ensure not only that
    network\n   throughput is maximized but also to ensure a level of fairness in\n
    \  network resource allocation.  Our second method provides fairness\n   over
    multiple streams of traffic.  We drive the multiplicative\n   decrease part of
    the algorithm with link queue occupancy data\n   provided by an enhanced routing
    protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
