abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the integration of the Network Service
    Header\n   (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to\n
    \  support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while\n   maintaining
    separation of the service and transport planes as\n   originally intended by the
    SFC architecture.\n\n   Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for
    steering\n   packets between Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given\n
    \  Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH has the responsibility for\n   maintaining
    the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance\n   context, and any associated
    metadata.\n\n   This integration demonstrates that NSH and SR can work cooperatively\n
    \  and provide a network operator with the flexibility to use whichever\n   transport
    technology makes sense in specific areas of their network\n   infrastructure while
    still maintaining an end-to-end service plane\n   using NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
