abstract:
  content: "<p>Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correctoperation
    of an email system. However, the existing Draft Standards(RFC 3461, RFC 3462,
    RFC 3464) are presently limited to US-ASCII textin the machine-readable portions
    of the protocol. This specificationadds a new address type for international email
    addresses so anoriginal recipient address with non-US-ASCII characters can becorrectly
    preserved even after downgrading. This also providesupdated content return media
    types for delivery status notificationsand message disposition notifications to
    support use of the newaddress type.This document experimentally extends RFC 3461,
    RFC 3464, and RFC3798.</p>"
