abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to
    roam\nand attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing
    sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending\nthe Mobile IPv6 support
    to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are\nnot required to support any kind
    of mobility, since packets must go\nthrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA)
    bi-directional tunnel.\nCommunications from/to a mobile network have to traverse
    the Home\nAgent, and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally,\nthis
    solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.\n\nThis document describes
    an approach to the Route Optimisation for\nNEMO, based on the well-known concept
    of Correspondent Router.  The\nsolution aims at meeting the currently identified
    NEMO Route\nOptimisation requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and\nSpace
    Exploration.  Based on the ideas that have been proposed in the\npast, as well
    as some other extensions, this document describes a\nCorrespondent Router based
    solution, trying to identify the most\nimportant open issues.\n\nThe main goal
    of this first version of the document is to describe an\ninitial NEMO RO solution
    based on the deployment of Correspondent\nRouters and trigger the discussion within
    the MEXT WG about this kind\nof solution.\n\nThis document (in an appendix) also
    analyses how a Correspondent\nRouter based solution fits each of the currently
    identified NEMO\nRoute Optimisation requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics\nand
    Space Exploration.\n\t </p>\n      "
