abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all
    kinds\n   of information including resources, services and data. With many\n   proposals
    of novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA, ICN\n   NDN, the location-based
    routing starts to transfer to the content\n   based ones. Currently, it is incompatible
    that many different\n   information naming schemes are adopted in different network\n
    \  proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names\n   in
    NDN. The proposed naming scheme using a hybrid naming structure,\n   including
    hierarchical components, and the properties of the\n   component assembly plane.
    The hybrid naming (hn) scheme enables to\n   identify different routing information
    uniformly, and provides many\n   great advantages, such as high aggregation, limited
    length, suffix\n   holes remission, fuzzy matching support, high security and
    good\n   compatibility with IPv4/IPv6, DONA, CCN/NDN and so on.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
