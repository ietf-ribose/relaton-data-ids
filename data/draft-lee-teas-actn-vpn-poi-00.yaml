abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the applicability of Abstraction and Control
    of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to VPN with the integration of Packet and
    Optical Networks (POI). It also identifies a number of scenarios where the integration
    of packet and optical networks is necessary to support VPN service requirements.
    The role of optical underlay tunnels in the POI is to support certain applications
    that require a hard isolation with strict deterministic latency and guaranteed
    constant bandwidth.</p>"
