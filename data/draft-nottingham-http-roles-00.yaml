abstract:
- content: "<p>Web servers are becoming more complex, and as a result are losing the
    full benefits of HTTP protocol compliance. This applicability statement defines
    classifications of Web server sub-components and clarifies their responsibilities
    in implementing HTTP/1.1 protocol features, with a discussion of the motivations
    for doing so.</p>"
