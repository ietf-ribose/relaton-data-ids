abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861 going back to RFC 1970) was
    defined\n   at a time when link-local multicast was as reliable and with the same\n
    \  network cost (send a packet on a yellow-coax Ethernet) as unicast and\n   where
    the hosts were assumed to be always on and connected.\n\n   Since 1996 we've seen
    a significant change with both an introduction\n   of wireless networks and battery
    operated devices, which poses\n   significant challenges for the old assumptions.
    \ We are also seeing\n   datacenter networks where virtual machines are not always
    on and\n   connected, and scaling of multicast can be challenging.\n\n   This
    specification contains extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   which remove
    most use of multicast and make sleeping hosts more\n   efficient.  The specification
    includes a default mixed mode where a\n   link can have an arbitrary mix of hosts
    and/or routers - some\n   implementing legacy Neighbor Discovery and some implementing
    the\n   optimizations in this specification.  The optimizations provide\n   incremental
    benefits to hosts as soon as the first updated routers\n   are deployed on a link.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
