abstract:
  content: "<p>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been that thetransition
    to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and thatmost things would be converted
    this way before we ran out of IPv4.It has not happened. The IANA free pool of
    IPv4 addresses will bedepleted soon, way before any significant IPv6 deployment
    will haveoccurred.This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the
    dual-stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the cost and thebenefits of
    deploying IPv6. It will provide the necessary bridgebetween the two protocols,
    offering an evolution path of the Internetpost IANA IPv4 depletion.</p>"
