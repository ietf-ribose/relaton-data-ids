abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mapping of addresses to names is a feature of DNS.  Many sites\nimplement
    it, many others do not.  Some applications attempt to use\nit as a part of a security
    strategy.  This document outlines what\nshould be taken into account when deciding
    whether to implement\nreverse mappings of addresses to names, suggests that site\nadministrators
    implement reverse mappings if there are no strong\nconsiderations against such
    mappings, and provides considerations to\nbe taken into account when using reverse
    mappings.\n\t </p>\n      "
