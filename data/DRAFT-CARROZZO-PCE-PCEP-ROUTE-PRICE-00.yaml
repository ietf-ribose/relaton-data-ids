abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The PCE defined in RFC4655 is a functional entity generally
    confined\n   in the control plane to elaborate explicit optimal routes with\n
    \  related costs to be installed as [G]MPLS tunnels/LSPs.  The resulting\n   route
    cost(s)/metric(s) are Traffic Engineering indicators used by\n   the network administrator
    (carrier) to optimize the usage of its\n   network resources.\n\n   In this document
    a framework for the usage of PCE in cooperation with\n   the Network Service and
    Business Plane (NSBP) is proposed, along with\n   related PCEP extensions.  The
    NSBP invokes this extended PCE (service\n   PCE) to trigger the computation of
    network service offers with\n   related price information.  The price of a network
    connectivity\n   service generally depends on strategic factors, but it could
    also be\n   influenced by the amount of mobilized network resources (along the\n
    \  route), the ingress/egress interfaces/PoPs, etc.  Therefore, it could\n   be
    provided by an extended service-PCE as an additional route\n   information.\n\n
    \  This document focuses on the extensions to the PCEP protocol in\n   support
    of the computation of route prices for intra- and inter-\n   domain network connectivity
    services.  Mechanisms for elaborating and\n   retrieving price information in
    the PCE are vendor-specific and out\n   of the scope of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n
