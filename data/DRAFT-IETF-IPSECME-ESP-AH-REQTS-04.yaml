abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to
    the\n   Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH;\n
    \  it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these\n   algorithms.\n\n
    \  The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header\n   (AH)
    protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to\n   provide confidentiality
    and/or data origin authentication to\n   protected data communications in the
    IP Security (IPsec)\n   architecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate\n
    \  implementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-\n   implement
    algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of\n   mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies\n   algorithms that should be implemented
    because they may be promoted to\n   mandatory at some future time, and also recommends
    against the\n   implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is
    also\n   provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security\n
    \  goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n
