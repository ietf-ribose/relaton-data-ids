abstract:
- content: <p>This draft presents use cases from diverse industries which have in
    common a need for "deterministic flows". "Deterministic" in this context means
    that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties
    germane to the transport of time- sensitive data. These use cases differ notably
    in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group
    broad industry context for DetNet. For each use case, this document will identify
    the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential
    improvements that DetNet can enable. The Use Case Common Themes section then extracts
    and enumerates the set of common properties implied by these use cases.</p>
