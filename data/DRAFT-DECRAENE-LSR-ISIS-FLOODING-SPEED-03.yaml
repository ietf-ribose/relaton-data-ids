abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a mechanism that can be used to increase
    the\n   speed at which link state information is exchanged between two\n   routers
    when multiple LSPs need to be flooded, such as in case of a\n   node failure.
    \ It also reduces the likelihood of overloading the\n   router receiving the LSPs.
    \ This document defines a new TLV to be\n   advertised in SNP and or Hello messages.
    \ This TLV may carry a set of\n   parameters indicating the performance capacity
    to receive LSPs: the\n   number of LSPs which can the received back to back, the
    minimum delay\n   between further two consecutive LSPs and the minimum delay before\n
    \  retransmission of an LSP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
