abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia\n
    \  streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed\n   to
    improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things\n   streams.
    \ Usually, real-time applications such as virtual reality\n   generate a user-controlled
    multimedia streaming.  This is a time-\n   continuous data flux that could be
    divided spatially or temporally to\n   distribute processing, memory or network
    resources.  This protocol\n   does not describe streaming communication, but the
    control of each\n   single streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes
    or things.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
