abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines an extensible metadata member that may be
    inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to process those responses.
    It is expressed as a member called "_links" that is inserted as the top level
    member in the responses. It will allow the client to learn where the members in
    the response could be used and how, etc. Since it is just a member, any client
    that does not understand this extension should not break and work normally while
    supporting clients can utilize the metadata to its advantage.</p>
