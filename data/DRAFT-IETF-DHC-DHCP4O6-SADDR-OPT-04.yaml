abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (RFC7341) is a mechanism for dynamically\n
    \  configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6\n   to
    function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and\n   deployment scenarios,
    the operator needs to know the IPv6 address\n   that the client will use as the
    source of IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire\n   tunnel.  This address, in conjunction with
    the client's IPv4 address,\n   and (in some deployments) the Port Set ID are used
    to create a\n   binding table entry in the operator's softwire tunnel concentrator.\n
    \  This memo defines a DHCPv6 option to convey IPv6 parameters for\n   establishing
    the softwire tunnel and a DHCPv4 option (to be used only\n   with DHCP 4o6) to
    communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address between\n   the DHCP 4o6 client and
    server.  It is designed to work in\n   conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation
    process.\n\n   This document updates \"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire\n
    \  Address and Port-Mapped Clients\" (RFC7598), allowing OPTION_S46_BR\n   (90)
    to be enumerated in the DHCPv6 client's ORO request and appear\n   directly within
    subsequent messages sent by the DHCPv6 server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
