abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP has been used as an underlay routing protocol in many hyper-scale
    data centers. This document proposes a BGP neighbor autodiscovery mechanism which
    can be used to simplify the BGP deployment greatly. This mechanism is very useful
    for those hyper-scale data centers where BGP is used as an underlay routing protocol.</p>"
