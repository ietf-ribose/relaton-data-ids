abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding
    and\n   routing processes is policy-based.  As such, no maximum length must\n
    \  be assumed by design.\n\n   Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing
    revealed a need\n   for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding\n
    \  decision-making processes.  This document sketches a recommendation\n   to
    be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the\n   prefix length.
    \ The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding\n   designs that exclude
    some IP prefix lengths.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
