abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. Segment routing (SR) leverages
    the source routing and tunneling paradigms. The Stateful PCEP extensions allow
    stateful control of Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (TE) Paths. Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing SR TE paths in the network. This document defines
    PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional SR Paths (one in each direction
    in the network) into a single associated bidirectional SR Path. The mechanisms
    defined in this document can also be applied using a stateful PCE for both PCE-
    initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs or when using a stateless PCE.</p>"
