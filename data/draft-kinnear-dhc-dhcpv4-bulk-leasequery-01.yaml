abstract:
  content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has beenextended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor torequest information about
    DHCPv4 bindings. That mechanism is limitedto queries for individual bindings.
    In some situations individualbinding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.
    Thisdocument expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery protocol to allow for bulktransfer
    of DHCPv4 address binding data via TCP.</p>"
