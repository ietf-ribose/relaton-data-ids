abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Most CPEs should soon be dual stack, but a large installed base
    of\nIPv4-only CPEs is likely to remain for several years.  Also, with the\nIPv4
    address shortage, more and more ISPs will assign private IPv4\naddresses to their
    customers.  The need for IPv6 connectivity\ntherefore concerns hosts behind IPv4-only
    CPEs, including such CPEs\nthat are assigned private addresses.  The 6a44 mechanism
    specified in\nthis document addresses this need, without limitations and\noperational
    complexities of Tunnel Brokers and Teredo to do the same.\n\n6a44 is based on
    an address mapping and on a mechanism whereby\nsuitably upgraded hosts behind
    a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity via\na stateless 6a44 server function operated
    by their Internet Service\nProvider.  With it, IPv6 traffic between two 6a44 hosts
    in a single\nsite remains within the site.  Except for IANA numbers that remain
    to\nbe assigned, the specification is intended to be complete enough for\nrunning
    codes to be independently written and interwork.\n\t </p>\n      "
