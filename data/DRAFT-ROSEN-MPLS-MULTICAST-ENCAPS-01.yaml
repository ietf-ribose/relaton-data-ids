abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 3032 established two data link layer codepoints for MPLS:
    one to\n   indicate that the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS unicast\n
    \  packet, and the other to indicate that the data link layer frame is\n   carrying
    an MPLS multicast packet.  This specification updates\n   RFC3032 by redefining
    the meaning of these two codepoints.  The\n   former \"multicast codepoint\" is
    now to be used only on multiaccess\n   media, and it is to mean \"the top label
    of the following label stack\n   is an upstream-assigned label\".  The former
    \"unicast codepoint\" is to\n   be used in all other cases.  Whether the data
    link layer payload is a\n   unicast MPLS packet or a multicast MPLS packet is
    now to be\n   determined by looking up the top label, rather than by the codepoint.\n\n
    \  RFC3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the\n   \"MAC
    DA\" field of an ethernet frame which carries an MPLS multicast\n   packet.  This
    document provides that specification.\n\n   This document updates RFC 3032 and
    RFC 4023.\n\t </p>\n      "
