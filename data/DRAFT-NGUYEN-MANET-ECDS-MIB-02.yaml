abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the\n   Essential
    Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS) process for Mobile Ad-Hoc\n   Networks (MANETs).
    \ The ECDS-MIB also reports state information,\n   performance metrics, and notifications.
    \ In addition to\n   configuration, the additional state and performance information
    is\n   useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
