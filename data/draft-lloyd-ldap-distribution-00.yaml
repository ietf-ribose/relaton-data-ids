abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines chaining arguments that can be applied to
    anyLDAP operation for distributed/chained server to server operations.This approach
    to distribution for LDAP systems, enables a consistenttransition of the LDAP single
    server environments, to the fullfunctionality of X.500 distributed directory systems.
    This proposalis supported by two other proposals previously submitted as&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt;
    and &lt;draft-lloyd-list-read-00.txt&gt;.These proposals require that LDAP V3
    is evolved to LDAP V4. LDAP V4will enable LDAP clients and servers that access
    and interwork withX.500 systems, to more readily use (and integrate with) the
    fulldistribution and replication services offered by X.500. In additionthis approach
    will provide better compatability with the higherfunctionality afforded to X.500
    DAP clients.(Although the commonly known information restrictions of LDAP stringencoding
    may still apply). The Chaining controls proposed in this draft will be carried
    with theoriginal LDAP access client controls as defined in&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt;
    in the standard LDAP V4 operations(Search, List, etc) when it is used for server
    - server communication.ie. chaining.</p>"
