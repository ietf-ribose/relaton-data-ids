abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy\n
    \  implications of different types of \"transient numeric identifiers\"\n   used
    in IETF protocols, and tries to categorize them based on their\n   interoperability
    requirements and their associated failure severity\n   when such requirements
    are not met.  Subsequently, it provides advice\n   on possible algorithms that
    could be employed to satisfy the\n   interoperability requirements of each identifier
    category, while\n   minimizing the negative security and privacy implications,
    thus\n   providing guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.\n
    \  Finally, it describes a number of algorithms that have been employed\n   in
    real implementations to generate transient numeric identifiers,\n   and analyzes
    their security and privacy properties.  This document is\n   a product of the
    Privacy Enhancement and Assessment Research Group\n   (PEARG) in the IRTF.\n\n\t
