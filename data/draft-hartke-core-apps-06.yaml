abstract:
- content: "<p>The interfaces of RESTful, hypermedia-driven Web applications consist
    of reusable components such as Internet media types and link relation types. This
    document proposes CoRE Application Descriptions, a convention for application
    designers to describe the programmable interface of their Web application in a
    structured way so that other parties can easily develop interoperable clients
    and servers or reuse the components in their own applications.</p>"
