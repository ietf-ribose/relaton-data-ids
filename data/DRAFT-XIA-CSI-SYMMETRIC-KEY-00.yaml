abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from
    the\nrouter to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND)\nsignaling
    between the router and the host.  The host sends a Router\nSolicitation(RS) message
    with ND Shared Key Request Option to the\nrouter.  The router encrypts a ND shared
    key using the host's SEcure\nNeighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it
    back to the host\nthrough a Router Advertisement(RA) message.  The host decrypts
    the ND\nshared key using the matching private key.  The Neighbor Discovery\nshared
    key is then used for protecting the following Neighbor\nDiscovery signaling between
    the router and the host.  The Router\nSolicitation and Router Advertisement message
    exchanges are required\nto have SEND security.\n\t </p>\n      "
