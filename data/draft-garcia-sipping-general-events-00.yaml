abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP event notification framework is specified in RFC 3265. The
    framework restricts usage to notifications of events related to the SIP state.
    However, there is growing interest in the community for relaxing that constraint
    and using the SIP event notification framework for reporting changes in state
    that is not directly related to SIP. For example, it has been suggested a usage
    of the framework for reporting events related to a vehicle state, files stored
    in a device, calendar events, and Sieve notifications. This memo discusses the
    benefits of a mechanism for general event notifications using SIP.</p>"
