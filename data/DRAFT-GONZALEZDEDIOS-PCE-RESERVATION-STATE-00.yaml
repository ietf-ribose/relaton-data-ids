abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\nfunctions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label\nSwitching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\nA limited form of statefulness is useful
    to improve PCE functionality\nin situations in which the local TED might not be
    up to date, or in\nthe case of concurrent requests where most of the LSPs are
    computed\nbefore the end of the set-up of the LSPs when the TED is updated.\nThe
    PCE can retain some context from the resources assigned to Path\nRequests during
    a certain period of time, so that it avoids\nsuggesting the use of the same resources
    for subsequent TE LSPs.\n\nThis document proposes an extension to the PCEP protocol
    to allow the\nPCC to request the PCE to block or reserve the resources computed
    in\na path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for a certain\ntime.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
