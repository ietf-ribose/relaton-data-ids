abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the limitations of TCP is that it has limited space for TCP
    options, only 40 bytes. Many mechanisms have been proposed for for extending the
    TCP option space, but the biggest challenge has been to get additional option
    space in the initial SYN packet. This memo presents a optional four-way TCP handshake
    to allow extended option space to be used in SYN packets in both directions.</p>"
