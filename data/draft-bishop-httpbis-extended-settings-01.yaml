abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/2 defines the SETTINGS frame to contain a single 32-bit value
    per setting. While this is sufficient to convey everything used in the core HTTP/2
    specification, some protocols will require more complex values, such as arrays
    of code-points or strings. For such protocols, this extension defines a parallel
    to the SETTINGS frame, EXTENDED_SETTINGS, where the value of a setting is not
    a 32-bit value, but a variable-length opaque data blob whose interpretation is
    subject entirely to the definition of the protocol using it.</p>"
