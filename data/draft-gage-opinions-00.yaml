abstract:
  content: "<p>This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications inan
    IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise currentconcepts of mobility,
    there is an industry need to support similarfunctions in non-cellular environments
    as well. Unfortunately,solutions defined to-date by the cellular industry tend
    to beclosely tied to the technology employed over the radio link (e.g.GSM, cdma2000,
    UMTS, EDGE).To facilitate discussion, this document begins with a high-leveldescription
    of functional entities comprising an Open IP NetworkInfrastructure. It then defines
    an abstract model of the access linkused to connect a mobile host to the network.
    Using these entitiesand model, we then go on to discuss the issues facing nomadiccomputing
    that could be usefully addressed by an IETF working grouplike CRAPS.</p>"
