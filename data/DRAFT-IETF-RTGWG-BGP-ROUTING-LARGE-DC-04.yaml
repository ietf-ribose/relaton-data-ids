abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some network operators build and operate data centers that
    support\n   over one hundred thousand servers.  In this document, such data\n
    \  centers are referred to as \"large-scale\" to differentiate them from\n   smaller
    infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique\n   set of network
    requirements with an emphasis on operational\n   simplicity and network stability.
    \ This document summarizes\n   operational experience in designing and operating
    large-scale data\n   centers using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent
    is to\n   report on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged\n
    \  by others in the industry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
