abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The XML Patch media type \"application/xml-patch+xml\" defines
    an XML\n   document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that\n
    \  are applied to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format's\n   foundations
    are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a\n   document format and
    a media type registration, so that XML Patch\n   documents can be labeled with
    a media type, for example in HTTP\n   conversations.\n\n   In addition to the
    media type registration, this specification also\n   updates RFC 5261 in some
    aspects, limiting these updates to cases\n   where RFC 5261 needed to be fixed,
    or was hard to understand.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
