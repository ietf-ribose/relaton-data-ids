abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A BGP speaker may perform RPKI origin validation not only on
    routes\n   received from BGP neighbors and routes that are redistributed from\n
    \  other routing protocols, but also on routes it sends to BGP\n   neighbors.
    \ For egress policy, it is important that the\n   classification uses the 'effective
    origin AS' of the processed route,\n   which may specifically be altered by the
    commonly available knobs\n   such as removing private ASs, confederation handling,
    and other\n   modifications of the origin AS.  This document updates [RFC6811].\n\n\n\t
