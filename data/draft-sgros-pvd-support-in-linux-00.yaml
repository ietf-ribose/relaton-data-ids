abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations which
    implemented parts of PvD architecture document. One implementation was done from
    scratch (PvD-manager) while another is a part of an existing component (NetworkManager).
    The implementation of server component was also done but only in IPv6 router.
    DHCP was ignored due to IPR claims.</p>"
