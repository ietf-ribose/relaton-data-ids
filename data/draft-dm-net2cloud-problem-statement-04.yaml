abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems of enterprises face today in connecting
    their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third party data centers (a.k.a.
    Cloud DCs). It examines some of the approaches for interconnecting workloads &amp;
    applications hosted in cloud DCs with enterprises' on-premises DCs &amp; branch
    offices. This document also describes some of the (network) problems that many
    enterprises face when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split
    among hybrid data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple sites
    that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and leased lines.
    Current operational problems in the field are examined to determine whether there
    is a need for enhancements to existing protocols or whether a new protocol is
    necessary to solve them.</p>"
