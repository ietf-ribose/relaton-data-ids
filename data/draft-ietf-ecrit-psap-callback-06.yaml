abstract:
- content: "<p>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
    by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible that the
    call taker feels the need for further communication. For example, the call may
    have been dropped by accident without the call taker having sufficient information
    about the current situation of a wounded person. A call taker may trigger a callback
    towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial
    emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like
    any other call and as a consequence it may get blocked by authorization policies
    or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture
    specification already offers a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to
    bypass authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary delays.
    Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios. This document
    discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios
    where better-than- normal call treatment behavior would be desirable. Note that
    this version of the document does not yet specify a solution due to the lack of
    the working group participants agreeing on the requirements.</p>"
