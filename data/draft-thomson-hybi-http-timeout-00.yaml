abstract:
- content: "<p>A Request-Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP). This end-to-end header informs an origin server and any intermediaries
    of the maximum time that a client will await a response to its request. A server
    can use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated. This also identifies
    requests as being potentially long-lived, and allows for better resource allocation
    for these requests. A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hop
    header informs the entity at the other end of a connection of the maximum time
    that an idle connection is kept open. This header improves reliability by providing
    better information about the idle connection management policy of HTTP hosts.</p>"
