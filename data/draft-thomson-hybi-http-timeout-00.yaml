abstract:
  content: "<p>A Request-Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP).
    This end-to-end header informs an origin server and anyintermediaries of the maximum
    time that a client will await aresponse to its request. A server can use this
    header to ensure thata timely response is generated. This also identifies requests
    asbeing potentially long-lived, and allows for better resourceallocation for these
    requests.A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hopheader
    informs the entity at the other end of a connection of themaximum time that an
    idle connection is kept open. This headerimproves reliability by providing better
    information about the idleconnection management policy of HTTP hosts.</p>"
