abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the development of novel network technology, such as software\n
    \  defined networking and network function virtualization, many novel\n   multi-domain
    applications, such as flexible interdomain routing,\n   distributed, federated
    machine learning and multi-domain\n   collaborative dataset transfer, have been
    deployed.  These\n   applications can benefit substantially from the ALTO protocol\n
    \  [RFC7285], through which the information of multiple networks can be\n   provided
    to applications.  This document first introduces several\n   multi-domain applications
    and how they can benefit from ALTO.  It\n   then describes a generic framework
    for multi-domain applications to\n   use ALTO to improve the performance, followed
    by a discussion on new\n   requirements and challenges for ALTO to better support
    these\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
