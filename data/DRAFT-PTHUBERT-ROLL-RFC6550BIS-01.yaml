abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network
    in which\n   both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers\n
    \  typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and\n   energy
    (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by\n   high loss rates,
    low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised\n   of anything from a few
    dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported\n   traffic flows include point-to-point
    (between devices inside the\n   LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control
    point to a subset\n   of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from
    devices\n   inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document\n
    \  specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks\n   (RPL),
    which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic\n   from devices
    inside the LLN towards a central control point as well\n   as point-to-multipoint
    traffic from the central control point to the\n   devices inside the LLN are supported.
    \ Support for point-to-point\n   traffic is also available.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
