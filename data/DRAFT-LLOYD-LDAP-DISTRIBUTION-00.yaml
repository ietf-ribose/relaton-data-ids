abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines chaining arguments that can be applied to
    any\nLDAP operation for distributed/chained server to server operations.\nThis
    approach to distribution for LDAP systems, enables a consistent\ntransition of
    the LDAP single server environments, to the full\nfunctionality of X.500 distributed
    directory systems. This proposal\nis supported by two other proposals previously
    submitted as\n&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; and &lt;draft-lloyd-list-read-00.txt&gt;.\nThese
    proposals require that LDAP V3 is evolved to LDAP V4. LDAP V4\nwill enable LDAP
    clients and servers that access and interwork with\nX.500 systems, to more readily
    use (and integrate with) the full\ndistribution and replication services offered
    by X.500. In addition\nthis approach will provide better compatability with the
    higher\nfunctionality afforded to X.500 DAP clients.\n(Although the commonly known
    information restrictions of LDAP string\nencoding may still apply).\n \nThe Chaining
    controls proposed in this draft will be carried with the\noriginal LDAP access
    client controls as defined in\n&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; in the standard
    LDAP V4 operations\n(Search, List, etc) when it is used for server - server communication.\nie.
    chaining.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
