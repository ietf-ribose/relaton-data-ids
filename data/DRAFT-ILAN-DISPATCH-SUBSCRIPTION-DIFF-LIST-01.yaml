abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   SIP SIMPLE work group has defined several improvements to SIP\n
    \  Presence event notification model, such as subscription to a list of\n   resources
    in the body of single SUBSCRIBE request, and Resource List\n   Server (RLS) to
    create subscription to resource list identified by a\n   URI. This document presents
    an extension to incrementally update\n   resource list contained in the body of
    subscription requests for SIP\n   presence. The document defines semantics for
    creating incremental\n   changes to resource list that are carried in requests
    for\n   subscription refreshes. This enables reduction in the number of\n   messages
    exchanged for subscriptions in large network of inter-\n   connected SIP based
    presence servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
