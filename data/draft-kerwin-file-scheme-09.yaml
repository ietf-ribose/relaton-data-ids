abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738. The purpose of this document
    is to keep the information about the scheme on standards track, since RFC 1738
    has been made obsolete, and to promote interoperability by resolving disagreements
    between various implementations. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed
    on its github project page [github].</p>"
