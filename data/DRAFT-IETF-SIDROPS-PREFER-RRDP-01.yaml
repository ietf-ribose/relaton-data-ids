abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a
    state\n   where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI\n
    \  Validation will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)\n   [RFC8182]
    as the preferred access protocol, and require rsync as a\n   fallback option only.\n\n
    \  In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not\n   all
    Repositories, and most but not all RP software.\n\n   In the proposed phase 1
    RRDP will become mandatory to implement for\n   Repositories, in addition to rsync.
    \ This phase can start as soon as\n   this document is published.\n\n   Phase
    2 will start once the proposed updates are implemented by all\n   compliant Repositories.
    \ In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to\n   implement for all compliant
    RP software, and rsync will be required\n   as a fallback option only.\n\n   It
    should be noted that although this document currently includes\n   descriptions
    and updates to RFCs for each of these phases, we may\n   find that it will be
    beneficial to have one or more separate\n   documents for these phases, so that
    it might be more clear to all\n   when the updates to RFCs take effect.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
