abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a collection of technical clarifications to the DNS
    Security (DNSSEC) document set. It is meant to serve as a resource to implementors
    as well as a collection of DNSSEC errata that existed at the time of writing.
    This document updates the core DNSSEC documents (RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035)
    as well as the NSEC3 specification (RFC 5155). It also defines NSEC3 and SHA-2
    (RFC 4509 and RFC 5702) as core parts of the DNSSEC specification.</p>"
