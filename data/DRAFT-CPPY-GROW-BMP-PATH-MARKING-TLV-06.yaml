abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for
    obtaining\n   BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP\n
    \  Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension\n   to
    BMP to convey the status of a BGP path before and after being\n   processed by
    the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension\n   makes use of the TLV
    mechanims described in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv\n   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and
    draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit\n   [I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].\n\n\n\t </p>\n
