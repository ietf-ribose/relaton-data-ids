abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Spine-Leaf topology adopts the Intermediate System to\n
    \  Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol, the Leaf node receives\n   Link
    State Packets (LSPs) from all the other nodes thus having the\n   entire routing
    information of the topology.  This is usually\n   considered unnecessary and costly.
    \ This document describes a\n   solution to this problem by utilizing IS-IS's
    inherent multi-level\n   and area partition features, which requires that an IS-IS
    router\n   SHOULD check a level-1 LSP's area addresses before advertising it to\n
    \  a neighbor.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
