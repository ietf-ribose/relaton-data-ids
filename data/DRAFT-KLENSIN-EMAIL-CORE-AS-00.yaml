abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications
    that is\n   still in very active use.  While the basic protocols and formats for\n
    \  mail transport and message formats have evolved slowly over the\n   years,
    events and thinking in more recent years have supplemented\n   those core protocols
    with additional features and suggestions for\n   their use.  This Applicability
    Statement describes the relationship\n   among many of those protocols and provides
    guidance and makes\n   recommendations for the use of features of the core protocols.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
