abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Static Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks cannot make full
    use of\n   standard IPv4 or IPv6 static routing as defined in section 7.4 of\n
    \  [RFC1812], due to the DTN feature of Late Binding where the IP\n   address
    or addresses associated with an Endpoint Identifier may not\n   be known when
    a packet is originated.  This draft presents a\n   specification for static routing
    in the DTN environment.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
