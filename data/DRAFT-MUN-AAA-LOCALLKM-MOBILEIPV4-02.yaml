abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Isolating the access to mobility agents by the VPN gateway
    which\n   guards the home agent, home resources is disturbing the operations\n
    \  of mobile node away from its home that needed to perform the\n   registration
    of the current location according to the specification\n   because the access
    from the outside is restricted by the VPN policy.\n   This paper presents the
    authentication and key exchange scheme using\n   the AAA infrastructure for a
    user in Internet to access the Intranet\n   behind the VPN gateway. By defining
    the role of authentication and \n   tunnel processing for each agent or relaying
    entity, we are able to \n   obtain our goal to the security-aware environment.
    Also, the \n   performance result of the proposed scheme is discussed in depth.\n\n\t
