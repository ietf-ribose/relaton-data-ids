abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes PCE architecture and protocol in SDN-based\n
    \  transport network. It is demonstrated that PCE can fit in the\n   transport
    SDN architecture and complete corresponding requests. The\n   PCE and its protocol
    can satisfy the functional requirement in\n   several transport SDN applications.\n\n\n\n\n\t
