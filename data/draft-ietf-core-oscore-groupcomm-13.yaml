abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE), providing end-to-end security of CoAP messages exchanged
    between members of a group, e.g., sent over IP multicast. In particular, the described
    approach defines how OSCORE is used in a group communication setting to provide
    source authentication for CoAP group requests, sent by a client to multiple servers,
    and for protection of the corresponding CoAP responses. Group OSCORE also defines
    a pairwise mode where each member of the group can efficiently derive a symmetric
    pairwise key with any other member of the group for pairwise OSCORE communication.</p>"
