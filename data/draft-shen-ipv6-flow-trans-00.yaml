abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interworking scheme.
    Inthis scheme, the underlying mobility support mechanism is required toprovide
    a unique flow identity regardless of node mobility, makingnode mobility transparent
    to flow QoS handling mechanisms. Thus QoSsignaling delay as well as data packet
    delays and losses duringhandoff can be reduced. We also discuss solutions to achieve
    thisscheme which utilizes the new IPv6 flow label. Finally, issuesrelated to security
    and scalability will also be considered.</p>"
