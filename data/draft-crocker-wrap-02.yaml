abstract:
  content: "\t <t>MIME is a general-purpose mechanism for labeling andaggregating
    objects into complex hierarchies. Some MIMEobjects are discrete objects. If placed
    within another MIMEhierarchy, they need to appear as a leaf node in thecontaining
    hierarchy, rather than seeming to be continuationsof that hierarchy. This specification
    defines Content-typeApplication/MIME to provide an encapsulation mechanism forarbitrary
    MIME structures. This facilitates their treatmentas a single unit, rather than
    causing them to be treated aspart of any containing MIME hierarchy.</p>"
