abstract:
- content: "<p>MIME is a general-purpose mechanism for labeling and aggregating objects
    into complex hierarchies. Some MIME objects are discrete objects. If placed within
    another MIME hierarchy, they need to appear as a leaf node in the containing hierarchy,
    rather than seeming to be continuations of that hierarchy. This specification
    defines Content-type Application/MIME to provide an encapsulation mechanism for
    arbitrary MIME structures. This facilitates their treatment as a single unit,
    rather than causing them to be treated as part of any containing MIME hierarchy.</p>"
