abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to use the Password-Based Cryptography
    Specification version 2.1 defined in [RFC8018] to generate password- based keys
    in conjunction with the Russian national standard GOST algorithms. This specification
    is developed outside the IETF and is published to facilitate interoperable implementations
    that wish to support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement
    of the cryptographic algorithms used in this document.</p>"
