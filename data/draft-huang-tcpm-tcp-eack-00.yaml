abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP may experience asymmetric bi-directional performance and poor over
    all performance when acknowledgments (ACKs) are sent by separate packets instead
    of being piggybacked by data packets. Between two TCP end points, when two-way
    traffic flows do not share the same TCP connection, the increase of traffic volume
    in one direction consumes more bandwidth in the reverse direction by generating
    more separate ACK packets, potentially causing more congestions in the reverse
    direction. An Extended Acknowledgment (EACK) mechanism can help overcome these
    limitations. The receiving TCP sends back EACK packets to the sender informing
    the sender of data, including data of the current TCP connection and data of other
    eligible connections, that have been received. EACK thus reduces the need for
    separate ACK packets and improves the bi-directional symmetry and over all throughput.
    This memo proposes an implementation of EACK and discusses its related issues.</p>"
