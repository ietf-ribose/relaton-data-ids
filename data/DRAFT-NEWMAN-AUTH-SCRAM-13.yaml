abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used
    by\nInternet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\npasswords
    over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nThere are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism,\nwhich could be addressed by the use of
    a challenge response\nauthentication mechanism protected by TLS.  Unfortunately,
    the\nchallenge response mechanisms presently on the standards track all\nfail
    to meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment, and\nhave had success
    only in limited use.\n\nThis specification describes a family of Simple Authentication
    and\nSecurity Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the\nSalted
    Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which\naddresses the security
    concerns and meets the deployability\nrequirements.  When used in combination
    with TLS or an equivalent\nsecurity layer, a mechanism from this family could
    improve the\nstatus-quo for application protocol authentication and provide a\nsuitable
    choice for a mandatory-to-implement mechanism for future\napplication protocol
    standards.\n\t </p>\n      "
