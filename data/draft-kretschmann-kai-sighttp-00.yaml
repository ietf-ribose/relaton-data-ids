abstract:
  content: "<p>In case a webserver gets defaced a black hat might change vitalinformation
    with massive danger for the normal surfer. If for example abanking web portal
    site containing a link to the online banking loginscreen gets changed pointing
    to the black hats identical mirror of thelogin screen (as happend here some times
    already) he will get his handson real banking accounts. The encryption via SSL
    of already defaceddata will be no solution at all. SSL is only a counterpart in
    thisscenario to ensure the connected web server is the right one and to dis-able
    data sniffing on the wire.The solution to this case might be signing all HTTP-accessable
    con-tent including static and dynamic HTML pages. This solution even keepsan eye
    on dynamic portal content, as most starting pages now havedynamic content on it,
    starting from the current time to brokerage news.Best solution would never the
    less be to have the critical data withinstatic pages.We can sign any URL based
    content because the signature doesn't getinto the content sent, but into the HTTP
    reply headers. So we don'tmodify any data. The HTTP reply doesn't need any change
    within the web-server source code but can most times be configured by standard
    configu-ration ways.Signing not only HTML but possibly any critical data is needed
    forexample with a flash movie who display critical data like online broker-age
    data. This data might be forged by replacing a lying flash moviewith possibly
    bad consequences to stock rates. One shouldn't underesti-mate the criminal energy
    in these cases.</p>"
