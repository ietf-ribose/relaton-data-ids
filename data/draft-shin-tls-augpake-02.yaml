abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated
    key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in the intended server. In general, the user password
    is chosen from a small set of dictionary whose space is within the off-line dictionary
    attacks. The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against passive attacks,
    active attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages with
    passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server compromise (in
    the context of augmented PAKE security). Based on the AugPAKE protocol, this document
    also specifies a new password-only authentication handshake for Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) protocol.</p>"
