abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an applicability analysis on the use
    of\n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and\n   mechanisms
    to satisfy the requirements of Layer 1 Virtual Private\n   Networks (L1VPNs).\n\n
    \  In addition, this document identifies areas where additional\n   protocol extensions
    or procedures are needed to satisfy the\n   requirements of L1VPNs, and provides
    guidelines for potential\n   extensions.\n\t </p>\n      "
