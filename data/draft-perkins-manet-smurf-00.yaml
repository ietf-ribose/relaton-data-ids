abstract:
- content: "<p>Flooding is useful for many reasons in ad hoc networks, but causes
    congestion that can block traffic. Selecting multi-point relays (MPRs) reduces
    congestion due to flooding, but has several disadvantages. It is possible to select
    a subset of the MPRs to do the same job more effectively. In this document, signaling
    is specified for identifying a relatively small connected dominating set that
    can still manage the flooding operation.</p>"
