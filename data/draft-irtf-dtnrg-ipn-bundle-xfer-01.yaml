abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents an example data transfer in a delay tolerant
    network. The particular delay tolerant network is the Interplanetary Internet,
    and the purpose of this document is to illustrate the key concepts in the Delay
    Tolerant Network architecture [DTNRG03]. The document describes the network and
    follows the progress of a bundle as it is transferred through that network.</p>"
