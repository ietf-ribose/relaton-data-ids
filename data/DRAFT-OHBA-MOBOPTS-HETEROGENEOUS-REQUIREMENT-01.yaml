abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the problem statement and a set of issues
    and\nrequirement specific to heterogeneous handover.  Careful\nconsideration needs
    to be given to these set of requirements while\ndesigning an optimized handover
    framework in a heterogeneous mobility\nscenario.  These problem statements help
    determine the key functions\nthat are responsible for delay during handover involving
    interdomain\nand heterogeneous access technology.  Analysis of these issues and\nrequirements
    can be applied to any existing mobility optimization\nframework.\n\t </p>\n      "
