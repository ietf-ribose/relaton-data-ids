abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conservingglobal
    addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because anIPv4 NAPT router
    implements three functions: source addressselection, next-hop resolution and optionally
    DNS resolution. ForIPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of IPv6 NAT. However,
    NATshould be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent host-to-host connectivity.
    In this document, we analyze the use cases ofmultihoming. We also describe functional
    requirements formultihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small
    IPv6networks that would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6allocation criteria.</p>"
