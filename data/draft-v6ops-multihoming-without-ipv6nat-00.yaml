abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving
    global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an IPv4 NAPT
    router implements three functions: source address selection, next-hop resolution
    and optionally DNS resolution. For IPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of
    IPv6 NAT. However, NAT should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent
    host-to- host connectivity. In this document, we analyze the use cases of multihoming.
    We also describe functional requirements for multihoming without the use of NAT
    in IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet
    minimum IPv6 allocation criteria.</p>"
