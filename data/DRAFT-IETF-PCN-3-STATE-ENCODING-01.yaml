abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect\nthe
    Quality of Service of inelastic flows within a controlled domain.\nIt does this
    by marking packets when traffic load on a link is\napproaching or has exceeded
    a threshold below the physical link rate.\nThis experimental encoding scheme specifies
    how three encoding states\ncan be carried in the IP header using a combination
    of two DSCPs and\nthe ECN bits.  The Basic scheme only allows for three encoding\nstates.
    \ The Full scheme provides 6 states, enough for limited end-\nto-end support for
    ECN as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
