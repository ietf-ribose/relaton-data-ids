abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes a modified TCP Timestamps mechanism called "TS2".
    It uses the existing "TCP Timestamps option" specified in RFC1323 and a new TCP
    option called "the TCP Old Timestamps option", which is specified in this memo.
    As a fallback, an RFC1323-compatible mode called "TS1" is also available. The
    base mechanism of TS2 includes the definitions of those two TCP Timestamps options,
    mode negotiation to enable TS1 or TS2, and a rule for updating internal states.
    The applied mechanisms of TS2 include an accurate RTT measurement mechanism that
    is correct even for duplicate ACK segments (RTTM/TS2), a reordering-robust mechanism
    to detect wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS/TS2), a lightweight mechanism to detect
    spoofed segments (PASA/TS2), a loss inference mechanism applicable to both original
    and retransmitted data segments (DLI/TS2), and a spurious loss inference detection
    mechanism that operates without waiting for one RTT by sending arbitrary in-window
    data (SLID/TS2).</p>
