abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication,\n
    \  Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to\n   rewrite
    the From: header field as a workaround.\n\n   This document describes cases where
    it is possible to revert MLM\n   transformations and hence verify DomainKeys Identified
    Mail (DKIM)\n   signatures that were applied at submission time.  For reliable\n
    \  results, some compliance is required of all agents involved, author\n   domain
    signers, MLMs, forwarders, and final recipients.\n\n   MLM transformation reversion
    reduces the DMARC's effects on indirect\n   mail flows.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
