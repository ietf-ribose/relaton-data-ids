abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Bandwidth consumption of RTP flows can be reduced by tunneling andcompressing
    headers. This draft defines an IP protocol number and aheader which can be used
    to transport IP Header Compressed [IPHC],Compressed RTP [CRTP], and Enhanced Compressed
    RTP [ECRTP] packetsover an arbitrary IP tunnel (IP-in-IP or ESP, for example)
    to reducebandwidth consumption for RTP flows.</p>"
