abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPN) is becoming the de-facto\n
    \  standard-based control plane solution for Data Center and layer-2\n   Service
    Provider applications. The risk of loops caused by backdoor\n   paths accidentally
    created within the same broadcast domain, is a\n   general common concern, especially
    among Service Providers in large\n   Layer-2 networks. While other layer-2 Ethernet
    technologies use\n   Spanning Tree based Protocols (xSTP) to provide a network-wide
    loop\n   protection, EVPN has the right tools to detect and protect the\n   network
    against loops in an efficient and effective way. This\n   document describes a
    mechanism to provide global loop protection in\n   EVPN networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
