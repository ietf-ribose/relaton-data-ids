abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of the blockchain transaction protocol for constraint nodes
    is to enable the generation of blockchain transactions by constraint nodes, according
    to the following principles : - transactions are triggered by Provisioning-Messages
    that include the needed blockchain parameters. - binary encoded transactions are
    returned in Transaction-Messages, which include sensors/actuators data. Constraint
    nodes, associated with blockchain addresses, compute the transaction signature.</p>"
