abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the limitation of sub-optimal routing, reliability and scalability
    problems in the centralized mobility management approach, distributed mobility
    management approaches are developed to resolve those problems. However, the proposed
    distributed mobility management approaches also bring some new problems. This
    document mainly introduces two kinds of approaches classified by the control plane
    management mode and proposes the new problems should be resolved in the future.</p>"
