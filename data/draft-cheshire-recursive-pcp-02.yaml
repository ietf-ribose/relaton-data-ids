abstract:
- content: "<p>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit
    dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their closest on-path NAT, firewall,
    or other middlebox. However, in today's world, there may be more than one NAT
    on the path between a client and the public Internet. This document describes
    how the closest on-path middlebox generates a corresponding upstream PCP request
    to the next closest on-path middlebox, to request an appropriate explicit dynamic
    port mapping in that middlebox too. Applied recursively, this generates the necessary
    chain of port mappings in any number of middleboxes on the path between the client
    and the public Internet.</p>"
