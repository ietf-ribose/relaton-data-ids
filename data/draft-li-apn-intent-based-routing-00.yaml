abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the intent-based routing mechanism through which
    the packet can carry the intent information and the network node can enforce the
    policy according to the intent information (typically steering the packet into
    the SR policy or the underlay slice which can meet the intent). The intent-based
    routing mechanism provides a simple and scalable solution to meet the different
    service requirements for the inter-domain routing.</p>"
