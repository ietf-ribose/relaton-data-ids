abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture for Broadband Network Gateway
    (BNG) devices with control plane (CP) and user plane (UP) separation. A BNG-CP
    is a user control management component while a BNG-UP takes responsibility as
    the network edge and user policy implementation component. Both BNG-CP and BNG-UP
    are core components for fixed broadband services and are deployed separately at
    different network layers.</p>"
