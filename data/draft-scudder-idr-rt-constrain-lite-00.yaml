abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 4684, \"Constrained Route Distribution for Border GatewayProtocol/MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol(IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)\"
    provides a powerful and generalmeans for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate
    Route Targetreachability information which is used for cooperative routefiltering.
    However, the complexity of implementing the entirespecification may have impeded
    its widespread deployment. Thisdocument specifies the subset of functionality
    which is required fora provider edge router (\"PE\") to originate Route Target
    NLRI. SuchPEs need not implement any filtering functionality.</p>"
