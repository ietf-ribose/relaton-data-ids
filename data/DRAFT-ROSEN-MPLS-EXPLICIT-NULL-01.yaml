abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 3032 defines a reserved label value known as 'IPv4 Explicit
    NULL'\nand a reserved label value known as 'IPv6 Explicit NULL'.  It states\nthat
    these label values are only legal at the bottom of the MPLS\nlabel stack.  This
    restriction is now removed, so that those label\nvalues are legal anywhere in
    the stack.\n\t </p>\n      "
