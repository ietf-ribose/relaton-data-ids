abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are
    common in\n   today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this\n
    \  draft suggests use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service nodes\n   for
    such flows. The benefit of this approach would be to avoid\n   expensive Layer
    7 service node processing for such flows based on\n   dynamic decisions and improve
    overall performance.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
