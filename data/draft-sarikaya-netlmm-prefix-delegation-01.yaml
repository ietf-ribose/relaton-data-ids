abstract:
  content: "<p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to oneinterface
    of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) anddifferent mobile nodes
    can not share this home network prefix.Managing per-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely toincrease the processing load at the LMA. Based on the idea
    thatDynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers canmanage prefixes,
    we propose a new technique in which LMA offloadsdelegation and release tasks of
    the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server.LMA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile
    node to the DHCPv6server. Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a homeaddress
    for its interface. When the mobile station leaves thenetwork, the prefix is returned
    to the DHCPv6 server.Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
    can alsoplay a role in prefix delegation.</p>"
