abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables and permits
    endpoints\n   in an INVITE transaction to send media packets before an SDP offer/\n
    \  answer exchange has completed; we refer to such media packets as\n   early
    media.  The use of early media is common in current SIP\n   implementations, and
    causes several problems, which have been\n   documented elsewhere.  This document
    puts forward the goal of\n   modifying SIP so that compliant implementations will
    complete an SDP\n   exchange before sending media, and lays out high-level requirements\n
    \  for such a solution.  The set of possible solutions is then laid out,\n   and
    each possibility examined in light of these requirements.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
