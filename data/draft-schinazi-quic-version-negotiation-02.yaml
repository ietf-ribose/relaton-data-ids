abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but
    instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client
    offered is unacceptable. This document describes a version negotiation mechanism
    that allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version. Optionally,
    if the original and negotiated version share a compatible Initial format, the
    negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip. Discussion of
    this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org
    [1] or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: http://github.com/ekr/draft-schinazi-quic-
    version-negotiation [2].</p>"
