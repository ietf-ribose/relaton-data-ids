abstract:
  content: "\t <t>TMMH is a 'universal' hash function suitable for messageauthentication
    in the Wegman-Carter paradigm. It is simple, quick,and especially appropriate
    for Digital Signal Processors and otherprocessors with a fast multiply operation.
    This document specifiesversion two of TMMH, which eliminates the large storage
    requirementfor hashing large messages that was present in version one.</p>"
