abstract:
  content: "\t <t>When DNS validators have trusted keys, but have been offline for
    alonger period, key rollover will fail and they are stuck with staletrust anchors.
    History service allows validators to query for olderDNSKEY RRsets and pick up
    the rollover trail where they left off.</p>"
