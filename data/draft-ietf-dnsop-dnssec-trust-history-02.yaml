abstract:
- content: "<p>When DNS validators have trusted keys, but have been offline for a
    longer period, key rollover will fail and they are stuck with stale trust anchors.
    History service allows validators to query for older DNSKEY RRsets and pick up
    the rollover trail where they left off.</p>"
