abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several, sometimes conflicting proposals have been offered
    for the\n   consideration of the PCN WG regarding PCN internal node and PCN edge\n
    \  node behaviors.  Based on the WG charter, the WG needs to make a\n   decision
    on which of the proposed PCN-interior-node and PCN-boundary-\n   nodes behaviors
    to endorse.  The primary goal of this draft is\n   twofold.  First, we attempt
    to summarize the functional differences\n   between the proposed alternatives.
    \ Second, we provide a brief\n   summary of performance evaluation results.  Finally
    we propose a view\n   on how a (parameterized) specification of the PCN-interior-node\n
    \  metering and marking function can be described to enable several of\n   the
    proposed behaviors.  We argue that if this parameterized\n   specification is
    used for specifying the PCN-interior-node behavior,\n   then it can support a
    range of behaviors at the PCN-boundary-node.\n   The decision on which of the
    PCN-boundary-node behaviors to choose\n   can then be considered separately.  We
    also discuss complexities\n   associated with choosing such uniform approach.\n\t
