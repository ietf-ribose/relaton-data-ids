abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections\n
    \  concerning features related to the use of attributes in NFSv4.1\n   related
    to file system location.  These features include migration,\n   which transfers
    responsibility for a file system from one server to\n   another, and facilities
    to support trunking by allowing discovery of\n   the set of network addresses
    to use to access a file system.  This\n   document updates RFC5661.\n\n\t </p>\n
