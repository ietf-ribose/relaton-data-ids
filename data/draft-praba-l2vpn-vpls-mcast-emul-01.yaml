abstract:
- content: "<p>In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide a logical
    interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific VPLS instance appear
    to be connected by a single LAN. A VPLS solution performs replication for multicast
    traffic at the ingress PE devices. When replicated at the ingress PE, multicast
    traffic wastes bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic is sent to sites with no members,
    and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites go through a shared path. This document
    addresses the above cases by using LDP signaling to emulate Multicast operation
    over VPLS with out using IGMP and PIM snooping as described in [VPLS-MCAST].</p>"
