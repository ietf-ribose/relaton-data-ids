abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within
    a\ndistributed World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary to\nfurnish
    a methodology which controls access to objects.  Access control\nmay include the
    ability to read an object, modify an object, or perform\nother more advanced functions
    upon an object.  Access control is\nnecessary to prevent unauthorized access or
    modification of objects\nwithin the authoring environment which could lead to
    unintended loss,\ndamage or disclosure of data.\n \nThis document proposes requirements
    for the support of access control\nwithin a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
    (WebDAV) environment.\nIt describes a model for the representation and interpretation
    of access\ncontrol policies, and a set of operations needed to manage policies
    in\nthat form.  It is intended that these requirements be supported within\nthe
    framework of the proposed WebDAV extensions [WEBDAV1] to HTTP\n[HTTP], in the
    form of additional protocol operations and compliance\nrequirements for clients
    and servers\n\t </p>\n      "
