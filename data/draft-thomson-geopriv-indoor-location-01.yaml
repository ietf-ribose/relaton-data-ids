abstract:
  content: <p>A method is described for constructing a Presence Information DataFormat
    - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document that contains locationinformation using a
    locally-defined coordinate reference system(CRS). This form of representation
    allows for use of locally-definedcoordinates with potential advantages for improved
    accuracy andusability in local context, in particular location applications thatoperate
    indoors. A framework for defining a local CRS is provided.A process for transformation
    of coordinates defined in the local CRSand the widely used World Geodetic System
    1984 (WGS84) CRS isdefined.Status of This MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted
    to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.Internet-Drafts
