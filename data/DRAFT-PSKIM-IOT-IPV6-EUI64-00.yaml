abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   An IoT-specific IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is\n
    \  suggested for diverse types of IoT devices. Both domain type and\n   device
    type are defined and combined with 16-bit hexadecimal number,\n   which is called
    the IoT type identifier. Then, this IoT type\n   identifier is reflected in generating
    EUI-64 for each IoT device. An\n   IoT-specific IPv6 address is developed using
    the stateless address\n   autoconfiguration with the network prefix and the modified
    EUI-64.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
