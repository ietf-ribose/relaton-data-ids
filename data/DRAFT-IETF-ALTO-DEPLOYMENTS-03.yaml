abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such
    as\n   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in\n   several
    equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\n   is not limited
    to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\n   of Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\n   guidance to these applications,
    which have to select one or several\n   hosts from a set of candidates, that are
    able to provide a desired\n   resource.  The protocol is under specification in
    the ALTO working\n   group.  This memo discusses deployment related issues of
    ALTO for\n   peer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary security considerations,
    and\n   also initial guidance for application designers using ALTO.\n\n\t </p>\n
