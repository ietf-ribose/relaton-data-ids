abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session InitiationProtocol
    (SIP), to address an error in the specified handling ofsuccess (200 class) responses
    to INVITE requests. Elements followingRFC 3261 exactly will misidentify retransmissions
    of the request as anew, unassociated, request. The correction involves modifying
    theINVITE transaction state machines. The correction also changes theway responses
    that cannot be matched to an existing transaction arehandled to address a security
    risk.</p>"
