abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines context replication, an alternative to the\ncontext
    initialization procedure found in ROHC (Robust Header\nCompression) [RFC-3095].
    Profiles defining support for context\nreplication may use the mechanism described
    herein to establish a new\ncontext based on another already existing context.\n\nContext
    replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of the\ncontext establishment
    procedure, and may be especially useful for the\ncompression of multiple short-lived
    flows that may be occurring\nsimultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as for
    example short-\nlived TCP flows.\n\t </p>\n      "
