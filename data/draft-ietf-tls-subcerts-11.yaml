abstract:
- content: "<p>The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS endpoint
    and the certification authority can create limitations. For example, the lifetime
    of certificates, how they may be used, and the algorithms they support are ultimately
    determined by the certification authority. This document describes a mechanism
    by which operators may delegate their own credentials for use in TLS, without
    breaking compatibility with peers that do not support this specification.</p>"
