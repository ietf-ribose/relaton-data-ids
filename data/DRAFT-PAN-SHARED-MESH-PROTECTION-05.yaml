abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery
    mechanism\n   in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set
    of\n   network resources for protection purposes.\n\n   In the context of MPLS-TP,
    it has been explicitly requested as a part\n   of the overall solution (Req. 67,
    68 and 69 in RFC5654 [RFC5654]).\n\n   It's important to note that each MPLS-TP
    LSP may be associated with\n   transport network resources.  In event of network
    failure, it may\n   require explicit activation on the protecting paths before
    switching\n   user traffic over.\n\n   In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling
    mechanism for\n   protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled
    MPLS-TP\n   networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
