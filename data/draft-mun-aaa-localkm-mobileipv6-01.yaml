abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a way to distribute secure key for optimizingAAA
    authentication procedure while a mobile node is away from it's home. The AAA infrastrucrue
    is used as an underlying framework which enables a Mobile-IPv6 node to get an
    global authentication by identifying it with an unique identifier NAI. The Diameter
    messages are exchanged to transfer information of mobile node between home andforeign
    AAA servers.The steps to complete an authentication procedure for mobile node
    in the visited link may be reduced by delegating the role for generatingand synchronizing
    keys to AAA server in the visited domain.The implications to existing entities
    supporting mobility such asattendant, AAA server in home and visited domain are
    discussed.The delegation is introduced and the related security issues are pointed
    out.</p>"
