abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP-AO technology was proposed to obsolete the TCP-MD5 option
    which\nwas developed to protect the BGP sessions between routers.  Besides\nof
    allowing users to choose which cryptographic algorithm(s) they\nwant to use to
    meet their security needs, TCP-AO provides key\ncoordination mechanism giving
    the ability to move from one key to\nanother within the same connection with zero
    segment loss by using\ntwo ID fields i.e.  KeyID and RNextKeyID.  The sender uses
    the\nRNextKeyID to indicate the receiver using the preferred MKT which\nwill authenticate
    the next incoming segments.  However, if the sender\nfinds its MKT which is used
    to authenticate the outgoing segments has\nbeen attacked and should be changed
    into a new one, it can do nothing\nbut wait for receiver to send a segment which
    carries a different\nRNextKeyID.\n\nIn this case, the communication becomes dangerous
    probably because\nthe sender always authenticates outgoing segments by an attacked
    key\nbefore the receiver wants to change the incoming key.  This document\nprovides
    a method giving the sender ability to inform the other part\nchange the RNextKeyID
    when the sender finds the key used in outgoing\nsegment is not safe any longer.\n\t
