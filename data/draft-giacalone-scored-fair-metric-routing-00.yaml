abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo defines a modular metric calculation system termed ScoredFair
    Metric Calculation (SFMC). SFMC can be integrated with LinkState and Distance
    Vector routing protocols and their extensions[1,4,5,6,7], enabling them to find
    network paths that support thehighest possible number of best metrics across a
    network. SFMC makesit possible to support and mix large sets of heterogeneous
    networkfeatures and capabilities.SFMC solves many of the issues inherent in routing
    protocols thatattempt to use complex sets of metrics by decoupling raw metric
    datafrom the input side of routing protocols. Unlike the past, SFMCregards all
    metrics all the time, while treating all metrics equally(by default).Additionally,
    the SFMC architecture provides a simple and flexibleinterface for extensive manipulation
    of path selection.Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.</p>"
