abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a solution for point to multipoint (P2MP)
    \nTraffic Engineering (TE). The objective is to optimize packet \nreplication
    and minimize state and intelligence in the core of the \nnetwork, while performing
    P2MP TE. The solution relies on RSVP-TE \nin the core of the network. It is based
    on setting up a P2MP LSP by \nmerging P2P LSPs in the network. The setup of P2P
    LSPs is source\nintiated. Simple enhancements are made to RSVP-TE to facilitate
    the set\nup of a P2MP TE LSP. There is no need to run a multicast routing \nprotocol
    in the network core. There can be various applications for \nP2MP TE LSPs such
    as multicast. Specification of how such applications \nwill use a P2MP LSP is
    outside the scope of this document.\n\t </p>\n      "
