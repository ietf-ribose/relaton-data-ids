abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
    view of the Service Provider network topology containing the points from which
    its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN, SDWAN). The data
    model augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding the concept of service-attachment-points.
    The service- attachment-points are an abstraction of the points to which network
    services (such as L3 VPN or L2 VPN) can be attached.</p>"
