abstract:
- content: "<p>Building management systems have evolved toward IP communication at
    the enterprise level during the past decade. IP implementation at the real-time
    control and sensor layers would provide a single pervasive protocol usable across
    the entire system increasing flexibility and code reuse. This document will describe
    the topology of these building networks, the application protocols widely used
    in their deployment and the application use cases.</p>"
