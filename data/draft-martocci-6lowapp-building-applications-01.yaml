  content: "<p>Building management systems have evolved toward IP communication atthe
    enterprise level during the past decade. IP implementation atthe real-time control
    and sensor layers would provide a singlepervasive protocol usable across the entire
    system increasingflexibility and code reuse. This document will describe the topologyof
    these building networks, the application protocols widely used intheir deployment
    and the application use cases.</p>"
