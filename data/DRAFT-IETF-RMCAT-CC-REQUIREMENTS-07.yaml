abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Congestion control is needed for all data transported across
    the\n   Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion\n   collapse.
    \ The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real-time\n   multimedia, which
    needs low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery, are\n   different from the requirements
    for bulk transfer like FTP or bursty\n   transfers like Web pages.  Due to an
    increasing amount of RTP-based\n   real-time media traffic on the Internet (e.g.
    with the introduction\n   of the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)), it is
    especially\n   important to ensure that this kind of traffic is congestion\n   controlled.\n\n
    \  This document describes a set of requirements that can be used to\n   evaluate
    other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure out\n   their fitness for
    this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of\n   possible requirements
    for real-time media congestion avoidance\n   technique.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
