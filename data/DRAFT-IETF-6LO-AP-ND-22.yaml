abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates the 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol\n
    \  defined in RFC 6775 and RFC 8505.  The new extension is called\n   Address
    Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects the\n   owner of an address
    against address theft and impersonation attacks\n   in a low-power and lossy network
    (LLN).  Nodes supporting this\n   extension compute a cryptographic identifier
    (Crypto-ID) and use it\n   with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The
    Crypto-ID\n   identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to\n
    \  provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an\n   address
    is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is\n   provided, only
    the owner of that address can modify the registration\n   information, thereby
    enforcing Source Address Validation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
