abstract:
- content: <p>XML signature standard as described in in RFC3275 [RFC3275] and defined
    by IETF/W3C references or identifies signed elements by their unique identities
    as specified by "id" attribute values in the given XML document. Hence, signed
    XML elements can be shifted from one location to another location in a XML document,and
    still, it does not have any effect on its ability to verify its signature. This
    flexibility paves the way for an attacker to tweak original XML message without
    getting noticed by the receiver. This document proposes to use absolute XPath
    as an "Positional Token" and modifies XML Signature algorithm to overcome the
    XML Signature wrapping attacks on XML signatures.</p>
