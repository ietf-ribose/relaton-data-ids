abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some networks, DHCP servers rely on Relay Agent Information
    option\n   appended by Relay Agents for IP address and other parameter\n   assignment
    policies.  This works fine when end hosts are directly\n   connected to Relay
    Agents.  In some network configurations, one or\n   more Layer 2 devices may reside
    between DHCP clients and Relay agent.\n   In these network scenarios, it is difficult
    to use the Relay Agent\n   Information option for IP address and other parameter
    assignment\n   policies effectively.  So there is a need for the device that is\n
    \  closest to the end hosts to append a Relay Agent Information option\n   in
    DHCP messages.  These devices are typically known as Layer 2 Relay\n   Agents.\n\n
    \  This document aims to describe the network scenarios where a Layer 2\n   Relay
    Agent is in use and also how it handles DHCP messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
