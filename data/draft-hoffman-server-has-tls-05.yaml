abstract:
- content: "<p>A server that hosts applications that can be run with or without TLS
    may want to communicate with clients whether the server is hosting an application
    only using TLS or also hosting the application without TLS. Many clients have
    a policy to try to set up a TLS session but fall back to insecure if the TLS session
    cannot be set up. If the server can securely communicate whether or not it can
    fall back to insecure tells such a client whether or not they should even try
    to set up an insecure session with the server. This document describes the use
    cases for this type of communication and a secure method for communicating that
    information.</p>"
