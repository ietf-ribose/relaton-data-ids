abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem\n
    \  protocol which owes its heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094,\n   and
    version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4\n   protocol
    supports traditional file access, while integrating support\n   for file locking
    and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for\n   strong security (and its
    negotiation), compound operations, client\n   caching, and internationalization
    have been added.  Of course,\n   attention has been applied to making NFS version
    4 operate well in an\n   Internet environment.\n\n   RFC3530bis formally obsoleting
    RFC 3530.  This document, together\n   with RFC3530bis replaces RFC 3530 as the
    definition of the NFS\n   version 4 protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
