abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NSIS state management needs to track data path changes and
    update the\n   states along the affected data paths.  However, in certain scenarios,\n
    \  there are multiple concurrent paths involved in the communication.\n   In this
    case, the normal NSIS scheme does not provide sufficient\n   support for the state
    manipulation.  Therefore, extra functionality\n   for data path identification
    and distinction is necessary.  In\n   current Internet, with the increasing use
    of multi-homing devices and\n   the employment of Mobile IP, the above issue is
    getting more\n   prominent.  This draft discusses in detail the problems and issues\n
    \  involved in the NSIS state management relevant to the data path\n   differentiation.
    \ Specific scenarios for multi-homing and Mobile IP\n   route optimization are
    studied.  Potential solution and its impacts\n   on current NSIS protocol design
    are discussed as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
