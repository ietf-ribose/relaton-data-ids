abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits
    (referred\n   as \"Kyznyechik\" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal standard\n
    \  GOST R 34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the block cipher\n   with
    block length of n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits, which is\n   also referred
    as \"Magma\".  The algorithm is an updated version of\n   older block cipher with
    block length of n=64 bits described in GOST\n   28147-89 (RFC 5830).  This document
    is intended to be a source of\n   information about the updated version of 64-bit
    cipher.  It may\n   facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications
    by\n   providing information for developers and users of GOST 64-bit cipher\n
    \  with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and decryption.\n\n\t
