abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>SCTP [RFC2960] supports IP multihoming at the transport layer.
    SCTP\nallows an association to span multiple local and peer IP addresses,\nand
    allows the application to dynamically change the primary\ndestination during an
    active association. We present a problem in the\ncurrent SCTP specification that
    results in unnecessary retransmissions\nand \"TCP-unfriendly\" growth of the sender's
    congestion window during\ncertain changeover conditions. We present the problem
    and propose an\nalgorithm called the Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware Congestion\nControl
    algorithm (SFR-CACC) as a solution. We recommend the addition\nof SFR-CACC to
    the SCTP specification [RFC2960].\n\t </p>\n      "
