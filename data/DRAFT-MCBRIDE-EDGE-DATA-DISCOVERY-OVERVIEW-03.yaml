abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery
    in\n   edge computing, and in particular for computing-in-the-network\n   (COIN),
    both the marshalling of data at the outset of a computation\n   and the persistence
    of the resultant data after the computation.\n   Although the data might originate
    at the network edge, as more and\n   more distributed data is created, processed,
    and stored, it becomes\n   increasingly dispersed throughout the network.  There
    needs to be a\n   standard way to find it.  New and existing protocols will need
    to be\n   developed to support distributed data discovery at the network edge\n
    \  and beyond.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
