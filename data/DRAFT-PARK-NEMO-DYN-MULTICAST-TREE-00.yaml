abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multicast Supporting is one of the most important issues in
    Network\n   Mobility Environment, because some killer applications related to
    \n   multicast service need to be provided on Next Generation Network.\n   However,
    current NEMO technique based on basic support protocol have\n   got many problems
    to support the service such as route optimization,\n   pinball route, mass of
    multicast problem, etc. the most signficant \n   problem of the service in NEMO
    environment is that Mobile Network \n   cannot be sure that multicasting from
    parent mobile networks is \n   possible when the network is nested, Moreover,
    even though the best \n   case that all mobile networks have its own multicast
    router is \n   supposed and multicasting is working well, the multicast route
    tree \n   can not be optimized due to different MNPs of the multicast routers\n
    \  in each nested network.\n    This document defines additional functions of
    each component to \n   enable dynamic multicast tree construction for multicast
    service\n   in Mobile Network.\n\t </p>\n      "
