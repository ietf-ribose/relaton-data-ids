abstract:
- content: "<p>5G slicing is a new feature that was introduced by the 3rd Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) in mobile networks. It covers slicing requirements
    for all mobile domains, including RAN (Radio Access Network), Core and Transport.
    This document describes a basic IETF Network Slice realization model in IP/MPLS
    networks, with a focus on fulfilling 5G slicing requirements. This IETF Network
    Slice realization model reuses many building blocks currently commonly used in
    communication service provider (CSP) networks.</p>"
