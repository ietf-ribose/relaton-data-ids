abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on IPv6, multiple mobility management protocols have been developed
    and generally they can be classified into two types: network-based and host-based.
    Different protocols have different functional requirements on the network element
    or the terminal and then a scheme should be used in order to support the negotiation
    and selection of adopted mobility management protocol when a terminal accesses
    to a new network. In this draft, this issue is considered and analyzed.</p>"
