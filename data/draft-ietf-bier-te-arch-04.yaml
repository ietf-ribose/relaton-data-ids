abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose path engineered
    replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication packets ([RFC8279]).
    This is called BIER-TE. BIER-TE leverages the BIER architecture ([RFC8279]) and
    extends it with a new semantic for bits in the bitstring. BIER-TE can leverage
    BIER forwarding engines with little or no changes. In BIER, the BitPositions (BP)
    of the packets bitstring indicate BIER Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER), and hop-by-hop
    forwarding uses a Routing Underlay such as an IGP. In BIER-TE, BitPositions indicate
    adjacencies. The BIFT of each BFR are only populated with BPs that are adjacent
    to the BFR in the BIER- TE topology. The BIER-TE topology can consist of layer
    2 or remote (route) adjacencies. The BFR then replicates and forwards BIER packets
    to those adjacencies. This results in the aforementioned strict and loose path
    forwarding. BIER-TE can co-exist with BIER forwarding in the same domain, for
    example by using separate sub-domains. In the absence of routed adjacencies, BIER-TE
    does not require a BIER routing underlay, and can then be operated without requiring
    an IGP routing protocol. BIER-TE operates without explicit in-network tree-building
    and carries the multicast distribution tree in the packet header. It can therefore
    be a good fit to support multicast path steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.</p>"
