abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide\n
    \ content negotiation for the resources with which they interact [1].\n  A framework
    for such negotiation is described in [2].  Part of this\n  framework is a way
    to describe the range of media features which\n  can be handled by the sender,
    recipient or document transmission\n  format of a message.  A format for a vocabulary
    of individual media\n  features and procedures for registering media features
    are\n  presented in [3].\n \n  This document describes an algebra and syntax that
    can be used to\n  define feature sets which are formed from combinations and\n
    \ relations involving individual media features.  Such feature sets\n  are used
    to describe the media feature handling capabilities of\n  message senders, recipients
    and file formats.\n \n  This document also outlines an algorithm for feature set
    matching.\n\t </p>\n      "
