abstract:
- content: <p>While there has been some work in the area of firewalls, concrete requirements
    for IPv6 firewalls have never been specified in the RFC series. The more limited
    experience with the IPv6 protocols and the more reduced number of firewalls that
    support IPv6 has made it rather difficult to infer what are reasonable features
    to expect in an IPv6 firewall. This has typically been a problem for network operators,
    who typically have to produce a "Request for Proposal" from scratch that describes
    such features. This document specifies a set of requirements for IPv6 firewalls,
    in order to establish some common- ground in terms of what features can be expected
    in them.</p>
