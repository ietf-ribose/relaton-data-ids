abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IP tunneling mechanisms have important applications in network\nsolutions
    and are widely used in numerous contexts such as security\n(VPN), IPv4 to IPv6
    transition, and mobility support (MobileIP and\nNEMO).  However, these tunneling
    mechanisms induce a large overhead\nresulting from adding several protocol headers
    in each packet.  This\noverhead deteriorates performance on wireless links which
    are scarce\nin resources.\n\nHeader compression methods are often used on connection
    oriented\ncommunication (e.g., UMTS networks) to reduce the overhead on the\nwireless
    part.  These header compression methods can be used on\ntunnel headers to reduce
    the protocol header overheads, independent\nof the payload type.  Although, several
    header compression methods\nexist, the header compression profiles defined by
    them are not\nadapted to the characteristics of IP tunneling.  This document\nspecifies
    a tunneling header compression protocol for IP tunneling\nmechanisms.\n\t </p>\n
