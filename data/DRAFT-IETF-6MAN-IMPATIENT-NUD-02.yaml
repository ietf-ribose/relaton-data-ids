abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.\n
    \  That function is very useful when a host has an alternative, for\n   instance
    multiple default routers, since it allows the host to switch\n   to the alternative
    in short time.  This time is 3 seconds after the\n   node starts probing by default.
    \ However, if there are no\n   alternatives, this is far too impatient.  This
    document specifies\n   relaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery retransmissions that
    allows an\n   implementation to choose different timeout behavior based on whether\n
    \  or not there are alternatives.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
