  content: "\t <t>This document introduces an extension to allow an adapted multiplebinding
    in hierarchical mobile network. Mobile node registers itsRCoA and LCoA in the
    home agent at same time to get two separateconnections between the mobile node
    and the home agent, or betweenthe mobile node and the correspondent node in Route
    Optimizationscenario. These connections provide robust communication betweenthe
    mobile node and correspondent nodes and mobile node can overcomethe failure on
