abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP)\n
    \  enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any\n   information.
    \ This document proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent\n   Address Family to
    be used for distribution of opaque data.  This\n   functionality is intended to
    be used by applications other than BGP\n   for exchange of their own data on top
    of BGP mesh.  The structure of\n   such data SHOULD NOT be interpreted by the
    regular BGP speakers,\n   rather the goal is to use BGP purely as a convenient
    and scalable\n   communication system.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
