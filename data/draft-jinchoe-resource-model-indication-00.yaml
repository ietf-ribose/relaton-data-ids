abstract:
- content: <p>There is much interest in "Internet of Things (IoT)" and multiple standards
    following the REST architectural style are under development. In a RESTful interaction,
    IoT devices need to understand each other's resource representations, both the
    semantic meaning and the syntactic form, to interact properly. For interoperability
    among different standards, it is helpful for CoAP endpoints to indicate the resource
    models they support. This document presents a scheme for IoT devices to exchange
    their resource model information and requests from IANA new Internet media types
    and CoAP Content-Format identifier for resource model indication.</p>
