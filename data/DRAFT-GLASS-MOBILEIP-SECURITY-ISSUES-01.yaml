abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IP is designed to provide IP services to roaming nodes,
    \nallowing them access to services, and enabling other nodes to reach \nthem,
    as if they were on their home domain.  By definition this \nfunctionality must
    be deployed on multiple subnets, and in many \ncases across domains, and while
    services which enable Mobile IP\nMUST be present on a subnet in order for a mobile
    node to have this\nreachability, deploying Mobile IP can introduce some security\nissues
    which may need to be addressed, by any network administrator\noverseeing Mobile
    IP subnets.\n\t </p>\n      "
