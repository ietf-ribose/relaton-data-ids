abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an information model and the corresponding\n
    \  YANG data model for monitoring Network Security Functions (NSFs) in\n   the
    Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework.  If\n   the monitoring
    of NSFs is performed in a comprehensive way, it is\n   possible to detect the
    indication of malicious activity, anomalous\n   behavior or the potential sign
    of denial of service attacks in a\n   timely manner.  This monitoring functionality
    is based on the\n   monitoring information that is generated by NSFs.  Thus, this\n
    \  document describes not only a YANG data diagram to specify an\n   information
    model for monitoring NSFs, but also the corresponding\n   YANG data model for
    monitoring NSFs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
