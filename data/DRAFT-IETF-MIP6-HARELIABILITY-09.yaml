abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The home agent can be a single point of failure when Mobile
    IPv6 and\n   its associated supporting protocols are operated in a system.  It
    is\n   critical to provide home agent reliability in the event of a home\n   agent
    crashing or becoming unavailable.  This would allow another\n   home agent to
    take over and continue providing service to the mobile\n   nodes.  This document
    describes the problem scope briefly, and\n   provides mechanisms of home agent
    failure detection, home agent state\n   transfer, and home agent switching for
    home agent redundancy and\n   reliability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
