abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes IGAP, which allows user IP user clients and
    IP\nrouters or network access servers to verify whether they can\nparticipate
    in a multicast group they hope and transport some\ninformation about it. IGAP
    is derived from IGMPv2, which can make\nusers join a multicast group, who has
    the claim to participate a\nmulticast group in a service. It's important for service
    providers\nto protect their revenue source.\n\t </p>\n      "
