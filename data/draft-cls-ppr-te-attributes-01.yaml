abstract:
- content: "<p>Preferred Path Routing (PPR) is concerned with setting up the route
    for a given prefix as specified in the path description along with a corresponding
    data plane/forwarding identifier PPR-ID. This document specifies an extension
    to PPR, a mechanism to perform resource reservations nodes on Preferred Path Routes
    (PPR) for IGPs (IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3). This is done by specifying the resources
    that need to be reserved along the path using PPR path attributes.</p>"
