abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to
    DS-Lite which moves the Network Address Translation function from the DS-Lite
    AFTR to the B4. It can be deployed in a DS-Lite network to gradually reduce the
    load of Carrier Grade NAT in the AFTR. However, when DS-Lite and lw4over6 co-exist
    in the same network, B4 elemtns and lwB4 elements may want to signal the DHCPv6
    server the type of AFTR (i.e. AFTR or lwAFTR) they request. In this memo, a new
    DHCPv6 option is proposed for lwB4 element to request the IPv6 address of its
    corresponding lwAFTR.</p>"
