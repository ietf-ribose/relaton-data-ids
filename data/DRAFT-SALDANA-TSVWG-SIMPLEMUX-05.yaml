abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks\n
    \  results in a low efficiency, when the size of the headers and the\n   payload
    are in the same order of magnitude.  In some situations,\n   multiplexing a number
    of small packets into a bigger one is desirable\n   in order to improve the efficiency.
    \ For example, a number of small\n   packets can be sent together between a pair
    of machines if they share\n   a common network path.  Thus, the traffic profile
    can be shifted from\n   small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead
    and the number\n   of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers.\n\n
    \  This document describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a\n   number
    of packets belonging to different protocols into a single\n   packet.  Small headers
    (separators) are added at the beginning of\n   each multiplexed packet, including
    some flags, the length and a\n   \"Protocol\" field.  This allows the inclusion
    of a number of packets\n   belonging to different protocols (multiplexed packets)
    on a packet of\n   another protocol (tunneling protocol).\n\n   In order to reduce
    the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers\n   is kept very low (it may
    be a single byte when multiplexing small\n   packets).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
