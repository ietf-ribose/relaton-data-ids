abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IPv6 specification allows IPv6 header chains of an arbitrary\n
    \  size.  The specification also allows options which can in turn extend\n   each
    of the headers.  In those scenarios in which the IPv6 header\n   chain or options
    are unusually long and packets are fragmented, or\n   scenarios in which the fragment
    size is very small, the first\n   fragment of a packet may fail to include the
    entire IPv6 header\n   chain.  This document discusses the interoperability and
    security\n   problems of such traffic, and updates RFC 2460 such that all IPv6\n
    \  packets are required to contain the entire IPv6 header chain within\n   the
    'minimum IPv6 MTU' (1280) bytes of the packet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
