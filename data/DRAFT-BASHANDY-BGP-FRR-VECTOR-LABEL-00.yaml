abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers
    PE1,\nPE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,...,
    CEm.  If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the
    core, it is desirable for a core router \"P\"\ncarrying traffic to the failed
    edge router PEi to immediately restore\ntraffic by re-tunneling packets originally
    tunneled to PEi and\ndestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers
    that\nadvertised P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is\nhighly
    desirable to keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions on external
    connectivity or complicating provisioning\neffort. Thus (1) a core router should
    not be required to learn any\nBGP prefix, (2) the size of the forwarding and routing
    tables in the\ncore routers should be independent of the number of BGP prefixes,
    (3)\nre-routing traffic without waiting for re-convergence must not cause\nloops,
    (4) provisioning effort should be kept at minimum, and (5)\nthere should be no
    restrictions on what edge routers advertise what\nprefixes. For labeled prefixes,
    (6) the label stack on the packet\nmust allow the repair PEj to correctly forward
    the packet and (7)\nthere must not be any need to perform more than one label
    lookup on\nany edge or core router during steady state\n\n\t </p>\n      "
