abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things concept refers to the usage of standard Internet
    protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing communication. Although
    the security needs are well-recognized, it is still not fully clear how existing
    IP-based security protocols should be applied to this new setting. This Internet-Draft
    first provides an overview of security architecture, its deployment model and
    general security needs in the context of the lifecycle of a thing. Then, it presents
    challenges and requirements for the successful roll-out of new applications and
    usage of standard IP- based security protocols when applied to get a functional
    Internet of Things.</p>"
