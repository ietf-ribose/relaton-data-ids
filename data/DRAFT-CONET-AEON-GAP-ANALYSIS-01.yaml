abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Identification and treatment of application flows have become
    more\n   and more important for network operators.  In order to efficiently\n
    \  distinguish ICPs' traffic, coordination between ISPs and ICPs is\n   required.
    \ IP flow identification can be based on ICPs' traffic\n   carrying some mutually
    agreed identifiers.  This document analyzes\n   the technical gap between the
    current network functions and required\n   network capability to enable such functionality.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
