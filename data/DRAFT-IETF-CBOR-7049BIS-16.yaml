abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
    whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly
    small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as
    ASN.1 and MessagePack.\n\n This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial
    improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with
    the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
