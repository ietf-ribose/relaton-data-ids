abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need
    to\ncollect user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, user\ninput
    has been done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurred\non extending these
    DTMF models into the domain of SIP, typically by\ntransporting DTMF digits or
    user input through some SIP message to an\napplication server. We propose a broader
    framework for stimulus using\nmarkup. The approach can support traditional DTMF
    user input, but\nalso a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus
    that\ngoes well beyond DTMF.\n\t </p>\n      "
