abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document [if approved] formally deprecates Transport Layer\n
    \  Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] and moves\n   these
    documents to the historic state.  These versions lack support\n   for current
    and recommended cipher suites, and various government and\n   industry profiiles
    of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding\n   these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2
    has been the recommended version for\n   IETF protocols since 2008, providing
    sufficient time to transition\n   away from older versions.  Products having to
    support older versions\n   increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase
    opportunities\n   for misconfigurations.  Supporting these older versions also
    requires\n   additional effort for library and product maintenance.\n\n   This
    document updates the backward compatibility sections of TLS RFCs\n   [[list TBD]]
    to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1.  This\n   document also updates RFC
    7525.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
