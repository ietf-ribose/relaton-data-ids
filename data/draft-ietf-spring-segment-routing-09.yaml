abstract:
  content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node
    steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments. A segment
    can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. A segment can have
    a local semantic to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR allows to enforce
    a flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow
    state only at the ingress node to the SR domain. Segment Routing can be directly
    applied to the MPLS architecture with no change on the forwarding plane. A segment
    is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack
    of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion
    of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. Segment Routing can
    be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment
    is encoded as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered
    list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated
    by the Destination Address of the packet. The next active segment is indicated
    by a pointer in the new routing header.</p>"
