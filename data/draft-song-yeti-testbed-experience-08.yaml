abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single
    root, known as the Root Server System. Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    root server testbed that provides an environment where technical and operational
    experiments can safely be performed without risk to production root server infrastructure.
    Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project and is not affiliated with ICANN,
    IANA or any Root Server Operator. The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes
    various novel and experimental components. These differences from the Root Server
    System have operational consequences; by deploying such a system globally but
    outside the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides an opportunity
    to gain insight into those consequences without threatening the stability of the
    DNS. This document neither addresses the relevant policies under which the Root
    Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing any aspect of its
    implementation or operation. This document aims solely to document the technical
    and operational experience of deploying a system which is similar to but different
    from the Root Server System.</p>"
