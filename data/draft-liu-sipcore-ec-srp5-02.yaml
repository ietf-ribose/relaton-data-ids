abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the way that the elliptic curve secure remote
    protocol (EC-SRP) is applied to SIP authentication. SIP Client and server perform
    mutual authenticate by using the modern 'zero knowledge' method without disclosing
    the password in the process. It has low computation complexity and low bandwidth
    consumption due to the use of elliptical curve cryptography. This makes it more
    suitable for resource-constrained environments,e.g. wireless network. The security
    of the scheme is based on the computational intractability of the elliptic curve
    discrete logarithm problem. It is resilient to various kinds of attacks, including
    off-line dictionary attacks.</p>"
