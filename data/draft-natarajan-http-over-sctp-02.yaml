abstract:
  content: "<p>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] requires a reliabletransport
    for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP hasbeen used for this purpose,
    this document proposes an alternative --the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similarto TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport connection
    toapplications. Additionally, SCTP offers innovative servicesunavailable in TCP.
    This draft (i) specifies HTTP over SCTP'smultistreaming service, (ii) lists open
    issues warranting morediscussion and/or investigation, and (iii) shares some lessonslearned
    from implementing HTTP over SCTP. Finally, this documenthighlights SCTP services
    that better match HTTP's needs than TCP.</p>"
