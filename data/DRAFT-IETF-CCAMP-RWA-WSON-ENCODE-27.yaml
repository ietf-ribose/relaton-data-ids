abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that
    certain\n   key information elements are made available to facilitate path\n   computation
    and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs).\n   The information model
    described in \"Routing and Wavelength\n   Assignment Information for Wavelength
    Switched Optical Networks\"\n   shows what information is required at specific
    points in the WSON.\n   Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that
    may be of\n   general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are\n
    \  specific to WSONs.\n\n   This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic
    encodings for\n   the WSON specific information elements. It is intended that\n
    \  protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how\n   information
    is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be used\n   to extend GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols. In addition these\n   encodings could be used by other
    mechanisms to convey this same\n   information to a path computation element (PCE).\n\n\n\n\n\t
