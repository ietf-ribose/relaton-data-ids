abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IETF has defined a number of technologies and techniques that\ntargets
    the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  Documented techniques\nidentify high level
    use cases and generalized options for networks.\nOperators may have difficulty
    attempting to apply the documented\ntechniques to their networks since each network
    and system operates\nuniquely within the global Internet.  Operators may require
    guidance\non how to identify the appropriate technology, or technologies, and\napply
    them to their specific environments.  This memo describes the\nproblem statements
    related to the transition of operator's networks\nto IPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
