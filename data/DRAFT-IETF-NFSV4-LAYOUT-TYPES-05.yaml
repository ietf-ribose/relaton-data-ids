abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the requirements which individual pNFS
    layout\n   types need to meet in order to work within the parallel NFS (pNFS)\n
    \  framework as defined in RFC5661.  In so doing, it aims to more\n   clearly
    distinguish between requirements for pNFS as a whole and\n   those those specifically
    directed to the pNFS File Layout.  The lack\n   of a clear separation between
    the two set of requirements has been\n   troublesome for those specifying and
    evaluating new Layout Types.  In\n   this regard, this document effectively updates
    RFC5661.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
