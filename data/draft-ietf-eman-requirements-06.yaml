abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    energy management. The requirements defined in this document concern monitoring
    functions as well as control functions. In detail, the focus of the requirements
    is on the following features: identification of powered entities, monitoring of
    their power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power properties,
    consumed energy, and contained batteries. Further requirements are included to
    enable control of powered entities' power supply and power state. This document
    does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations
    but rather features that must be supported by standards for energy management.</p>"
