abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the\n
    \  network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units\n   (MTUs)
    must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6\n   Packet Too Big
    (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation\n   and reassembly (also
    known as \"link adaptation\") at a layer below\n   IPv6.  This latter category
    of links is often performance-challenged\n   to accommodate steady-state link
    adaptation.  A common case that\n   exhibits these link characteristics is seen
    for IPv6-in-IP tunnels.\n   Additionally, IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery
    issues even\n   when no link adaptation is necessary by performing a small amount
    of\n   fragmentation and/or by probing the path as necessary.  This document\n
    \  therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better\n   accommodate
    path MTU issues.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
