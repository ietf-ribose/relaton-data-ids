abstract:
- content: "<p>Proposed Standard protocol extensions now exist to the Domain Name
    System (DNS) to authenticate the data in DNS and provide key distribution services
    (RFC 2065). This draft proposes a special in-key.int domain which would allow
    entities to be found from their keys if they have voluntarily registered them
    in that domain.</p>"
