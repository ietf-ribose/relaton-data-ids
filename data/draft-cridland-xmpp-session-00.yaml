abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) historically
    had a Session Establishment request defined in RFC 3921 which clients were required
    to perform at the beginning of a session. RFC 6121 dropped this entirely. This
    specification reinstates it as an optional no-op to aid backwards compability,
    matching commonly deployed workarounds.</p>"
