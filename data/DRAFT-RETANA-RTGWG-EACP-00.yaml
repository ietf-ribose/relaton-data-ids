abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There has been, for several years, a rising concern over the
    energy\n   usage of large scale networks.  This concern is strongly focused on\n
    \  campus, data center, and other highly concentrated deployments of\n   network
    infrastructure.  Given the steadily increasing demand for\n   higher network speeds,
    always-on service models, and ubiquitous\n   network coverage, it is also of growing
    importance for\n   telecommunication networks both local and wide area in scope.
    \ One of\n   the issues in moving forward to reduce energy usage is to ensure
    that\n   the network can still meet the performance specifications required to\n
    \  support the applications running over it.\n\n   This document provides an overview
    of the various areas of concern in\n   the interaction between network performance
    and efforts at energy\n   aware control planes, as a guide for those working on
    modifying\n   current control planes or designing new control planes to improve
    the\n   energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network\n   deployments.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
