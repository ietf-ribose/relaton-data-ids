abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) stands for the universal\n
    \  interconnection of smart objects and back end users with the help of\n   IP
    protocols.  Secure key management among the smart objects is an\n   important
    aspect of IoT security.  Due to the high levels of resource\n   constraints of
    the devices in terms of memory, battery capacity and\n   CPU power, and other
    network characteristics such as mobility,\n   scalability, heterogeneity and limited
    bandwidth, the conventional\n   security protocols cannot be directly deployed
    in IoT networks in\n   their raw formats.  We propose a lightweight DTLS-based
    keying\n   mechanism for CoAP IoT smart objects which supports the scalability\n
    \  of the network and node mobility.  The protocol consumes less device\n   resources
    and minimum network bandwidth by incurring low message\n   overhead.  The smart
    objects can securely access the network and\n   obtain certificates after an initial
    configuration irrespective of\n   the manufacturer standards.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
