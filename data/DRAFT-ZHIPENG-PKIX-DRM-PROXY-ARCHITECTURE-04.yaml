abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a method and its architecture for proxy\napplication
    based on the PKI environment with X.509 certificate\n[X.509].  This kind of proxy
    service is applicable in the occasions\nthat a proxy entity is authorized by the
    client to implement the\ntasks with the service provider.  As a typical application,
    this\nmethod can be used on DRM service regardless the specific DRM\nstandard
    which is implemented on the interface between the Client\nDevice and Service Server.
    \ An DRM instance of the PKI proxy service\nis given in the appendix of this document
    and is fully addressed to\nsupport the proxy architecture defined in this document.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
