abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distributerouting
    information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a criticalcomponent of the Internet's
    routing infrastructure. It is highlyvulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks
    both in theory and inpractice, due to the lack of a scalable means of verifying
    theauthenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic. This document isa protocol
    specification for Secure BGP (S-BGP), an extension toBGP-4. S-BGP adheres to the
    principle of least privilege and usescountermeasures that create an authentication
    and authorizationsystem that addresses most of the security problems associated
    withBGP. To facilitate adoption and deployment, S-BGP is designed tominimize the
    overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) added by itscountermeasures and to be
    interoperable with the current BGP so as tobe incrementally deployable.</p>"
