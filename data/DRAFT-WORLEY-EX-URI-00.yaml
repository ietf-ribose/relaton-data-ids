abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a number of
    response\n   codes which a SIP agent can use to indicate that it cannot find a\n
    \  suitable destination to which to send a request.  Unfortunately, this\n   set
    of response codes was not carefully designed, making it difficult\n   in many
    cases for a proxy to select a response code that accurately\n   reflects the proxy's
    knowledge about the request URI.  This document\n   describes these response codes
    and their current usage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
