abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms
    to\n   install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.\n
    \  At present, almost all implementations of NETCONF are based on TCP\n   based
    protocol. QUIC, a new UDP-based, secure and multiplexed transport\n   protocol,
    can facilitate to improve the transportation performance,\n   information security
    and resource utility when being used as an\n   infrastructure layer of NETCONF.
    This document describes how to use the\n   QUIC protocol as the transport protocol
    of NETCONF(It is so called\n   NETCONFoQUIC).\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
