abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposal discusses technical issues related to deliveryand
    control of IP multimedia services, such as video-conferencing,involving heterogeneous
    end terminals. In particular, it describesthe design and implementation of an
    experimental system forinterworking between IETF SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
    and ISOMPEG-4 DMIF (Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) session andcall
    control signaling protocols. This IP videoconferencinginterworking system is composed
    of two core units for supportingdelivery of audio-video streams from a DMIF domain
    to a SIP domain(i.e. DMIF2SIP unit) and from a SIP domain to a DMIF domain (i.e.SIP2DMIF
    unit). These units perform various translation functionsfor transparent establishment
    and control of multimedia sessionsacross IP networking environment, including,
    session protocolconversion, service gateway conversion and address translation.</p>"
