abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n
    \  guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and
    bounded latency.  As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in\n   addition
    to the best practice security measures taken for any\n   mission-critical network,
    additional security measures may be needed\n   whose purpose is exclusively to
    secure the intended operation of\n   these novel service properties.  This document
    addresses specifically\n   those security considerations, with the assumption
    that the reader is\n   already familiar with network security best practices for
    the data\n   plane technologies underlying a given DetNet implementation.  This\n
    \  document defines a threat model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks,\n   including
    their potential impacts and mitigations.\n\n   A given DetNet may require securing
    only certain aspects of DetNet\n   performance, for example extremely low data
    loss rates but not\n   necessarily bounded latency.  Therefore this document provides
    an\n   association of threats against various use cases by industry, and\n   also
    against the individual service properties as defined in the\n   DetNet Use Cases.\n\n
    \  This document also addresses common DetNet security considerations\n   related
    to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be\n   identified as
    supported by DetNet), thereby complementing the\n   Security Considerations sections
    of the various DetNet Data Plane\n   (and other) DetNet documents.\n\n\t </p>\n
