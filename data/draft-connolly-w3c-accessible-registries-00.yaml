abstract:
- content: "<p>Registries are a critical part of many of the systems which inhabit
    the Internet today. Unfortunately, not a lot of the assignments within those registries
    are as accessible as they could be. This document outlines a best current practice
    approach to improving the accessibility of assignments within registries using
    ubiquitous technologies and low cost supporting policies.</p>"
