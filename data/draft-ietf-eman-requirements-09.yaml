abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    energy management. The requirements defined in this document concern monitoring
    functions as well as control functions. In detail, the focus of the requirements
    is on the following features: identification of energy-managed devices and their
    components, monitoring of their Power State, power inlets, power outlets, actual
    power, power properties, received energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.
    Further requirements are included to enable control of their power supply and
    Power State. This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
    by compliant implementations but rather features that must be supported by standards
    for energy management.</p>"
