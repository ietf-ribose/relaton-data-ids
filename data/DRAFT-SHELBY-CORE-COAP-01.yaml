abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),\na
    specialized transfer protocol for use with constrained networks and\nnodes for
    machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy and\nbuilding automation.
    \ These constrained nodes often have 8-bit\nmicrocontrollers with small amounts
    of ROM and RAM, while networks\nsuch as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates
    and typical\nthroughput of 10s of kbps.  CoAP provides request/reply and\nsubscribe/notify
    interaction models between appliciation end-points,\nsupports built-in resource
    discovery, and includes key web concepts\nsuch as URIs and RESTful methods.  CoAP
    easily translates to HTTP for\nintegration with the web while meeting specialized
    requirements such\nas multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for\nconstrained
    environments.\n\t </p>\n      "
