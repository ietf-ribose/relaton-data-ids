abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput
    (L4S). The insight on which L4S is based is that the root cause of queuing delay
    is in the congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. With the
    L4S architecture all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition
    away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,
    to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little queuing, aided by
    explicit congestion signalling from the network. This new class of congestion
    controls can provide low latency for capacity-seeking flows, so applications can
    achieve both high bandwidth and low latency. The architecture primarily concerns
    incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S
    congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared
    network. These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and throughput performance
    using an L4S-compliant congestion controller is usually much better (and rarely
    worse) than performance would have been using a 'Classic' congestion controller,
    and that competing flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically
    not impacted by the presence of L4S. These characteristics are important to encourage
    adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S compliant network elements.
    The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to isolate
    L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that allow network elements
    to identify L4S traffic; and host support for L4S congestion controls.</p>"
