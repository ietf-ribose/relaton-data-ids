abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document aims to draw the attention of the ICNRG community
    to\n   network management, an important but hitherto underdeveloped area of\n
    \  research in information-centric networking.  We consider that the\n   availability
    of modern management mechanisms for information-centric\n   networks will foster
    their deployment in real-world environments.\n   For example, we argue that there
    is a need for creating basic network\n   management tools early on while ICN is
    still in the design and\n   experimentation phases that can evolve over time.
    \ Perhaps ICN can\n   borrow successful mechanisms from the host-centric paradigm
    and adapt\n   them to the new network primitives.  Alternatively, novel network\n
    \  management schemes can be designed based on ICN primitives.  As a\n   discussion
    starter, this document summarizes recently published\n   approaches for ICN network
    management.  In particular, this first\n   version presents a management framework
    for named data networking and\n   reviews previous work on NetInf management.\n\n\t
