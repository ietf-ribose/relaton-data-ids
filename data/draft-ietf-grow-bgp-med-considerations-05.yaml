abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute provides a mechanism for BGP
    speakers to convey to an adjacent AS the optimal entry point into the local AS.
    While BGP MEDs function correctly in many scenarios, a number of issues may arise
    when utilizing MEDs in dynamic or complex topologies. This document discusses
    implementation and deployment considerations regarding BGP MEDs and provides information
    with which implementers and network operators should be familiar. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
