abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the use of Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection\n   (BFD) for multi-point networks to provide nodes that participate
    in\n   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) with the sub-\n   second
    convergence.  Optional extension to PIM-SM Hello, as specified\n   in RFC 7761,
    to bootstrap point-to-multipoint BFD session. also\n   defined in this document.\n\n\t
