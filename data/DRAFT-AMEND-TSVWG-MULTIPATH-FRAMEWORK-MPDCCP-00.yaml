abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   More and more of today's devices are multi-homing capable,
    in\n   particular 3GPP user equipment like smartphones.  In the current\n   standardization
    of the next upcoming mobile network generation 5G\n   Rel. 16, this is especially
    targeted in the study group Access\n   Traffic Steering Switching Splitting [3GPP,
    TR 23.793].  ATSSS\n   describes the flexible selection or combination of 3GPP
    untrusted\n   access like Wi-Fi and cellular access, overcoming the single-access\n
    \  limitation of today's devices and services.  Another multi-\n   connectivity
    scenario is the Hybrid Access [draft-lhwxz-hybrid-\n   access-network-architecture,
    draft-muley-network-based-bonding-\n   hybrid-access], providing multiple access
    for CPEs, which extends the\n   traditional way of single access connectivity
    at home to dual-\n   connectivity over 3GPP and fixed access.  A missing piece
    in the\n   ATSSS and Hybrid Access is the access and path measurement for\n   efficient
    and beneficial traffic steering decisions.  This becomes\n   particularly important
    in heterogeneous access networks with a\n   multitude of volatile access paths.
    \ MP-TCP can be employed in such\n   scenarios and concerning the ATSSS, it is
    the agreed protocol for the\n   traffic splitting mode.  A decision for MP-TCP
    though leaves the\n   increasing share of UDP in today's traffic mix (https://arxiv.org/\n
    \  abs/1801.05168) unconsidered.  In this document, a network\n   architecture
    leveraging the MP-DCCP network protocol is proposed,\n   which enables above scenarios
    and address the formulated issues\n   either independent or complementary to MP-TCP.\n\n\t
