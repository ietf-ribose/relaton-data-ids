abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multi-link transport can offer higher bandwidth and more robust
    \nconnections. Because of a wide variety of emerged wireless access \ntechnologies,
    a mobile host can potentially have subscriptions and \naccess more than one wireless
    network simultaneously. This document \nintroduces example applications which
    use multiple links in a \nconnection simultaneously and illustrates the advantages
    of multi-link \ntransport. A problem with those applications is that the efficient
    \nmulti-link transport needs much more knowledge about each link \ncharacteristics
    such as bandwidth, delay, reliability and robustness.\nThis document defines the
    requirements for efficient and adaptive\nmulti-link transport and also describes
    the link information that\nmulti-stream senders can require.\n\t </p>\n      "
