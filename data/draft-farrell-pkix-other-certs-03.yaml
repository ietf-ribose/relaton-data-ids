abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Some applications that associate state information with public keycertificates
    can benefit from a way to link together a set ofcertificates belonging to the
    same end entity that can safely beconsidered to be equivalent for the purposes
    of referencing thatapplication state information. This memo defines a certificateextension
    that supports such linkage that can allow applications toestablish the required
    linkage without introducing a new applicationprotocol data unit.</p>"
