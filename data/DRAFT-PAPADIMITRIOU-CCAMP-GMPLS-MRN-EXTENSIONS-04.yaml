abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   There are requirements for the support of networks ccomprising
    LSRs \n   with different data plane switching layers controlled by a single \n
    \  Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane \n   instance,
    referred to as GMPLS Multi-Layer Networks/Multi-Region \n   Networks (MLN/MRN).
    This document defines extensions to GMPLS routing \n   and signaling protocols
    so as to support the operation of GMPLS \n   Multi-Layer/Multi-Region Networks.
