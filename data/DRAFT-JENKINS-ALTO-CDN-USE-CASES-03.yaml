abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For some time, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) have been
    used in\n   the delivery of some Internet services (e.g. delivery of websites,\n
    \  software updates and video delivery) as they provide numerous\n   benefits
    including reduced delivery cost for cacheable content,\n   improved quality of
    experience for end users and increased robustness\n   of delivery.\n\n   In order
    to derive the optimal benefit from a CDN it is preferable to\n   deliver content
    from the servers (caches) that are \"closest\" to the\n   End User requesting
    the content, where \"closest\" may be as simple as\n   \"geographical or network
    distance\" combined with CDN server load\n   within a location, but may also consider
    other more complex\n   combinations of metrics and CDN or Network Service Provider
    (NSP)\n   policies.\n\n   There are a number of different ways in which a CDN
    may obtain the\n   necessary network topology and/or cost information to allow
    it to\n   serve End Users from the most optimal servers/locations, such as\n   static
    configuration, passively listening to routing protocols\n   directly, active probing
    of underlying network(s), or obtaining\n   topology and cost by querying an information
    service such as the ALTO\n   map &amp; cost services.\n\n   This document describes
    the use cases for a CDN to be able to obtain\n   network topology and cost information
    from an ALTO server(s).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
