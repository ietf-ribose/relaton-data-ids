abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Nework devices and applications are increasingly connected
    to a\n   variety of smart modems whose incoming and outgoing link rates can be\n
    \  varied over time to suit the channel characteristics.  Such rate\n   changes
    can result from use of adaptive coding and modulation.  The\n   link rate and
    conditions offered by the modem to connected devices\n   therefore vary.  In order
    for connected devices and applications to\n   get the most out of the modem's
    link capacity, it is necessary for\n   the applications and connected devices
    to condition traffic.  Thus,\n   they need some knowledge of the modem's link
    conditions.  This\n   document describes one simple method for a modem to advertise
    link\n   rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses\n   alternative
    approaches to communicating this information.  While the\n   mechanism in this
    document is described in the context of a modem, it\n   can also be broadly applied
    to other scenarios such as cryptographic\n   devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
