abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
    origin\n   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n
    \  signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain
    of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular
    node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that\n   will allow an end
    user to establish the trusted key state of the\n   resolvers that handle the user's
    DNS queries.  This allows users to\n   discover the trusted key state used by
    their DNS resolution service.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
