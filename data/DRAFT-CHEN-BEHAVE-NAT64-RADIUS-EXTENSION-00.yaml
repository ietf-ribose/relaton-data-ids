abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes new radius attributes for stateful NAT64.
    \ The\n   extensions are used to provide geo-location services with an exact\n
    \  IPv6 soruce address.  The message flow to deliver the NAT64 binding\n   information
    between radius clients and servers is also described.\n   Therefore, accurate
    location could be traced out depending on the\n   radius method.\n\n\t </p>\n
