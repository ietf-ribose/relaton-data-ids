abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an improved version of INSIGNIA[1][2],\nwhich
    is a framework supporting quality of service(QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. INSIGNIA
    is an in-band signaling system, and 'in-band \nsignaling' means the control information
    is carried along with data \nin IP packets. In this memo we introduce network
    measurement into \nINSIGNIA, and then this system can highly responsive to changes
    of \nperformance on mobile ad hoc networks. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
