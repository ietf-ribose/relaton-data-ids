abstract:
- content: "<p>The Designated forwarder concept is leveraged to prevent looping of
    BUM traffic into tenant network sourced across NVO fabric for multihoming deployments.
    [RFC7432] defines a prelimn approach to select the DF for an ES,VLAN or ES,Vlan
    Group panning across multiple NVE's. [RFC8584] makes the election logic more robust
    and fine grained inculcating fair election of DF handling most of the prevalent
    use-cases. This document presents a deployment problem and a corresponding solution
    which cannot be easily resolve by rules mentioned in [RFC7432] and [RFC8584].</p>"
