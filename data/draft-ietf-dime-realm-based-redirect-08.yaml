abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify one
    or more individual hosts to which a Diameter message may be redirected by an upstream
    Diameter node. However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect
    messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This document
    specifies a mechanism by which this can be achieved. New applications may incorporate
    this capability by reference to the present document. This memo updates Sections
    6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage
    and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs.</p>"
