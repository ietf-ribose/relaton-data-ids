abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to extend the capabilities of Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (BFD). These extensions enable BFD to measure performance
    metrics like packet loss and packet delay. Also, a method to perform lightweight
    on-demand authentication is defined in this specification.</p>"
