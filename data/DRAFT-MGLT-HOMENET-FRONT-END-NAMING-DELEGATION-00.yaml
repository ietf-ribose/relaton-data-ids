abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a Naming Delegation Architecture that
    makes\n   possible End Users to reach the hosts or services of their Home\n   Network
    using Names instead of IP addresses.\n\n   This document shows how the Naming
    Delegation between the CPE and the\n   ISP can be set so the CPE is not exposed
    on the Internet.  This\n   document describes an Naming Architecture where ISPs
    provide Front\n   End Delegating DNS Servers whereas the CPEs constitute a Back
    End\n   Network of Delegated DNS Servers.  All DNS queries for any Home\n   Network
    are addressed to the Delegating Front End Server.  The\n   response is expected
    to be stored on a CPE, and the Front End\n   Delegating DNS Server sends a DNS
    Query to that CPE before answering\n   to the initial DNS query.\n\n   The negotiation
    between the CPE and the ISP is using DHCP Options.\n   This document provides
    options so Front End Delegating and the\n   Delegated DNS Servers configure their
    respective Zone files and so\n   that CPEs restrict access and protect themselves
    from unauthorized\n   DNS Queries.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
