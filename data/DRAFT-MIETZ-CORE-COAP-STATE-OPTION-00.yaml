abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices
    which\n   are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such\n
    \  as temperature on a precise scale.  These sensor values are made\n   available
    by a resource on the CoAP endpoint.  However, for many\n   applications it is
    not necessary to have the full precision a sensor\n   can provide.  It's often
    even enough to only have some high-level\n   states instead of raw values.  This
    document presents a new option\n   for CoAP to dynamically create new resources
    for a sensor which\n   provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw
    sensor values.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
