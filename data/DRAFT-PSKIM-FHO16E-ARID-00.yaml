abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes a new fast handover mechanism for Mobile
    IPv6 \n   based IEEE 802.16e wireless networks. To implement the proposed \n   mechanism,
    the IEEE 802.16e neighbor advertisement message, named \n   MOB_NBR-ADV, sent
    periodically by a serving base station (BS) is \n   assumed to be defined newly
    by adding a specific subfield to the \n   available reserved field. In addition,
    Router Information \n   Request/Reply messages used in the network layer are defined
    newly. \n   The proposed mechanism provides the faster acquisition of new \n   access
    router's network information than the existing one, which \n   might be advantageous
    for the low handover latency. In addition, the\n   proposed mechanism might reduce
    amount of traffic in comparison with\n   the existing one, which might be remarkable
    when there are many \n   mobile nodes that are now connecting to the current access
    router \n   (AR). Moreover, in the proposed mechanism, a mobile node can know
    \n   whether it changes AR or BS, which can remove redundant traffic \n   of the
    existing one.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
