abstract:
- content: "<p>In the original Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME document (RFC
    2634), a structure for cryptographically linking the certificate to be used in
    validation with the signature was introduced; this structure was hardwired to
    use SHA-1. This document allows for the structure to have algorithm agility and
    defines a new attribute for this purpose. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
