abstract:
- content: "<p>Browsers and web applications may want to know if there are one or
    more DoH servers associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the client is
    already using. This would allow them to get DNS responses from a resolver that
    the user (or, more likely, the user's network administrator) has already chosen.
    This document describes a protocol for a resolver to tell a client what its associated
    DoH servers are.</p>"
