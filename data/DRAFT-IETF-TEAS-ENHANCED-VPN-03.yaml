abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified
    and\n   potential new networking technologies as components to provide an\n   Enhanced
    Virtual Private Network (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to\n   support the needs
    of new applications, particularly applications that\n   are associated with 5G
    services, by utilizing an approach that is\n   based on existing VPN and TE technologies
    and adds features that\n   specific services require over and above traditional
    VPNs.\n\n   Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network\n
    \  slicing, but could also be of use in its own right.  It is not\n   envisaged
    that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be deployed in a\n   network and, in
    particular, it is not intended that all VPNs\n   supported by a network will use
    VPN+ techniques.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
