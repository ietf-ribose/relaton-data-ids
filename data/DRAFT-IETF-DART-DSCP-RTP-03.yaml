abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the interaction between Differentiated\n
    \  Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality\n   and
    real-time network communication, including communication based on\n   the Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ is based on network\n   nodes applying different
    forwarding treatments to packets whose IP\n   headers are marked with different
    DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs).  As a\n   result, use of different DSCPs within
    a single traffic stream may\n   cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering).
    \ In\n   addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic\n
    \  source and destination.  This document covers the implications of\n   these
    DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including\n   WebRTC.\n\n\t
