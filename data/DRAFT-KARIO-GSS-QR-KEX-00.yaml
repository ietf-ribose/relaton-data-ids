abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC4462.
    \ It\n   defines a new key exchange method that uses GSS-API in a way to\n   provide
    key exchange method that is resistant to attacks by quantum\n   computers.  The
    purpose of this specification is to provide an easy-\n   to-implement upgrade
    to environments that require resistance against\n   quantum computers before widely
    accepted post-quantum cryptography\n   algorithms are established.\n\n\t </p>\n
