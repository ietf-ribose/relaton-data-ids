abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PKIs are used to provide scalability and ease key management.
    \ One\n   type of PKIs that is predominant for securing communications and data\n
    \  is based on the X.509 standard.  Since the security of PKIs,\n   ultimately,
    depends on the security of the cryptographic building\n   blocks that are used
    for authentication and encryption, the standards\n   community made algorithm
    agility a priority.  Algorithm agility, in\n   particular, enables upgrading to
    newly available algorithms when\n   needed.\n\n   The CompositeCrypto (i.e., CompositeKey
    and CompositeSignature\n   structures) described in this document provides an
    additional tool\n   that enables the use of multiple algorithms to authenticate
    data\n   without the need to use multiple certificates and more complex data\n
    \  structures.\n\n   This document provide the description of the definition and
    encoding\n   rules for CompositeKey and CompositeSignature.  A description of
    how\n   to use these structures in main PKIX objects (e.g., X.509\n   certificates,
    CRLs, OCSP responses, etc.) is also provided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
