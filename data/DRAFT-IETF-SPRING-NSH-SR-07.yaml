abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the integration of Network Service
    Header\n   (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to\n
    \  support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while\n   maintaining
    separation of the service and transport planes as\n   originally intended by the
    SFC architecture.\n\n   Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for
    steering\n   packets between Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given\n
    \  Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH has the responsibility for\n   maintaining
    the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance\n   context, and any associated
    metadata.\n\n   The integration described in this document demonstrates that NSH
    and\n   SR can work jointly and complement each other leaving the network\n   operator
    with the flexibility to use whichever transport technology\n   makes sense in
    specific areas of their network infrastructure, and\n   still maintain an end-to-end
    service plane using NSH.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
