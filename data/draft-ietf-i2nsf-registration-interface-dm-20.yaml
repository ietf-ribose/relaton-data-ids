abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an information model and a YANG data model for
    Registration Interface between Security Controller and Developer's Management
    System (DMS) in the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework
    to register Network Security Functions (NSF) of the DMS with the Security Controller.
    The objective of these information and data models is to support NSF capability
    registration and query via I2NSF Registration Interface.</p>"
