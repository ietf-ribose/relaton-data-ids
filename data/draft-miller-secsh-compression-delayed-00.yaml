abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new compression method for the SSH protocol.
    This new method uses the same zlib compression algorithm as the existing method
    described in the core SSH drafts but delays the start of compression until after
    user authentication has completed. This eliminates the risk of a bug in compression
    libraries resulting in a pre-authentication compromise of an SSH server.</p>"
