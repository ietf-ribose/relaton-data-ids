abstract:
- content: "<p>With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scale
    SPs are now faced with the only real option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner.
    In order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should be introduced
    for different deployment models. Among different IPv6 transition mechanisms, dIVI
    is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping method which can directly translate
    IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet. This document describes the challenges and requirements
    for large SP to deploy IPv6 in operational network, the experimental results of
    dIVI in our laboratory and the considerations for dIVI deployment in large SP
    operational network.</p>"
