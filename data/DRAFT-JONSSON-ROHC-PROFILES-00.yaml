abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The RObust Header Compression WG (ROHC) is developing compression\nschemes
    initially for IP/UDP/RTP header compression [ROHC]. The group\nis also chartered
    to develop compression for IP/TCP and after re-\nchartering it is possible (probable)
    that also compression of other\nprotocols will follow. Compression and decompression
    must always\nfollow well defined rules but there exist a number of variables that\nwill
    affect details in the way compression should be carried out and\nhow these rules
    are set. The purpose of this document is to identify\nsuch variables and outline
    a way to make ROHC both adaptable to\nvarious conditions and possible to extend
    for future needs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
