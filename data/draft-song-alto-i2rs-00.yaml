abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the scenarios that applications can use the
    network layer especially the network routing system exposed information, so as
    to optimize application layer traffic. The use cases in this document include
    the ISP broadband network (using P2P and CDN as examples) and the data center
    network. And this document also describes which information should be collected
    for ALTO[I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] service, and eventually optimize the traffic.</p>"
