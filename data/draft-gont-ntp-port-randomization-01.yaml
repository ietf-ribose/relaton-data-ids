abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes. Some of these
    modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and therefore require the
    use of a service/well-known port as the local port number. However, in the case
    of NTP modes where the use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing
    such well-known/ service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers
    to perform blind/off-path attacks, since knowledge of such port number is typically
    required for such attacks. This document formally updates RFC5905, recommending
    the use of port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP service port
    is not required.</p>"
