abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet connectivity and use of data services in 3GPP based mobile\nnetworks
    has increased rapidly as a result of smart phones, broadband\nservice via HSPA
    and HSPA+ networks, competitive service offerings by\noperators and a large number
    of applications.  Operators who have\ndeployed networks based on 3GPP architectures
    are facing IPv4 address\nshortages.  With the impending exhaustion of available
    IPv4 addresses\nfrom the registries there is an increased emphasis for operators
    to\nmigrate to IPv6.  This document describes the support for IPv6 in\n3GPP network
    architectures.\n\t </p>\n      "
