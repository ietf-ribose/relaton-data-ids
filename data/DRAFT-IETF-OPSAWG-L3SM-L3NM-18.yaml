abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As a complement to the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service
    YANG\n   data Model (L3SM), used for communication between customers and\n   service
    providers, this document defines an L3VPN Network YANG Model\n   (L3NM) that can
    be used for the provisioning of Layer 3 Virtual\n   Private Network (VPN) services
    within a service provider network.\n   The model provides a network-centric view
    of L3VPN services.\n\n   L3NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive
    the\n   configuration information that will be sent to relevant network\n   devices.
    \ The model can also facilitate the communication between a\n   service orchestrator
    and a network controller/orchestrator.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
