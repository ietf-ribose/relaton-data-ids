abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) being specified jointly by
    IETF\nand ITU-T includes requirements documents and framework documents.\nThe
    framework documents define the basic architecture that is needed\nin order to
    support various aspects of the required behavior.  This\ndocument addresses the
    functionality described in the MPLS-TP\nSurvivability Framework document and defines
    a protocol that may be\nused to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination
    for\nlinear protection, as described in that document.\n\nThis document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an
    MPLS Transport\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\ncapabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\ndefined
    by the ITU-T.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF
    in full conformance with the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.\n\nInternet-Drafts
    are working documents of the Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF), its areas,
    and its working groups.  Note that\nother groups may also distribute working documents
    as Internet-\nDrafts.\n\nInternet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum
    of six months\nand may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at
    any\ntime.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference\nmaterial
