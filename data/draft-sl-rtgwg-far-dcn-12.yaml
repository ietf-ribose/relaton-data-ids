abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a generic routing method and protocol for a regular
    data center network, named as fault-avoidance routing (FAR) protocol. FAR protocol
    provides a generic routing method for all types of regular topology network architectures
    that are proposed for large-scale cloud-based data centers over the past few years.
    FAR protocol is well designed to fully leverage the regularity in the topology
    and compute its routing table in a simplistic manner. Fat- tree is taken as an
    example architecture to illustrate how FAR protocol can be applied in real operational
    scenarios.</p>"
