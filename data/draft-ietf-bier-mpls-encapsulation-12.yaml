abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building
    protocol. When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines
    the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router
    then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bit
    string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to
    forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to
    those routers are set in the BIER header. The details of the encapsulation depend
    on the type of network used to realize the multicast domain. This document specifies
    a BIER encapsulation that can be used in an MPLS network or, with slight differences,
    in a non-MPLS network.</p>
