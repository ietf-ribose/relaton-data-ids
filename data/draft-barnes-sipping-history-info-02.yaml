abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history information
    associated with a SIP request. This capability enables many enhanced services
    by providing the information as to how and why a call arrives at a specific application
    or user. This draft defines a new optional SIP header, History-Info, for capturing
    the history information in requests. A new option tag, HistInfo, to be included
    in the Supported header is defined to allow UAs to indicate whether the HistInfo
    should be returned in responses to a request which has captured the history information.</p>"
