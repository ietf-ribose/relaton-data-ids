abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol defines a way to
    establish\n   IPsec security association between two end points.  Normally the\n
    \  protocol requires a single authentication step to complete the\n   exchange
    and establish IPsec security association between the end\n   points.  However,
    there are situations were more than one\n   authentication exchange is required
    potentially with different\n   authenticating domains.  It is also possible that
    multiple\n   authentication steps are performed to authenticate the endpoints
    for\n   different services with different traffic selectors.  This document\n
    \  proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to achieve this goal with a\n   single
    IKE SA.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
