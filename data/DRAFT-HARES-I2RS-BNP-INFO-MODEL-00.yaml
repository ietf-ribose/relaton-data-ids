abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains three information Models: Basic Network
    Policy\n   (BNP IM).  ACLs do not provide all the policy support required by\n
    \  BGP, Policy Based Routing (PBR), SFC Topology Information Model (SF-\n   Topo
    IM), Service Forwarding Chaing IM (SFC IM), and and flow\n   specification filtering.
    \ The BNP IM has the following top-down\n   levels of Policy Hierarchy: Policy
    Set, Policy Group, Policy Rule,\n   and conditional actions within the policy
    rule (conditional match and\n   Actions).  These can be used in PBR-RIB or BGP
    to provide an ordered\n   set of policy rules grouped with a Policy Group via
    operators (AND,\n   OR, etc.) and ordered by a combination of priority and precedence.\n
    \  The Policy is an ordered set of Policy Groups.\n\n   The BNP IM is based on
    the concept of an extensible information model\n   for representing policies.
    \ This concept is also found in the Policy\n   Core Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060)
    and the Quality of Service\n   (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644)
    and policy based\n   routing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
