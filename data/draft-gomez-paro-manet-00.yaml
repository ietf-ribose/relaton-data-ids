abstract:
  content: "<p>Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preservebattery
    power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power savingtechniques during
    operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO,a Power-Aware Routing Optimization
    protocol that minimizes thetransmission power necessary to forward packets between
    wirelessdevices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets betweensource-destination
    pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmissionpower consumed by wireless devices.
    An important property of PARO isthat it outperforms traditional broadcast-based
    routing protocols dueto its power efficient point-to-point on-demand nature. The
    protocolis designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop routing protocol forlocal-area
    wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks, single-hop sensor networks,
    WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancementfor routing in wide-area MANETs.</p>"
