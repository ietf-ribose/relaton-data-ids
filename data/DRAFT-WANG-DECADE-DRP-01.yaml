abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explorers the design of an HTTP-based DECADE
    Resource\n   Protocol (DRP), which can be used for content and resource management\n
    \  between a DECADE Client and a DECADE Server, or between two DECADE\n   Servers.
    \ We identify the function entities, and present initial\n   protocol message
    flow and syntax design.  The purpose of this\n   document is to get design discussion
    started, not to provide a\n   complete solution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
