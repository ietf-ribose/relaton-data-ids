abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) uses a Rendezvous
    Point (RP) and shared trees to forward multicast packets from new sources. Once
    Last-Hop Routers (LHRs) receive packets from a new source, they may join the Shortest
    Path Tree (SPT) for the source for optimal forwarding. This document defines a
    new mechanism that provides a way to support PIM-SM without the need for PIM registers,
    RPs, or shared trees. Multicast source information is flooded throughout the multicast
    domain using a new generic PIM Flooding Mechanism (PFM). This allows LHRs to learn
    about new sources without receiving initial data packets.</p>"
