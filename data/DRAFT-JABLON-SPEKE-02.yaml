abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes SPEKE, B-SPEKE, and SRP-4, three methods
    for\npassword-based key agreement and authentication.  In the same class\nof techniques
    as SRP-3 [RFC 2945], these methods provide a zero-\nknowledge proof of a password
    and authenticate session keys over an\nunprotected channel, with minimal dependency
    on infrastructure and\nproper user behavior.  These methods are compatible with
    IEEE 1363\nand ANSI X9 standards, and are closely aligned with RFC 2945 from an\napplication
    perspective.  They use different techniques than earlier\npatented alternatives,
    and provide an expanded set of choices for\nconvenient and secure personal authentication
    over the Internet.\n\t </p>\n      "
