abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces the concept of Mirror Proxy that enables\n
    \  sleeping devices to participate in a REST architecture despite the\n   fact
    that they are not web servers.  Most constrained devices may\n   sleep during
    long periods preventing them from acting as traditional\n   web servers.  However
    as client-only endpoints they can rely on a\n   Mirror Proxy to cache and serve
    the content they provide.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
