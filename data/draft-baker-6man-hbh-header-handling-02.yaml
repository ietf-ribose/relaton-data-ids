abstract:
- content: "<p>This note updates the IPv6 Specification (RFC 2460), specifically commenting
    on the Hop-by-Hop Options Header (section 4.3) and option format and handling
    (section 4.2). It also updates RFC 7045, which noted that RFC 2460 is widely violated
    in this respect, but merely legitimized this situation with a SHOULD. The present
    document tries to address the issue more fundamentally. It tries to address the
    issue.</p>"
