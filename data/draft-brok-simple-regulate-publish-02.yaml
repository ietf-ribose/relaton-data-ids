abstract:
  content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event StatePublication
    describes a mechanism for a User Agent Client (UAC) topublish event state information
    to a User Agent Server (UAS).Generally, the UAC is free to monitor certain resources
    at a certainrate and publish changes of their event state, for instance with thepresence
    event package. However, for a UAC on a mobile device, thiscan be very costly in
    terms of battery, computing, and networkresources. Although some mechnisms exist
    for a UAC to deduce whetherevent state publication is needed and at what rate
    publish messagesmay be sent, these are rather coarse and reactive in nature. Thismemo
    defines a solution for a UAS to regulate monitoring andpublications by providing
    detailed information to the UAC regardingwhich resources to monitor, at what rate,
    whether urgent and withwhat delta.</p>"
