abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected
    as a\n   Designated Router (DR).  On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is\n   responsible
    for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding\n   traffic to these listeners
    if the group is operating in PIM-SM.  In\n   case of a network maintenance, where
    we want to bring down the\n   current DR, there is currently no way to gracefully
    handover the PIM\n   DR role to a new DR on the shared LAN.  In this document,
    we propose\n   a modification to the PIM-SM protocol that allows PIM DR to\n   gracefully
    shutdown or go down for maintenance.  We also provide a\n   procedure for PIM
    DR to gracefully handover its role to a new PIM DR\n   in the network.\n\n\t </p>\n
