abstract:
- content: "<p>The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG, and some members
    of the IETF LLC are selected, confirmed, and recalled is specified in this document.
    This document is a self-consistent, organized compilation of the process as it
    was known at the time of publication of RFC 3777, with various updates since that
    version was published. This document obsoletes RFC7437.</p>"
