abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple
    paths to\n   a regular TCP session and is being deployed extensively.  Source\n
    \  Address Validation (SAV) technologies are proposed to prevent network\n   nodes
    from spoofing others' IP addresses and thus improve the\n   accountability of
    networks.  This document proposes a trusted MPTCP\n   extension based on SAV,
    which enables MPTCP to work with SAV and thus\n   improve the accountability of
    MPTCP connections.  This extension\n   doesn't intend to replace the security
    solutions to resolving IP\n   forged attacks, like Hash-based Message Authentication
    Code (HMAC),\n   but to improve the accountability of them and the whole connection.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
