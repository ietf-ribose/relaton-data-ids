abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex\ngrowth
    of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along\nthe Core network,
    is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly\nderived from a \"Network-Oriented
    point of view\", and therefore a\ngeneral perspective, not focused on specific
    services - with some more\nPerformance factors, so to include a \"Service-Oriented
    point of view\",\nmore centred on the particular kind of service, with its own\ncharacteristics
    in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and\nso on.\nAlmost nothing
    about this new approach has been standardized yet for\nthe core network.\nTo achieve
    the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group\nperformance metrics outlined
    in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics\ncomposition/aggregation framework is proposed
    in this memo, where the\nmain focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video
    providers,\nonline biding, online stock market, etc.).\nFinally this memo is tuned
    to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,\nframework concepts, and need to widen
    the current performance metrics\ndepending on the application, service etc.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
