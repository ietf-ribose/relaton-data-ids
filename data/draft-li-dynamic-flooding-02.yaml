abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing with link state protocols in dense network topologies can result
    in sub-optimal convergence times due to the overhead associated with flooding.
    This can be addressed by decreasing the flooding topology so that it is less dense.
    This document discusses the problem in some depth and an architectural solution.
    Specific protocol changes are not described in this document.</p>"
