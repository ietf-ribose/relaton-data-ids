- content: "<p>In IPv6 networks Router Advertisements can be used for providing common
    configuration information to nodes that are attached. There are some scenarios
    where it is advantageous for routers to provide their uplink access technology
    information to attached hosts. This document describes a neighbor discovery option
    that will allow the routers to do so.</p>"
