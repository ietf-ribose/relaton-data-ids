abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses two categories of inter-connections
    of\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPN and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. In the first\n   category,
    DC overlay virtual network is built with BGP/MPLS IP VPN\n   (IP VPN) technologies,
    and the inter-connection of IP VPN in the DC\n   either to IP VPN in other DCs
    or to IP VPN in the WAN enables end-to-\n   end IP VPN connectivity. In the second
    category, DC overlay network\n   uses non IP VPN overlay technologies, and the
    inter-connection of any\n   overlay virtual network in the DC to IP VPN in the
    WAN provides end\n   user connectivity through stitching of different overlay\n
    \  technologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
