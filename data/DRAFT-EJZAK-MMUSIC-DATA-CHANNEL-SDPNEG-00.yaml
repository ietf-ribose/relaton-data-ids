abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each
    data channel might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.
    \ Data channel setup\n   can be done using either the in-band WebRTC Data Channel
    protocol or\n   some external (in-band or out-of-band) negotiation.  This document\n
    \  specifies how the SDP offer/answer exchange can be used to achieve\n   such
    an external negotiation.  Even though data channels are designed\n   for RTCWeb
    use initially they may be used by other protocols like,\n   but not limited to,
    the CLUE protocol.  This document is intended to\n   be used whereever data channels
    are used.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
