abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines the terminology, problem statement, and requirements
    for implementing Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IPsec on clusters. It also describes
    gaps in existing standards and their implementation that need to be filled in
    order to allow peers to interoperate with clusters from different vendors. Agreed
    upon terminology, problem statement, and requirements will allow IETF working
    groups to consider development of IPsec/IKEv2 mechanisms to simplify cluster implementations.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
