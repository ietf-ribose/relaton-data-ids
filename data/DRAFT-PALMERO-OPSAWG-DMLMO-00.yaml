abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document motivates and specifies a data model for lifecycle\n
    \  management and operations.  It describes the motivation and\n   requirements
    to collect asset-centric metrics including but not\n   limited to asset adoption
    and usability, licensing, supported\n   features and capabilities, enabled features
    and capabilities, etc.;\n   with the primary objective to measure and improve
    the overall user\n   experience along the lifecycle journey, from technical requirements\n
    \  and technology selection through advocacy and renewal, including the\n   end
    of life of an asset.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
