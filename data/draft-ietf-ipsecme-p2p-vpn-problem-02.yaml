abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of systems
    to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic between them. It them
    expands on the requirements, for such a solution. Manual configuration of all
    possible tunnels is too cumbersome in many such cases. In other cases the IP address
    of end points change or the end points may be behind NAT gateways, making static
    configuration impossible. The Auto Discovery VPN solution is chartered to address
    these requirements.</p>"
