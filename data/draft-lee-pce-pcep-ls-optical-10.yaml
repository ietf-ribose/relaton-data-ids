abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Traditionally
    this Link State and TE information has been obtained from a link state routing
    protocol (supporting traffic engineering extensions). This document extends the
    Path Communication Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) with Link-State and TE
    information for optical networks.</p>"
