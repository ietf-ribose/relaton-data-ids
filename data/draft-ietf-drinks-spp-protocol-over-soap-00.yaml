abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) is an XML framework
    that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data into Session
    Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores. Sending XML data structures
    over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto
    standard for messaging between elements of provisioning systems. Therefore the
    combination of SOAP and HTTP(s) as a transport protocol for SPPF is a natural
    fit. The obvious benefits include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveraging
    existing standards, and a higher probability that existing provisioning systems
    can be more easily integrated with this protocol. This document describes the
    specification for transporting SPPF XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).</p>"
