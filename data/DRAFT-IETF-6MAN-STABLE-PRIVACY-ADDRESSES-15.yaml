abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface\n
    \  Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n   (SLAAC),
    such that addresses configured using this method are stable\n   within each subnet,
    but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts\n   move from one network to another.
    \ This method is meant to be an\n   alternative to generating Interface Identifiers
    based on hardware\n   addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN MAC addresses), such that the
    benefits of\n   stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy
    of\n   users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes\n
    \  a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique-\n   local
    addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
