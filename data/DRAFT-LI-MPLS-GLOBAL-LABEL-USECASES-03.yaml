abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As the MPLS technologies develop, MPLS label is not only used
    with\n   the local meaning which is always be understood by the upstream node\n
    \  and the downstream node, but also used with the global meaning which\n   can
    be understood by all nodes or part of nodes in the network.  The\n   document
    defines the latter as the global label and proposes the\n   possible use cases
    of global label.  In these usecases MPLS global\n   label can be used for location
    identification, VPN identification,\n   segment routing, etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
