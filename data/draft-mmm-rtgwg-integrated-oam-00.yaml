abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the Integrated Operation, Administration, and
    Maintenance (IntOAM) protocol. IntOAM is based on the lightweight capabilities
    of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection defined in RFC 5880 Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection, and the RFC 6374 Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks
    to measure performance metrics like packet loss and packet delay. Also, a method
    to perform lightweight on-demand authentication is defined in this specification.</p>"
