abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in communication
    services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as the signaling protocol for
    multimedia applications on the Internet. Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility
    management scheme that utilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well
    as other protocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.</p>"
