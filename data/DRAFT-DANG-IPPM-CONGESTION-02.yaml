abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo defines a metric for one path congestion across Internet\n
    \  paths.  The traditional mode evaluates network congestion based on\n   the
    bandwidth utilization of the link.  However, there is a lack of\n   E2E path congestion
    that is truly service oriented.  So A Path\n   Congestion Metric is required.\n\n\t
