abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level\n
    \  encryption of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security\n   standpoint
    as it might be because of its opportunistic nature;\n   message delivery is prioritized
    over security.  This document\n   describes a complementary option, REQUIRETLS,
    which causes message\n   delivery to fail if a TLS connection with the required
    security\n   characteristics cannot be negotiated with the next hop MTA or if
    that\n   MTA does not also support REQUIRETLS.  Message originators may\n   therefore
    expect transport security for messages sent with this\n   option.\n\n\t </p>\n
