abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides a simple mechanism to prevent an attacker
    from\n   presenting a forged \"From\" header field.  It offers an end-to-end\n
    \  identity assumption which does not require any previous association\n   or
    trust relationship between administrative domains or the UAs.  The\n   UAS verifies
    the \"From\" header by subscribing to the Dialog Event\n   package [RFC 4235]
    at the AOR in the \"From\" header field.  If the\n   entity calling is registered
    under this AOR, it will confirm that it\n   is calling by sending some valid dialog
    state.  In this case, the\n   identity of the caller is considered to be verified.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
