abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies the use of identity as a raw public key in
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). The
    protocol procedures are kept unchanged, but cipher suites are extended to support
    Identity-based signature (IBS). The example OID tables in the RFC 7250 [RFC7250]
    are expanded with OIDs specific to the IBC-based signature algorithms.</p>"
