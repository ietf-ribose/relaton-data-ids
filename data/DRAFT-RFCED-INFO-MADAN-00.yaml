abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BOOTP [1] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    [2]\n   provide a framework for booting a host over a network from a remote\n
    \  server. This document defines a new option which a BOOTP/DHCP client\n   may
    include in its BOOTP request or DHCPDISCOVER message. In their\n   replies, the
    \ recipient servers may include this option  along with\n   the location/path
    information to a file ('boot.info') in the option\n   field. The client may use
    the contents of this file to select the\n   desired  OS  with which to boot along
    with the location/path of the\n   appropriate boot image file.\n\t </p>\n      "
