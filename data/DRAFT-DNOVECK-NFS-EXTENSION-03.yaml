abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document surveys the processes by which the NFS protocol
    has\n   been extended in the past, including all of the NFS major and minor\n
    \  versions.  It also looks forward to methods of protocol extension\n   that
    might be used by NFS in the future.\n\n   A particular focus is on how the minor
    versioning model of NFSv4 has\n   worked and what is being done to enhance version
    management within\n   NFSv4.  The work already done in the new NFSv4 version management\n
    \  document is summarized, and there is a discussion of further issues\n   the
    working group will need to address in moving that work forward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
