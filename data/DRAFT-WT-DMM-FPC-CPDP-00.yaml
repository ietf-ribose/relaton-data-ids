abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The specification as per this document supports the separation
    of the\n   Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the actual\n
    \  Data-Plane.  The protocol semantics abstract from the actual details\n   for
    the configuration of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client\n   function,
    which is used by an application of the mobility Control-\n   Plane, and an Agent
    function, which is associated with the\n   configuration of Data-Plane nodes according
    to the policies issued by\n   the mobility Control-Plane.  The scope of the policies
    comprises\n   forwarding rules and treatment of packets in terms of encapsulation,\n
    \  IP address re-writing and QoS.  Additional protocol semantics are\n   described
    to support the maintenance of the Data-Plane path.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
