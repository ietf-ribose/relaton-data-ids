abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the Prefix Delegation (PD) option used to\ndelegate
    IPv6 address space to simple IPv6 sites.  The PD option,\nwhich lists the global
    prefixes that a site may use to number its\nnetwork, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery Router Advertisement\nmessages that are sent across a point-to-point
    link from a provider's\nrouter to a site's border router.  This document defines
    the\nmechanism by which a site router processes the PD option and\nconfigures
    each of its attached links allowing hosts within the site\nto obtain global addresses
    using address autoconfiguration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
