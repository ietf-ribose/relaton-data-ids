abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes
    TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections. In the current TCP specification ([RFC0793]),
    there are some inappropriate or not up-to-date functions. Here we focus and discuss
    on TCP TIME-WAIT state function. TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connections
    of Active Close side nodes. After TCP connections are effectively closed, state
    of them move to TIME-WAIT state. After TIME-WAIT state is finished, resources
    of connections are released. This means that even if connections are effectively
    finished, resources of connections are NOT released. The TIME-WAIT state prevents
    from releasing them. From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity
    communication styles, it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of evil functions.
    In order to provide efficient communications that match current styles, an idea
    "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME- WAIT state of TCP connections
    is proposed.</p>
