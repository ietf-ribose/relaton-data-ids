abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ISO/IEC 10646 defines a multi-octet character set called the\n
    \  Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's\n   writing
    systems.  Multi-octet characters, however, are not compatible\n   with many current
    applications and protocols, and this has led to the\n   development of a few so-called
    UCS transformation formats (UTF), each\n   with different characteristics.  UTF-9,
    the object of this memo, has\n   the characteristic of preserving the full ISO-Latin1
    range, providing\n   compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software
    that rely\n   on ISO-Latin1 values.\n \n   ISO-Latin1 is almost as widespread
    as ASCII in many countries,\n   especially in most of western Europe, and is the
    default character\n   set for HTML.  A compatible encoding seems desirable, where
    possible.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
