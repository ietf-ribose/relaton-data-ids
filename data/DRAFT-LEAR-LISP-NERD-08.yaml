abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow
    end\nsites to multihome without injecting routes from one end of the\nInternet
    to another.  This memo presents an experimental database and\na discussion of
    methods to transport the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs to\nrouters in a reliable, scalable,
    and secure manner.  Our analysis\nconcludes that transport of of all EID/RLOC
    mappings scales well to\nat least 10^8 entries.\n\t </p>\n      "
