abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for performing\nmutual
    authentication as well as establishing and maintaining\nsecurity associations
    (SAs) between two parties such as a user and a\nnetwork entity.  Internet Key
    Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol allows\nseveral different mechanisms for authenticating
    a user, namely the\nExtensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared\nsecrets.
    \ To authenticate and/or authorize the user, the network\nelement such as the
    Access Gateway may need to dynamically bootstrap\na security association based
    on interaction with the Diameter server.\nThis document specifies the interaction
    between the Access Gateway\nand Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared
    secrets.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
