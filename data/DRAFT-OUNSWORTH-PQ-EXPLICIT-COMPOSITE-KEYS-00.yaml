abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will
    come\n   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum
    algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to
    be performed in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the
    component algorithms individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for
    holding composite public\n   keys and composite signature data.  This draft defines
    a structure\n   generic enough to be useful beyond the post-quantum transition
    for\n   any situation where a widely-supported but untrusted algorithm is\n   being
    migrated to newer cryptography.\n\n   This document defines structures for binding
    an explicit pair of\n   cryptographic algorithms together into a single object
    identifier,\n   and it provides ASN.1 structures for encoding these pairwise\n
    \  composite public keys, private keys in wire protocols, as well as\n   using
    them in conjunction with composite signatures, encryption and\n   key transport
    mechanisms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
