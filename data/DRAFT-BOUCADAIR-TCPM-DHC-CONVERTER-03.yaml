abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Because of the lack of important TCP extensions, e.g., Multipath
    TCP\n   support at the server side, some service providers now consider a\n   network-assisted
    model that relies upon the activation of a dedicated\n   function called Transport
    Converters.  For example, network-assisted\n   Multipath TCP deployment models
    are designed to facilitate the\n   adoption of Multipath TCP for the establishment
    of multi-path\n   communications without making any assumption about the support
    of\n   Multipath TCP by the remote servers.  Transport Converters located in\n
    \  the network are responsible for establishing multi-path\n   communications
    on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of\n   Multipath TCP capabilities
    to achieve different goals that include\n   (but are not limited to) optimization
    of resource usage (e.g.,\n   bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup\n
    \  communication paths), and traffic offload management.\n\n   This document focuses
    on the explicit deployment scheme where the\n   identity of the Transport Converters
    is explicitly configured on\n   connected hosts.  This document specifies DHCP
    (IPv4 and IPv6)\n   options to configure hosts with Converters parameters.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
