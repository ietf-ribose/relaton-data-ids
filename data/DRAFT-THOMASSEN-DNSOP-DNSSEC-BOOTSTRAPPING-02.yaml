abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces an in-band method for DNS operators
    to\n   publish arbitrary information about the zones they are authoritative\n
    \  for, in an authenticated fashion and on a per-zone basis.  The\n   mechanism
    allows managed DNS operators to securely announce DNSSEC\n   key parameters for
    zones under their management, including for zones\n   that are not currently securely
    delegated.\n\n   Whenever DS records are absent for a zone's delegation, this
    signal\n   enables the parent's registry or registrar to cryptographically\n   validate
    the CDS/CDNSKEY records found at the child's apex.  The\n   parent can then provision
    DS records for the delegation without\n   resorting to out-of-band validation
    or weaker types of cross-checks\n   such as \"Accept after Delay\" ([RFC8078]).\n\n
    \  [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information,
    answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be
