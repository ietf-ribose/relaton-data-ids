abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC8280] has identified and documented important principles,
    such as\n   Data Minimization, End-to-End, and Interoperability in order to\n
    \  enable access to fundamental Human Rights.  While (partial)\n   implementations
    of these concepts are already available, many current\n   applications lack Privacy
    support that the average user can easily\n   navigate.  This document covers analysis
    of threats to privacy and\n   security and derives requirements from this threat
    analysis.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
