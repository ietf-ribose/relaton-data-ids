abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an optimization for MLDv1 (RFC 2710)
    and\n   MLDv2 (RFC 3810).\n   As per this optimization, a new router on coming
    up will not send\n   periodic \"General Query\" messages to get the list of multicast\n
    \  listeners. Instead, it will try to get the same from the Querier on\n   the
    link. Only if no Querier are present on the link, will the new\n   router move
    to Querier state and send \"General Query\" messages.\n   This approach provides
    an advantage in eliminating possibly large\n   number of \"Multicast Listener
    Report\" messages every time a new\n   router comes up on a link. More the number
    of listeners on a link,\n   more the advantage.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
