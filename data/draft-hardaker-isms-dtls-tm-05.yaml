abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple NetworkManagement
    Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport LayerSecurity protocol or the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)protocol. The TLS and DTLS protocols provide
    authentication andprivacy services for SNMP applications. This document describes
    howthe TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of aSNMP Transport
    Subsystem to make this protection possible in aninteroperable way.This transport
    model is designed to meet the security and operationalneeds of network administrators.
    The TLS mode can make use of TCP'simproved support for larger packet sizes and
    the DTLS mode providespotentially superior operation in environments where a connectionless(e.g.
    UDP or SCTP) transport is preferred. Both TLS and DTLSintegrate well into existing
    public keying infrastructures.This document also defines a portion of the Management
    InformationBase (MIB) for monitoring and managing the TLS Transport Model forSNMP.</p>"
