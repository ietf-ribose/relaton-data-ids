abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Data Centre TCP (DCTCP) was designed to provide predictably
    low\n   queuing latency, near-zero loss, and throughput scalability using\n   explicit
    congestion notification (ECN) and an extremely simple\n   marking behaviour on
    switches.  However, DCTCP does not co-exist with\n   existing TCP traffic---DCTCP
    is so aggressive that existing TCP\n   algorithms approach starvation.  So, until
    now, DCTCP could only be\n   deployed where a clean-slate environment could be
    arranged, such as\n   in private data centres.  This specification defines `DualQ
    Coupled\n   Active Queue Management (AQM)' to allow scalable congestion controls\n
    \  like DCTCP to safely co-exist with classic Internet traffic.  The\n   Coupled
    AQM ensures that a flow runs at about the same rate whether\n   it uses DCTCP
    or TCP Reno/Cubic, but without inspecting transport\n   layer flow identifiers.
    \ When tested in a residential broadband\n   setting, DCTCP achieved sub-millisecond
    average queuing delay and\n   zero congestion loss under a wide range of mixes
    of DCTCP and\n   `Classic' broadband Internet traffic, without compromising the\n
    \  performance of the Classic traffic.  The solution also reduces\n   network
    complexity and eliminates network configuration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
