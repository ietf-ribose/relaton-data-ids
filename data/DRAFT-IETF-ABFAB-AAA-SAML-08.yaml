abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the use of the Security Assertion Mark-up\n
    \  Language (SAML) with RADIUS in the context of the ABFAB architecture.\n   It
    defines two RADIUS attributes, a SAML binding, a SAML name\n   identifier format,
    two SAML profiles, and two SAML confirmation\n   methods.  The RADIUS attributes
    permit encapsulation of SAML\n   assertions and protocol messages within RADIUS,
    allowing SAML\n   entities to communicate using the binding.  The two profiles
    describe\n   the application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and\n   assertion
    query/request, enabling a Relying Party to request\n   authentication of, or assertions
    for, user or machine principals.\n   These principals may be named using an NAI
    name identifier format.\n   Finally, the subject confirmation methods allow requests
    and queries\n   to be issued for a previously authenticated user or machine without\n
    \  needing to explicitly identify them as the subject.  These artifacts\n   have
    been defined to permit application in AAA scenarios other than\n   ABFAB, such
    as network access.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
