abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution forname-based
    sockets. Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses,shim6 can handle a more diverse
    set of mobility scenarios. Thesechanges allow a shim6 session to persist even
    through cases where onenode has no working locators to its correspondent node.
    If the nameis also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection canbe
    kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to thecorresponding node.
    As can be the case if both nodes are mobilesimultaneously.</p>"
