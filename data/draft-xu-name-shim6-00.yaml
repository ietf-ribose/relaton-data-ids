abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution for
    name-based sockets. Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses, shim6 can handle
    a more diverse set of mobility scenarios. These changes allow a shim6 session
    to persist even through cases where one node has no working locators to its correspondent
    node. If the name is also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection
    can be kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to the corresponding
    node. As can be the case if both nodes are mobile simultaneously.</p>"
