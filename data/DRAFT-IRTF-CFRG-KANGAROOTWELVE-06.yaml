abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the KangarooTwelve eXtendable Output
    Function\n   (XOF), a hash function with output of arbitrary length.  It provides\n
    \  an efficient and secure hashing primitive, which is able to exploit\n   the
    parallelism of the implementation in a scalable way.  It uses\n   tree hashing
    over a round-reduced version of SHAKE128 as underlying\n   primitive.\n\n   This
    document builds up on the definitions of the permutations and of\n   the sponge
    construction in [FIPS 202], and is meant to serve as a\n   stable reference and
    an implementation guide.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
