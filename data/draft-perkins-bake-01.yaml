abstract:
  content: "<p>A method is proposed for providing key information for use betweena
    mobile node and correspondent node, to be used for the purpose ofauthenticating
    Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates. The key distributionis secure except against man-in-the-middle
    attacks, when theattacker resides along the routing path between the correspondentnode
    and the mobile node's home agent. The key can be used forauthenticating subsequent
    Binding Updates from the same mobile node,substantially reducing the number of
    key establishment cycles neededfor maintaining efficient communication paths between
    the mobile nodeand correspondent node.</p>"
