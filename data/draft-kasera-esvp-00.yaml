abstract:
  content: "<p>This note describes a new IPsec option called EncapsulatingSecurity
    Variable Payload (ESVP) that allows a variable butcontiguous portion of the payload
    received from upper protocollayers to be encrypted/authenticated between the two
    end-points ofa security association. The remaining portion of the payload isleft
    in the clear. The upper layer payload contains the upperlayer protocol headers
    and data. The decision about whichportions of the payload should be available
    as cleartext is takenonly by the end-points of the security association. By leaving
    acertain portion of the payload as cleartext, ESVP provides theoption of encrypting
    and decrypting an IPsec ESVP datagram atother protocol layers to allow limited
    and secure access to thecleartext data at these protocol layers. These layers
    could beterminated inside the network for providing network-based valueadded services
    and performance optimizations. These network-basedvalue added services and performance
    optimizations include policyimplementation and QoS based on packet classification,
    TCPperformance enhancement in the case of wireless networks andfirewall services.</p>"
