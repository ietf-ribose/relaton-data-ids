abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) precondition framework. A connectivity precondition
    can be used to delay session establishment or modification until media stream
    connectivity has been successfully verified. The method of verification may vary
    depending on the type of transport used for the media. For unreliable datagram
    transports such as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or
    control packets. For reliable connection-oriented transports such as TCP, verification
    can be achieved simply by successful connection establishment or by probing the
    connection with data or control packets, depending on the situation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
