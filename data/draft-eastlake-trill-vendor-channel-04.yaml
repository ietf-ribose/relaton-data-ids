abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).
    TRILL includes a general mechanism, called RBridge Channel, for the transmission
    of typed messages between RBridges in the same campus and between RBridges and
    end stations on the same link. This document specifies a method to send vendor
    specific messages over the RBridge Channel facility.</p>"
