abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Security of the IP Network is always one of the primary concerns
    ofthe network design and normally used layered approach. It isrecommended not
    to rely on a single layer of defense, but toconfigure multi-layer security measures.The
    primary purpose of this paper is to propose a simple andeffective solution to
    enhance the security of EDGE devices which areconnected to external users in a
    Service Provider network. MostService Providers commonly use ingress filtering
    as one of themethods to filter traffic to secure edge devices of theirinfrastructure
    from external users. The proposed technique will usea special wildcard mask on
    the network addresses to limit theaccessibility of the Service Provider EDGE devices
    from externalusers. This will greatly enhance the security of the ServiceProvider's
    edge devices from malicious attacks such as Denial ofService (DoS).</p>"
