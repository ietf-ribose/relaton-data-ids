abstract:
  content: "<p>When an RTP receiver joins a primary multicast session, it may needto
    acquire and parse certain Reference Information before it canprocess any data
    sent in the multicast session. Depending on thejoin time, length of the Reference
    Information repetition interval,size of the Reference Information as well as the
    application andtransport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver canusefully
    consume the multicast data, which we refer to as theAcquisition Delay, varies
    and may be large. This is an undesirablephenomenon for receivers that frequently
    switch among differentmulticast sessions, such as video broadcasts.In this document,
    we describe a method using the existing RTP andRTCP protocol machinery that reduces
    the acquisition delay. In thismethod, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying
    the ReferenceInformation to the receiver precedes/accompanies the primarymulticast
    stream. This unicast RTP flow may be transmitted at afaster than natural rate
    to further accelerate the acquisition. Themotivating use case for this capability
    is multicast applicationsthat carry real-time compressed audio and video. However,
    theproposed method can also be used in other types of multicastapplications where
    the acquisition delay is long enough to be aproblem.</p>"
