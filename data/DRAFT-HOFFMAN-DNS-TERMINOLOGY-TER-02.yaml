abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document adds terms and abbreviations to \"DNS Terminology\"
    (RFC\n   8499) that relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as\n
    \  terms and abbreviations for DNS resolution at traditional and non-\n   traditional
    locations.\n\n   [[ This is an early attempt at these terms.  They will probably
    be\n   improved over time. ]]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
