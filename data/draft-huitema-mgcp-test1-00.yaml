abstract:
  content: "<p>The IETF Megaco working group is currently working on defining a proto-col
    for controlling Media Gateways (MG) from external control elementssuch as a Media
    Gateway Controller (MGC). Different models have beenproposed to address this problem,
    and in order to judge the differentmodels, a series of test cases will be considered.
    This document explains how the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) canbe used
    to handle the first test case, which considers a Voice over IPgateway with directly
    subtending DTMF lines placing a call to an H.323client. The document contains
    an introduction with further details onthe test case, two different call flows
    to solve it, followed by theconclusion of the test case. MGCP is defined in a
    companion document[0].</p>"
