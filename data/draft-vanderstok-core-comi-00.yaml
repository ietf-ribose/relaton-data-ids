abstract:
- content: "<p>The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained
    devices. Access to existing MIBs is included. The proposed integration of CoAP
    with SNMP reduces the code size by removing an important part of the SNMP code.
    The draft lists a set of CoMI objects that describe the operational settings of
    the applications on the device. A majority of them is taken over from other drafts
    to provide one uniform CoMI based access. Note Discussion and suggestions for
    improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</p>"
