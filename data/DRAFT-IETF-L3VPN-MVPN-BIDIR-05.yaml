abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast
    in\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  These procedures allow customer multicast data to\n
    \  travel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of\n   multicast
    tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP \"auto-\n   discovery\" routes,
    by means of a BGP attribute known as the \"Provider\n   Multicast Service Interface
    (PMSI) Tunnel attribute\".  Encodings have\n   been defined that allow the PMSI
    Tunnel attribute to identify\n   bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast
    distribution\n   trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide all the necessary\n
    \  procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to support multicast VPNs.\n   This
    document updates RFCs 6513 and 6625 by specifying those\n   procedures.  In particular,
    it specifies the procedures for assigning\n   customer multicast flows (unidirectional
    or bidirectional) to\n   specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider backbone,
    for\n   advertising such assignments, and for determining which flows have\n   been
    assigned to which tunnels.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
