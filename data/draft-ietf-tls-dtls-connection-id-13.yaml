abstract:
  content: <p>This document specifies the Connection ID (CID) construct for the Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol version 1.2. A CID is an identifier carried
    in the record layer header that gives the recipient additional information for
    selecting the appropriate security association. In "classical" DTLS, selecting
    a security association of an incoming DTLS record is accomplished with the help
    of the 5-tuple. If the source IP address and/or source port changes during the
    lifetime of an ongoing DTLS session then the receiver will be unable to locate
    the correct security context. The new ciphertext record format with CID also provides
    content type encryption and record-layer padding.</p>
