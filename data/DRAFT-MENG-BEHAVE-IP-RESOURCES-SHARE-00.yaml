abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a solution to enable IP addresses sharing\n
    \  among multiple CGN devices, including requesting and releasing IP\n   addresses.
    \ Through this solution, the operators can make the dynamic\n   sharing of IP
    addresses, improve the IP address sharing rate, realize\n   resources'optimization,
    provide a more convenient platform for\n   operators to manage of IP address pools.
    \ In addition, due to the\n   unified management of IP addresses from the AAA
    server, CGN device\n   MAY reboot without provisioned IP address pools.\n\n\t
