abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains a phased plan for how providers of email\n
    \  services can effect and manage the transition of email services from\n   IPv4
    to IPv6.  It is expected that this will be effected over a\n   period of years
    and it is unlikely that any transition will\n   completely exclude the ongoing
    possibility of using IPv4 as a\n   transport mechanism for email.  This provides
    one possible\n   implementation plan for transitioning email services on the Internet\n
    \  from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model that suports IPv6.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
