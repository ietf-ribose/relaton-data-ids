abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of the core as well as an edge from IPv4 to
    IPv6. Operators can now continue to support the legacy IPv4, Virtual Private Network
    (VPN)-IPv4, and Multicast VPN-IPv4 customers. This document describes the critical
    use case and OPEX savings of being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange
    usage as a pure transport, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the
    same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session. By doing so, provides for the
    elimination of Dual Stacking on the Provider Edge - Customer Edge connections.
    Thus making the eBGP peering IPv6-ONLY to now carry both IPv4 and IPv6 Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). This document now provides a solution for
    Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that are facing IPv4 address depletion at these
    peering points to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to carry
    IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6 next hop using the
    [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.</p>"
