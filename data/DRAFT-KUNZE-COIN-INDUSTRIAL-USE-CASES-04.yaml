abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of
    deploying\n   functionality on networking devices, such as switches and network\n
    \  interface cards.  While such functionality can be beneficial in\n   several
    contexts, it has to be carefully placed into the context of\n   the general Internet
    communication.  This document discusses some use\n   cases to demonstrate how
    real applications can benefit from COIN and\n   to showcase essential requirements
    that have to be fulfilled by COIN\n   applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
