abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft documents MPLS TE Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol
    \nmodifications extending the current concept of preemption with the goal \nof
    reducing/eliminating traffic disruption of preempted TE LSPs.  Under \npresent
    RSVP-TE signaling methods, LSPs are immediately displaced upon \npreemption.  The
    introduction of a new preemption pending flag helps \nmore gracefully mitigate
    the re-route process of displaced LSPs.  For \nthe brief period soft preemption
    is activated, reservations (though not \nnecessarily traffic levels) are in effect
    overbooked until the LSP can \nbe re-routed.  For this reason, the feature is
    primarily interesting in \npacket oriented MPLS networks with Diffserv and TE
    capabilities. \n\t </p>\n      "
