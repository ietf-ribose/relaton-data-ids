abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the requirements for a MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP). This document is a product of a joint International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include a MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    architecture to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T). This work is based on two sources of requirements,
    MPLS architecture as defined by IETF and packet transport networks as defined
    by ITU-T.</p>"
