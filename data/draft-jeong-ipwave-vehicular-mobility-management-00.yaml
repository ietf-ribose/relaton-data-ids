abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a vehicular mobility management scheme for
    IP-based vehicular networks. The vehicular mobility management scheme takes advantage
    of a vehicular link model based on a multi- link subnet. With a vehicle's mobility
    information (e.g., position, speed, and direction) and navigation path (i.e.,
    trajectory), it can provide a moving vehicle with proactive and seamless handoff
    along with its trajectory.</p>"
