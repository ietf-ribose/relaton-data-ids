abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines three X.509 v3 Certificate Extensions. Thefirst
    binds a list of IP Address blocks to the public key of thesubject of a certificate.
    The second binds a list of AutonomousSystem Numbers to the public key of the subject
    of a certificate.The third binds a BGP Router Identifier and an Autonomous SystemNumber
    to the public key of the subject of a certificate. Thirdparties, e.g., BGP routers,
    may use these certificates to verify thatthe holder of the private key corresponding
    to the public key in thecertificate has been properly authorized to use resources
    specifiedin the certificate extension.</p>"
