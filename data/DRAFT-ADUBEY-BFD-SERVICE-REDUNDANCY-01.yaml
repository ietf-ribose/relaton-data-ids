abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In a data center, when multiple routing/service nodes are providing\n
    \  single active redundancy for a set of L2, L3 and/or L4-L7 services.\n   Both
    non-revertive and revertive fail over modes are required for the\n   services.
    This draft describes a method to achieve the non-revertive\n   and revertive fail
    over modes for services using Bidirectional\n   Forwarding Detection (BFD).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
