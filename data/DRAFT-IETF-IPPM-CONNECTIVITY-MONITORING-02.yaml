abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Within a Segment Routing domain, segment routed measurement
    packets\n   can be sent along pre-determined paths.  This enables new kinds of\n
    \  measurements.  Connectivity monitoring allows to supervise the state\n   and
    performance of a connection or a (sub)path from one or a few\n   central monitoring
    systems.  This document specifies a suitable\n   type-P connectivity monitoring
    metric.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
