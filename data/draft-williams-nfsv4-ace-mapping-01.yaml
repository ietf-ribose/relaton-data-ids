abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents a model for mapping the domain-qualifieduser
    and group names used in the Network File System version 4'sAccess Control List
    (ACL) entries (ACEs) to internal identifierssuch as POSIX UIDs and GIDs, as well
    as reverse mappings as wellas a protocol for effecting such mappings in a consistent
    wayacross a server cluster, site, or entire domain.The main goals of this model
    and protocol are to allow the use ofuser and group names from multiple domains
    to be used in POSIXenvironments as well as enabling multi-protocol fileserverimplementations
    which must support the use of a variety of userand group identifiers.</p>"
