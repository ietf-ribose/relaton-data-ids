abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is desirable that most of IPv6 deployment is based on Dual
    Stack\nIPv4 and IPv6 nodes so that interoperability with the current IPv4\nbased
    Internet be seamless. The 6to4 transition mechanism offers a\nautomated mechanisms
    for addressing an IPv6 site as well as\ninterconnectivity with other IPv6 sites
    when no native IPv6\nconnectivity is available. DSTM provides a mechanism for
    dynamic\nIPv4 address allocation to Dual Stack nodes and a mechanism to send\npackets
    over a network that only supports IPv6 routing. By combining\nthe two mechanisms
    we show how Dual Stack Intranets may be deployed\nwith minimum need for IPv4 address
    space and no native IPv6\nconnectivity.\n\t </p>\n      "
