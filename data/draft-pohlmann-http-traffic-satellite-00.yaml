abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has notreceived
    enough attention. Satellites have an inherentbroadcasting ability useful for transmitting
    Internettraffic. They can send information to many locationssimultaneously depending
    on the coverage beam of thesatellite. The issue of Internet use over satellites
    needsto be addressed so that future implementations of networkingprotocols can
    be used with this medium. The vast majorityof Internet traffic is TCP traffic
    resulting from the HTTPprotocol so this issue will be addressed here. It is hopedthat
    this facilitates the transition from the use ofterrestial networks, to networks
    incorporating satellitelinks.</p>"
