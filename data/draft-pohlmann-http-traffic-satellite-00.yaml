abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has not received enough
    attention. Satellites have an inherent broadcasting ability useful for transmitting
    Internet traffic. They can send information to many locations simultaneously depending
    on the coverage beam of the satellite. The issue of Internet use over satellites
    needs to be addressed so that future implementations of networking protocols can
    be used with this medium. The vast majority of Internet traffic is TCP traffic
    resulting from the HTTP protocol so this issue will be addressed here. It is hoped
    that this facilitates the transition from the use of terrestial networks, to networks
    incorporating satellite links.</p>"
