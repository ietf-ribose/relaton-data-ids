abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To limit the association between a device traffic and its user,\n
    \  client vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When\n   such
    rotation happens, sessions may break, which may affect network\n   efficiency
    and the user experience.  This document lists network\n   services that may be
    affected by such rotation, and examines\n   solutions to maintain user privacy
    while preserving user quality of\n   experience and network operation efficiency.\n\n\t
