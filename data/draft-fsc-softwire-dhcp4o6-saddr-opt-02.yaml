abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically
    configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network. For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function
    with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and deployment scenarios, the operator
    must learn the /128 IPv6 address that the client will use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6
    tunnel. This address, in conjunction with the IPv4 address and the Port Set ID
    allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client are used to create a binding table entry in the
    softwire tunnel concentrator. This memo defines two DHCPv6 options used to communicate
    the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and server. It is designed
    to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation process.</p>"
