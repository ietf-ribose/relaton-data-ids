abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the HIGHT(HIGh security and light weigHT)\n
    \  encryption algorithm, which is suitable for low-resource device.\n   HIGHT
    is a 64-bit block cipher with 128-bit keys. The algorithm\n   consists of round
    functions, key schedule, encryption, and\n   decryption.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
