abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>WIRE extends HTTP with a new type of redirect response that permits
    a\nresolver to explicitly delegate a resolution to other resolvers and\nprotocols.
    WIRE is an effort to make delegation more explicit, redirection\nmore flexible,
    and resolution processes more efficient through the use of\nhints. This document
    defines WIRE and describes the expected behaviors of\nresolvers and clients using
    WIRE. WIRE is an extension of the HyperText\nTransfer Protocol (HTTP), and is
    intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 and\nabove [4][5].\n \nWIRE encourages
    use of long-lived URIs and at the same time supports\nprotocol evolution without
    having to change currently deployed URIs or URI\nschemes. The extension is based
    on a simple URI resolution model that allows\nan application to dynamically request
    metadata describing where and how to\naccess a resource. The model can use any
    generic metadata description\nlanguage (e.g. RDF) and as the metadata itself is
    interpreted as a first\nclass resource, metadata resources are no different than
    any other resource\non the Web.\n\t </p>\n      "
