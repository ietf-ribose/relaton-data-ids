abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains a set of updates to the syntax and transfer
    of\n   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document\n   updates
    RFC 4210, RFC 5912, and RFC 6712.\n\n   The aspects of CMP updated in this document
    are using EnvelopedData\n   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling
    of p10cr messages,\n   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general
    message\n   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,\n
    \  and '.well-known' HTTP path segments.\n\n   To properly differentiate the support
    of EnvelopedData instead of\n   EncryptedValue, the CMP version 3 is introduced
    in case a transaction\n   is supposed to use EnvelopedData.\n\n   CMP version
    3 is introduced to enable signaling support of\n   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue
    and signaling the use of an\n   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf
    messages, as far as\n   needed.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
