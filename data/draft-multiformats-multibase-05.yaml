abstract:
- content: <p>Raw binary data is often encoded using a mechanism that enables the
    data to be included in human-readable text-based formats. This mechanism is often
    referred to as "base-encoding the data". Base- encoding is often used when expressing
    binary data in hyperlinks, cryptographic keys in web pages, or security tokens
    in application software. There are a variety of base-encodings, such as base32,
    base58, and base64. It is not always possible to differentiate one base-encoding
    from another. The purpose of this specification is to provide a mechanism to be
    able to deterministically identify the base-encoding for a particular string of
    data.</p>
