abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failing to respond to queries,
    or responding incorrectly, causes both immediate operational problems and long
    term problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of
    common kinds of queries to which some servers either fail to respond or else respond
    incorrectly. This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other zone operators
    to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem. The document does not look at
    the DNS data itself, just the structure of the responses.</p>"
