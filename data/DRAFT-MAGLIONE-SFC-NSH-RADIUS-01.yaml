abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Service Header (NSH) protocol defines the Service Function\n
    \  Chaining (SFC) encapsulation required to support the Service Function\n   Chaining
    (SFC) Architecture.  One of the components of the Network\n   Service Header (NSH)
    protocol is the Service Path Identifier (SPI),\n   which identifies a service
    path, another important element of the NSH\n   protocol is the Service Index (SI),
    which provides location within\n   the Service Path.\n\n   When Service Providers
    would like to deliver customized services\n   offers requiring Service Functions
    Chains, a different service chain\n   may be required for each subscriber or group
    of subscribers.  In\n   order to simplify the service provisioning in this scenario,
    it would\n   be useful to be able to associate the Service Path Identifier (SPI),\n
    \  identifying the service chain, and the appropriate Service Index\n   (SI),
    identifying the location in the service path, with the customer\n   profile.\n\n
    \  In some Broadband networks, the customer profile information may be\n   stored
    in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n   servers.  This document
    specifies two new Remote Authentication Dial-\n   In User Service (RADIUS) attributes
    to carry the Service Path\n   Identifier (SPI) and the Service Index (SI).\n\n\t
