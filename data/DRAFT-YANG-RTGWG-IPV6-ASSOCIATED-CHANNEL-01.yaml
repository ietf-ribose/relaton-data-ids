abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document introduces a control channel based on IPv6, called\n
    \  Associated CHannel over IPv6 (ACH6), that may carry different types\n   of
    control and management messages.  By using the associated channel,\n   messages
    can be transmitted between network nodes to provide\n   functions like path identification,
    OAM, automatic protection\n   switchover signaling, resource reservation, etc.,
    targeting to\n   provide high quality SLA guarantees to IPv6 services.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
