abstract:
- content: "<p>Providing an early implementation report is important in order to help
    validating a standard before its finalization. This document describes the lessons
    learnt while implementing both an IPFIX probe and collector. Its goals are manifold
    and include feedback to the IPFIX working group, in addition to suggestions for
    tackling open protocol issues that can be addressed in future IPFIX drafts.</p>"
