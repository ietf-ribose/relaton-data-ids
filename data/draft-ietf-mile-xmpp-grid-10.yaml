    Protocol (XMPP) to collect and distribute security incident reports and other
    security-relevant information between network- connected devices, primarily for
    the purpose of communication among Computer Security Incident Response Teams and
    associated entities. To illustrate the principles involved, this document describes
    such a usage for the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF).</p>"
