abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document outlines a set of requirements on a well-behaved
    DNS\n   delegation of a domain name.  A large number of tools have been\n   developed
    to test DNS delegations, but each tool uses a different set\n   of requirements
    for what is a correct setup for a delegated domain\n   name.  However, there are
    few requirements on how to set up DNS in\n   order to just make the delegation
    work.  In order to have a well-\n   behaved delegation that is robust to failures
    and also makes DNS\n   resolvers behave consistently, there are a large number
    of things to\n   consider.\n\n   Based on this document, it should be possible
    to set up a fully\n   functional DNS delegation for a domain name, but also to
    create a set\n   of test specifications for how to test a DNS delegation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
