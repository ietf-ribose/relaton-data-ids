abstract:
- content: <p>NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier versions
    of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key Message Authentication
    Code (MAC) authentication. MACs were first described in Appendix C of RFC 1305
    [RFC1305] and are further described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. As the number of Extension
    Fields grows there is an increasing chance of a parsing ambiguity when deciding
    if the "next" set of data is an Extension Field or a legacy MAC. This proposal
    defines two new Extension Fields to avoid this ambiguity. One, LAST- EF, is used
    to signifiy that it is the last Extension Field in the packet. If the LAST-EF
    is present, any subsequent data MUST be considered to be a legacy MAC. The other,
    MAC-EF, allows one or more MACs to be encapsulated in an Extension Field. If all
    parties in an association support MAC-EF, the use of a legacy MAC may be avoided.</p>
