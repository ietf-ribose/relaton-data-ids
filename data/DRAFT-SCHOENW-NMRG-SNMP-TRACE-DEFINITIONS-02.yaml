abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity
    to\n   collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from\n
    \  operational networks.  To analyze these traces, it is necessary to\n   split
    potentially large traces into more manageable pieces that make\n   it easier to
    deal with large data sets and simplify the analysis of\n   the data.\n\n   This
    document provides some common definitions that have been found\n   useful for
    implementing tools to support trace analysis.  This\n   document mainly serves
    as a reference for the definitions underlying\n   these tools and it is not meant
    to explain all the motivation and\n   reasoning behind the definitions.  Some
    of this background\n   information can be found in other research papers.\n\t
