abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in a multiple
    connection environment. A multiple connection environment consists of multiple-interfaced
    nodes connecting to multiple networks or multiple provisioning domains. Given
    a type of service a multiple-interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress
    ought to return a correct pointer to the service instance that the client is able
    to access without trying every available channel.</p>"
