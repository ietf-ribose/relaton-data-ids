abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) methods
    only\n   allow access to a complete resource.  This does not permit\n   applications
    to access parts of a resource.  In case of resources\n   with larger or complex
    data, or in situations where a resource\n   continuity is required, replacing
    or requesting the whole resource is\n   undesirable.  Several applications using
    CoAP will need to perform\n   partial resource accesses.\n\n   Similar to HTTP,
    the existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n   GET method only allows
    the specification of a URI and request\n   parameters in CoAP options, not the
    transfer of a request payload\n   detailing the request.  This leads to some applications
    to using POST\n   where actually a cacheable, idempotent, safe request is desired.\n\n
    \  Again similar to HTTP, the existing Constrained Application Protocol\n   (CoAP)
    PUT method only allows to replace a complete resource.  This\n   also leads applications
    to use POST where actually a cacheable,\n   possibly idempotent request is desired.\n\n
    \  This specification adds new CoAP methods, FETCH, to perform the\n   equivalent
    of a GET with a request body; and the twin methods PATCH\n   and iPATCH, to modify
    parts of an existing CoAP resource.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
