abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]and
    extended in [CCAMP-SRG] is considered as one of the mostimportant criteria concerning
    the constraint-based path computationof optical channel routes. By applying the
    SRLG disjointnesscriteria to the constraint-based path computation, one can select
    aroute taking into account both resource and logical structuredisjointness. That
    implies a lower probability of simultaneousoptical channel failure.This document
    describes the various physical and logical resourcetypes considered in the SRLG
    concept. The proposed method focuses onthe inference of SRLG information between
    the network physical andlogical layers and the logical structures representing
    geographicallocations. The main applications of the proposed model are relatedto
    the Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm foroptical channel route
    computation and the aggregation of the SRLGinformation flooded throughout traffic
    engineering extensions of theIGP routing protocols (such as OSPF and IS-IS).</p>"
