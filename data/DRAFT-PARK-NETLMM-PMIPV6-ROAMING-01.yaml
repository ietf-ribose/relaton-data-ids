abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service
    to\nmobile nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobile\nnodes
    to be involved in IP mobility management.  In other words, the\nPMIPv6 can transparently
    support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e.\nintra-domain roaming, to mobile
    nodes.  However, if the mobile nodes\nmove to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes
    should have additional\nprotocols for the inter-domain roaming although the domains
    also\nprovide the transparent mobility.  Hence, an inter-domain roaming\nsolution
    would be needed for providing transparent mobility to mobile\nnodes that only
    move around among PMIPv6 domains.  This document\nspecifies the inter-domain roaming
    controlled by the networks\nadopting the PMIPv6.\n\t </p>\n      "
