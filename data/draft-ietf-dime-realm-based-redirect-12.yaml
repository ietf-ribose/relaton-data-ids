abstract:
- content: <p>Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter base
    protocol. In its conventional form, message redirection is performed by an application-independent
    "redirect agent", which returns one or more individual hosts to the message sender
    as possible destinations of the redirected message. However, in some circumstances
    an operator may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying
    individual hosts. This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by
    which that can be achieved when S-NAPTR is not used for dynamic peer discovery.
    New applications may incorporate this capability by reference to the present document.
    Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific, it must be performed
    by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect agent as defined in
    the Diameter base protocol. A new term, "Realm- based Redirect Server", is introduced
    in this document to differentiate the application-specific nature of realm-based
    redirection from the conventional Diameter redirection performed by a basic redirect
    agent. This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to the
    usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs.</p>
