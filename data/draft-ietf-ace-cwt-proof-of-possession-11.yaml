abstract:
- content: <p>This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)
    (which is defined by RFC 8392) that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular
    proof-of-possession key. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes
    described as being the holder-of-key. This specification provides equivalent functionality
    to "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800) but
    using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CWTs rather than JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).</p>
