abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links,
    and\n   these links often define certain expectations about the interactions\n
    \  (such as HTTP methods being used, media types being sent in the\n   request,
    or URI parameters being used in a certain way).  While these\n   expectations
    are essential to define the possible framework for\n   interactions, it may be
    useful to further narrow them down by\n   providing link descriptions, which can
    help clients to gain more\n   runtime knowledge about the resource they are about
    to interact with.\n   This memo defines Link Descriptions, a model and associated
    media\n   type that can be used to describe links by supporting descriptive\n
    \  markup for representing interaction information with links.  Link\n   Descriptions
    can be used by media types (by inclusion or by\n   reference) that seek to make
    Link Descriptions runtime-capable,\n   without having to create their own representation.\n\n\t
