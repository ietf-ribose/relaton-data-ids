abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NPTv6 is a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network
    Prefix\n   Translation function that provides the address-independence benefit\n
    \  associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT without some of that mechanism's\n   drawbacks.
    \ NPTv6 is intended to be deployed in environments where a\n   host might not
    know its \"external\" network prefix(es).  In such an\n   environment, a NPTv6
    device must also translate network prefixes\n   present in in-bound and out-bound
    ICMPv6 error message payloads.\n   This document describes the required processing
    of ICMPv6 error\n   messages.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
