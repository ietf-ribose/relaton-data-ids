abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This proposal introduces a new BGP attribute that can be used
    by BGP\n   routers to advertise their capability to support any kind of host\n
    \  liveliness checking protocols (for example BFD).  This attribute can\n   be
    used to avoid black-holes scenarios seen when BGP next-hop is not\n   the peer,
    in particular on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs)\n   implementing BGP Route-Servers.
    \ IXP member routers can exchange\n   their capability to implement a given host
    liveliness checking\n\nForeword\n\n   A placeholder to list general observations
    about this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
