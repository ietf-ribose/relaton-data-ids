abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the pEp KeySync protocol, which is designed
    to perform secure peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys across devices
    belonging to the same user. Modern users of messaging systems typically have multiple
    devices for communicating, and attempting to use encryption on all of these devices
    often leads to situations where messages cannot be decrypted on a given device
    due to missing private key data. Current approaches to resolve key synchronicity
    issues are cumbersome and potentially insecure. The pEp KeySync protocol is designed
    to facilitate this personal key synchronization in a user-friendly manner.</p>"
