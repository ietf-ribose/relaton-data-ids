abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a multi-domain Internet that offers QoS guaranties for\napplications,
    there is the need of signaling among the domain\nentities that are responsible
    for the management of QoS.  Because\ndifferent domains have different network
    protocols and topologies,\nthe HyPath approach uses the NSIS protocol and interactions
    with the\nlocal routing protocols to have an off-path signaling in hybrid\nenvironments.\n\t
