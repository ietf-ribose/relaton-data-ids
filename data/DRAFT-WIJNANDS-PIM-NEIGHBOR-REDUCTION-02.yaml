abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly\nconnected
    to it on startup.  Networks that are LANs or behave like a\nLAN, potentially create
    many PIM neighbors depending on how many\nrouters are attached to it.  If such
    a LAN is also a transit network\n(no directly connected source or receiver), many
    of the PIM\nprocedures don't apply.  This proposal describes a procedure to\nreduce
    the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.\n\t </p>\n      "
