abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS64 is a widely deployed technology allowing hundreds of
    millions\n   of IPv6-only hosts to reach IPv4-only resources.  DNSSEC is a\n   technology
    used to validate the authenticity of information in the\n   DNS. Currently, there
    are scenarios where DNS64 and DNSSEC do not\n   work well together. This document
    states that any DNSSEC signed\n   resources record should include a native IPv6
    resource record as the\n   most complete and expedient path to solve any deployment
    conflict\n   with DNS64 and DNSSEC.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
