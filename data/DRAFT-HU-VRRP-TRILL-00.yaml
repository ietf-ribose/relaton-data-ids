abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL can be implemented in data center, which is request high\n
    \  reliability and stable, but if RBridge breaks down, the switch time\n   is
    up to IS-IS topology convergence time.  This is not satisfied to\n   the data
    center service.  VRRP provides a redundancy mechanism to\n   avoid single point
    of failure and fast switching over.  This draft\n   proposes to extend VRRP protocol
    to TRILL in data center.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
