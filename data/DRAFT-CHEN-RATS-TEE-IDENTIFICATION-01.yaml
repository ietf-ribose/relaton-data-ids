abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In security considerations, identity of a device should be
    protected\n   and cannot be exposed in public in plaintext.  The storage and\n
    \  execution of identity in device also need to be protected during the\n   lifecycle.
    \ Based on this purpose, this document specifies the\n   architecture of TEE identification
    based on EAP-TLS.  In this\n   architecture, certificate protection and handshake
    keys generation\n   which are used for EAP-TLS authentication will be executed
    in TEE.\n   Communication establishment with EAP-TLS Server will be executed in\n
    \  REE.  A middle layer is introduced to communicate between TEE and REE\n   to
    compose the original function of EAP-TLS Client.\n\n   TEE identification based
    on EAP-TLS could be used in different\n   network layers to implement identity
    authentication.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
