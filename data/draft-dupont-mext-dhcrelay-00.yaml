abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) configuration relies on a prefixdelegation
    service to fulfill its task. Such service has alreadybeen described in two different
    proposals, one is based on DHCPv6 andthe other extends NEMO signaling.However,
    both failed to gather consensus. This memo describes howDHCPv6 Relay Agents can
    be used in order to provide the missingflexibility and pave the way for a solution.</p>"
