abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The iCalendar data format is being updated and included in
    those\n   discussions is the desire to update the time zone information. This\n
    \  is a proposal for time zone updates to iCalendar. The time zone\n   information
    will be available in XML format. To comment on this\n   document send email to
    ietf-calendar@imc.org .\n\n\n   This document also specifies an IANA registration
    process for time\n   zones. No attempt is made to specify any specific time zones
    as that\n   is political information that is out of scope for this document.\n\t
