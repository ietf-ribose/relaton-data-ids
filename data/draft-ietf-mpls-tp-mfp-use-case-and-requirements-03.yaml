abstract:
- content: "<p>For the Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear
    protection capable of 1+1 and 1:1 protection has already been defined. That linear
    protection mechanism has not been designed for handling multiple, simultaneously
    occuring failures, i.e. multiple failures that affect the working and the protection
    entity during the same time period. In these situations currently defined protection
    mechanisms would fail. This document introduces use cases and requirements for
    mechanisms that are capable of protecting against such failures. It does not specify
    a multi-failure protection mechanism itself.</p>"
