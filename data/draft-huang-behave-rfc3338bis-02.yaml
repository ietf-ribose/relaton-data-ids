abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes the \"Bump-In-the-API\" (BIA) host basedprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supportingonly one IP address family
    to communicate with peers that arereachable or supporting only the other address
    family.This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dualstack
    or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack networkcase, single address
    family applications in the host sometime willcommunicate directly with other hosts
    using the different addressfamily. In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only
    destination,IPv4-originated communications have to be translated into IPv6.Technically,
    the BIA-enabled host resolves both A and AAAA addressesof the destination and
    behaves according to received responses.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document
    is an update to and directly derivative from SeungyunLee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin
    Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's[RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual
    stack host means tocommunicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.Theoriginal
    document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.The changes in this document
    reflect four components1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections2. IPv4 address
    pool use private address3. Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently4.
    Adding an alternative way to implement the ENRThe goal of this mechanism is the
    same as that of the Bump-in-the-stack mechanism, but this mechanism provides the
    translation methodbetween the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. Thus, the goal is simplyachieved
    without IP header translation.</p>"
