abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes methods for performing lsp ping over mpls\nrsvp-te
    protection paths, when the protection paths are not in use.\nConventional LSP-Ping
    follows the same path as data traffic.  In some\ncases, it might be useful to
    follow the data path of protection paths\n(detours and bypasses) to ensure that
    the those paths are fully\nfunctional.  This document describes enhancements to
    LSP-Ping to\nperform ping over such paths.\n\t </p>\n      "
