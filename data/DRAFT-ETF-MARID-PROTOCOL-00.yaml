abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the format of a record that domains publish
    to\n   authorize a set of hosts to send mail on its behalf.  This document\n   also
    defines the check_host() function that mail receivers evaluate\n   to see if a
    particular host is authorized to submit a particular\n   piece of mail.  This
    document only describes the particulars of the\n   syntax and the algorithm of
    the function.  See the MARID Core draft\n   (draft-ietf-marid-core) for how these
    are used in the context of\n   sending and receiving Internet mail.\n\t </p>\n
