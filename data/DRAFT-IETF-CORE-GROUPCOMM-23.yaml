abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized
    web\n   transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.\n
    \  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally\n   operate
    in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario all lights\n   in a given room
    may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This\n   specification defines how
    the CoAP protocol should be used in a group\n   communication context.  An approach
    for using CoAP on top of IP\n   multicast is detailed based on both existing CoAP
    functionality as\n   well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also,
    various\n   use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate\n
    \  important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in\n   various
    network topologies.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
