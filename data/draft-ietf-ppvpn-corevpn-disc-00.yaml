abstract:
  content: "<p>An IPVPN consists of many routers, some physically discrete andsome
    virtual, housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem thatpresents itself is
    that these virtual routers need to find eachother over a virtual topology and
    they need to send broadcastdatagrams as mandated in routing protocols [such as
    the neighbordiscovery datagram and routing updates in OSPF, the routingupdates
    in RIPV2 etc] and user data over this virtual topology.This memo presents an approach
    for solving these problems.</p>"
