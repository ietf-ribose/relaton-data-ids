abstract:
- content: <p>DNS highly depends on cache, however, cache usage of non-existence information
    was limited to exact matching. This draft proposes the aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3
    resource record, which is able to express non-existence of range of names authoritatively.
    With this proposal, shorter latency to many of negative response is expected as
    well as some level of mitigation of random sub-domain attacks (referred to as
    "Water Torture" attacks). And more, non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers
    will decrease.</p>
