abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. At present,
    almost all implementations of NETCONF are based on TCP based protocol. QUIC, a
    new UDP-based, secure and multiplexed transport protocol, can facilitate to improve
    the transportation performance, information security and resource utility when
    being used as an infrastructure layer of NETCONF. This document describes how
    to use the QUIC protocol as the transport protocol of NETCONF(It is so called
    NETCONFoQUIC).</p>"
