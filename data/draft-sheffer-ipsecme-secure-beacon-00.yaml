abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Remote access clients, in particular IPsec-based ones, are heavilydeployed
    in enterprise environments. In many enterprises thesecurity policy allows remote-access
    clients to switch to unprotectedoperation when entering the trusted network. This
    document specifiesa method that lets a client detect this situation in a secure
    manner,with the help of a security gateway. We propose a minor extension toIKEv2
    to achieve this goal.</p>"
