abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Content Network Advertisement Protocol (CNAP) is a protocol
    \nIntended to facilitate the interconnection of Content Networks \n(CN). CNAP
    is a simple CN-to-CN information exchange protocol \nthat advertises both content
    and area advertisements. These two \ntypes of advertisements are described in
    [3,6] and are intended \nto be used by content network request routing systems
    [9]. The \nexchange of these advertisements between CNs is intended to \nfacilitate
    inter-CN request-routing decisions.\n\t </p>\n      "
