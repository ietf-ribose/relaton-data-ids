abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model which supports cloud
    SLA\n   applications.  Two apps currently operating from this model are a\n   cloud
    based policer application and a distributed-denial-of-service\n   attack redirect
    application.  Other applications are planned as well.\n\n   Key to this model
    is that it includes semantics for mounting objects\n   from remote network element
    datastores.  These semantics are\n   necessary so that applications can operate
    on objects distributed\n   across multiple devices as if they were part of a single
    local\n   datastore.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
