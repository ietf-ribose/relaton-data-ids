abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes common approaches deployed by enterprises\n
    \  for interconnection of workloads &amp; applications hosted in Cloud DCs\n   with
    on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices. This document also describes\n   some of
    the (network) problems that many enterprises face when they\n   have workloads
    &amp; applications &amp; data split among hybrid data\n   centers, especially
    for those enterprises with multiple sites that\n   are already interconnected
    by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and\n   leased lines.\n\n   Current operational
    problems in the field are examined to determine\n   whether there is a need for
    enhancements to existing protocols or\n   whether a new protocol is necessary
    to solve them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
