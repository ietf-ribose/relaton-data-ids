abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that
    the two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at
    a higher layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at
    the lower layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower
    layers, which has various performance benefits. This document discusses and formalizes
    the concept of channel binding to secure channels. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
