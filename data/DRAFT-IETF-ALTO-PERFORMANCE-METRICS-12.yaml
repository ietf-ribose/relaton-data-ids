abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO), and is used in basic ALTO services including\n   both
    the cost map service and the endpoint cost service.\n\n   Different applications
    may use different cost metrics, but the ALTO\n   base protocol [RFC7285] defines
    only a single cost metric, i.e., the\n   generic \"routingcost\" metric; see Sec.
    14.2 of [RFC7285].  Hence, if\n   the ALTO client of an application wants to issue
    a cost map or an\n   endpoint cost request to determine the resource provider
    that offers\n   better delay performance (i.e., low-delay) to a resource consumer,\n
    \  the base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.\n\n   This document
    addresses the issue by introducing network performance\n   metrics, including
    network delay, jitter, packet loss rate, hop\n   count, and bandwidth.  The ALTO
    server may derive and aggregate such\n   performance metrics from routing protocols
    such as BGP-LS, OSPF-TE\n   and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end traffic management
    tools, and then\n   expose the information to allow applications to determine
    \"where\" to\n   connect based on network performance criteria.\n\n   There are
    multiple sources to derive the performance metrics.  For\n   example, whether
    the metric reported is an estimation based on\n   measurements or it is a service-level
    agreement (SLA) can define the\n   meaning of the performance metric.  Hence,
    an application may need\n   additional contextual information beyond the metric
    value.  This\n   document introduces an additional \"cost-context\" field to the
    ALTO\n   \"cost-type\" field to convey such information.\n\n   \n\t </p>\n      "
