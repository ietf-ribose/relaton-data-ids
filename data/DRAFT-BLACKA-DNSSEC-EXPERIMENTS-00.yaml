abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the long history of the development of the DNS security
    [1]\n   extensions, a number of alternate methodologies and modifications\n   have
    been proposed and rejected for practical, rather than strictly\n   technical,
    reasons.  There is a desire to be able to experiment with\n   these alternate
    methods in the public DNS.  This document describes a\n   methodology for deploying
    alternate, non-backwards-compatible, DNSSEC\n   methodologies in an experimental
    fashion without disrupting the\n   deployment of standard DNSSEC.\n\t </p>\n      "
