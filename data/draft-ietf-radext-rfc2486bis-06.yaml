abstract:
- content: <p>In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized
    method for identifying users. This document defines the syntax for the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during network
    authentication. "Roaming" may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one
    of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, \%customer-vendor
    relationship with only one. Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required
    include ISP "confederations" and \%ISP-provided corporate network access support.
    This document is a revised version of RFC 2486, which originally defined NAIs.
    Enhancements include international character set and privacy support, as well
    as a number of corrections to the original RFC. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
