abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Discovery of Equivalent Encrypted Resolvers (DEER),
    a mechanism for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted
    DNS configuration. This mechanism can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to
    encrypted DNS when only the IP address of an encrypted resolver is known. It can
    also be used to discover support for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of
    an encrypted resolver is known. This mechanism is designed to be limited to cases
    where equivalent encrypted and unencrypted resolvers are operated by the same
    entity.</p>"
