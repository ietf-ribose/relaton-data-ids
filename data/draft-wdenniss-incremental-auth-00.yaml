abstract:
  content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 authorization requests that include every scope the client
    might ever need can result in over-scoped authorization and a sub- optimal end-user
    consent experience. This specification enhances the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol
    by adding incremental authorization, the ability to request specific authorization
    scopes as needed, when they're needed, removing the requirement to request every
    possible scope that might be needed upfront.</p>"
