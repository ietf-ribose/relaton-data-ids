abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In draft-ietf-mpls-sfl-framework the concept of MPLS synonymous
    flow\n   labels (SFL) was introduced.  This document describes a simple\n   control
    protocol that runs over an associated control header to\n   request, withdraw,
    and extend the lifetime of such labels.  It is not\n   the only control protocol
    that moght be used to support SFL, but it\n   has the benefit of being able to
    be used without modifying of the\n   existing MPLS control prodocols.  The existance
    of this design is not\n   intended to restrict the ability to enhance an existing
    MPLS control\n   protocol to add a similar capability.\n\n   A Querier MUST wait
    a configured time (suggested wait of 60 seconds)\n   before re-attempting a Withdraw
    request.  No more than three Withdraw\n   requests SHOULD be made.  These restricctions
    are to prevent\n   overloading the control plane of the actioning router.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
