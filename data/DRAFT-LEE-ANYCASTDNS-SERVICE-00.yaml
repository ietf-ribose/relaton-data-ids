abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo shows an example of how to provide and implement
    IPv4/IPv6\n   dual stack anycast DNS services, which are based on the experience
    of\n   IPv4/IPv6 anycast DNS implementation.  In order to provide a\n   reference
    model to DNS operators who have a plan to deploy IPv4/IPv6\n   anycast DNS services
    onto their own DNS servers in the future, this\n   memo mainly specifies a way
    to configure IPv6-related functions\n   without IPv4-related matters.\n\n\t </p>\n
