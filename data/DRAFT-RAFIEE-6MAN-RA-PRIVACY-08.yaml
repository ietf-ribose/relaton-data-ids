abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of this document is to address the privacy issues
    that\n   exist within the Privacy Extension (RFC 44941) document so that the\n
    \  Privacy Extension document can then be updated to correct these\n   shortcomings.
    These issues include the generation of public addresses\n   based on EUI-64, not
    choosing a good randomized function, not\n   changing the Interface ID (IID) when
    receiving a new router\n   advertisement, and some wording issues that might be
    ambiguous in\n   their interpretation.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
