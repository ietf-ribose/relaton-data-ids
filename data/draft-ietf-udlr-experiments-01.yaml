abstract:
- content: "<p>In March 2001, [RFC 3077] was published and describes a protocol which
    allows to integrate unidirectional links in the Internet. Since then, a number
    of experimentations and deployements using this protocol have been led. This document
    presents various protocols, e.g. layer 2 and layer 3 protocols, which have been
    commonly used over [RFC 3077] in a satellite environment. This document raises
    issues for each of these protocols.</p>"
