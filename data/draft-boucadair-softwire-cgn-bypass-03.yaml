abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two stateful
    DS-Lite AFTR devices when both end-points are located behind different AFTR devices.
    For this purpose a new IPv6 extension header, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension
    Header (TEEH), is defined. The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between
    DS-Lite AFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTR devices.
    A Flow Label based solution is also described.</p>"
