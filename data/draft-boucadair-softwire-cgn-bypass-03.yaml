abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two statefulDS-Lite
    AFTR devices when both end-points are located behinddifferent AFTR devices. For
    this purpose a new IPv6 extensionheader, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header
    (TEEH), is defined.The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between DS-LiteAFTR
    nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTRdevices. A Flow Label
    based solution is also described.</p>"
