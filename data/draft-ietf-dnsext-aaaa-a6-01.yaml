abstract:
  content: "<p>At this moment, there are two DNS resource record types defined forholding
    IPv6 address in the DNS database; AAAA [Thomson, 1995] and A6[Crawford, 2000]
    . AAAA has been used for IPv6 network operation since1996. Questions arose whether
    we really need A6 or not, or whether itis really possible to migrate to A6 or
    not. Some says AAAA is enoughand A6 is not necessary. Some says A6 is necessary
    and AAAA should getdeprecated.</p>"
