abstract:
- content: "<p>At this moment, there are two DNS resource record types defined for
    holding IPv6 address in the DNS database; AAAA [Thomson, 1995] and A6 [Crawford,
    2000] . AAAA has been used for IPv6 network operation since 1996. Questions arose
    whether we really need A6 or not, or whether it is really possible to migrate
    to A6 or not. Some says AAAA is enough and A6 is not necessary. Some says A6 is
    necessary and AAAA should get deprecated.</p>"
