abstract:
  content: "<p>This document defines a provisioning protocol for ENUM-SIP addressingservers.An
    ENUM-SIP addressing server is a host that acts as Lookup Functionin session peering
    to determine the target domain of a given SIPrequest and it may also act as a
    Location Routing Function to developthe location of the SIP signaling entity in
    that target domain.This protocol allows SIP service providers to provision and
    managesession establishment data used by SIP network elements to route SIPsessions
    to the target destinations which may be served by the SIPservice provider's own
    internal network or by a session peeringpartner. The data provisioned into an
    ENUM-SIP addressing server isqueried by SIP entities using ENUM or SIP.This version
    of the protocol integrates comments received on the IETFpeppermint and drinks
    mailing lists before July 2008. This documentis an Internet-Draft and the protocol
    it describes is subject totechnical changes that may make this version incompatible
    with futureversions defined in Internet-Drafts. It is expected that the authorswill
    continue to update this protocol based on the drinks workinggroup requirements
    on the session establishment data.</p>"
