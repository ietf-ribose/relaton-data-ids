abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a generic framework\n
    \  supporting multiple types of authentication methods.  In the most\n   common
    deployment scenario, a peer and server authenticate each other\n   through an
    authenticator; the server sends the master session key\n   (MSK) to the authenticator
    so that the peer and the authenticator can\n   establish a security association
    for per-packet access enforcement.\n   It is desirable to not repeat the entire
    process of authentication\n   when the peer moves to another authenticator.  This
    document\n   specifies extensions to EAP keying hierarchy and an EAP method-\n
    \  independent protocol to facilitate such efficient Re-authentication\n   between
    the peer and the server through an authenticator.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
