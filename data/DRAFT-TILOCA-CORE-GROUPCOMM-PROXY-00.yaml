abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operations performed by a forward-proxy,\n
    \  when using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group\n   communication
    scenarios.  Proxy operations involve the processing of\n   individual responses
    from servers, as reply to a single request sent\n   by the client over unicast
    to the proxy, and then distributed by the\n   proxy over IP multicast to the servers.
    \ When receiving the different\n   responses via the proxy, the client is able
    to distinguish them and\n   their originator servers, by acquiring their addressing
    information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
