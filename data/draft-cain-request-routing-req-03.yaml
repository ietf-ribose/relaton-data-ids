  content: "<p>Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content DistributionNetworks
    (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy ofcontent based on one
    or more metrics. To enable the interconnection ofCDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it is necessary
    for their request-routing systems tointerconnect and exchange information such
    that client requests can berouted between CDNs. This is called request-routing
    internetworking.This document specifies the requirements for request-routinginternetworking.</p>"
