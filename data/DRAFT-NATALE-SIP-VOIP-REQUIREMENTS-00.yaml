abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG
    as a \ncandidate for the chartered work item dealing with \"the minimum set of
    \nrequirements for SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)\", due in March \n2007.
    \ In its present form, this draft is intended solely to provide a \nbasis for
    WG discussion about requirements selection.  As such, it is \nprimarily structural
    and descriptive in nature, leaving prescriptive \ncontent to later revisions driven
    by WG consensus. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
