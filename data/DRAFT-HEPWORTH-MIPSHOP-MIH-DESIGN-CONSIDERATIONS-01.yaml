abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MIPSHOP working group is currently developing functionality
    to\n   support media independent handover services, which are intended to\n   aid
    IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless\n   access systems.
    \ These handover services provide a mechanism by which\n   information such as
    the presence of neighbouring links and networks,\n   and their associated characteristics,
    can be delivered to mobile and\n   other network nodes for the purposes of supporting
    better handover\n   decisions.  A key component of the solution is the set of
    protocols\n   that is used to deliver the various types of information to the\n
    \  appropriate destination node.  A separate problem statement draft\n   outlines
    a structure for this set of protocols as a unified set of\n   common functions,
    supporting a more diverse set of application\n   specific protocols.  This draft
    outlines the key considerations that\n   have to be considered when selecting
    or designing protocols for such\n   common functionality.  This draft is offered
    for use as a mechanism\n   to capture working group discussions on the design
    of the common\n   protocol functions during their initial development, without
    imposing\n   a particular solution on the discussion process.  It is not intended\n
    \  as a long term output.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
