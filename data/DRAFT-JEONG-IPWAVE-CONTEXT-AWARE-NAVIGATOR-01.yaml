abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a Context-Aware Navigator Protocol (CAN)
    for\n   IP-based vehicular networks for cooperative navigation among vehicles\n
    \  in road networks.  This CAN aims at the enhancement of driving safety\n   through
    a light-weight driving information sharing method.  The CAN\n   protocol uses
    an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option to convey\n   driving information such
    as a vehicle's position, speed,\n   acceleration/deceleration, and direction,
    and a driver's driving\n   action (e.g., braking and accelerating).\n\n\t </p>\n
