abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the relationships between the Internet\n
    \  architecture and the ability of people to exercise their right to\n   freedom
    of assembly and association online.  The Internet\n   increasingly mediates our
    lives, our relationships, and our ability\n   to exercise our human rights.  As
    a global forum, the Internet\n   provides a public space, yet it is predominantly
    built on private\n   infrastructure.  Since Internet protocols play a central
    role in the\n   management, development, and use of the Internet, we analyze the\n
    \  relation between protocols and the rights to assemble and associate\n   to
    mitigate infringements on those rights.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
