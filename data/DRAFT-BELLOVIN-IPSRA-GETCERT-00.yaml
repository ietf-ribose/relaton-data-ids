abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>(Insert justification, possibly copied wholesale from section
    1.1 and\nmaybe 2.1/2.2 of draft-kelly-ipsra-userauth-00.txt)\nWe consider inadvisable
    to change IKE [RFC2409] to meet these needs.\nIKE is a complex protocol; adding
    more features to it is a bad idea.\nInstead, we propose a layered approach:  use
    standard IKE, with\ncertificates, but provide a simple mechanism to provide clients
    with\nkeys and certificates.\nA number of objections have been raised to using
    certificates.  The\nmost important is that we lack a public key infrastructure
    (PKI).  We\ndo not agree that this is an obstacle.  Our proposal provides a\nsimple
    mechanism for certificate generation and retrieval, while\nstill relying on legacy
    authentication infrastructures.  Furthermore,\nwe provide for an easy migration
    path to certificate use once\norganizational PKIs are deployed.\nOur purpose at
    this point is not to present a firm protocol.  Rather,\nwe sketch several ideas
    for what such a protocol could look like.\nFinal details can be determined if
    and when the working group opts\nfor this path.\nIn the interests of simplicity,
    we have chosen to reuse standard\nprotocols and components.  In particular, we
    use HTTP [RFC2616] for\ntransport, HTML [RFC1866] as a data representation and
    TLS [RFC2246]\nfor confidentiality.  However, we do not mandate (or even necessarily\nencourage)
    use of a actual Web browser for certificate retrieval.\nAs an alternative, we
    present a transient shared secret generation\nmechanism for IKE.\n\t </p>\n      "
