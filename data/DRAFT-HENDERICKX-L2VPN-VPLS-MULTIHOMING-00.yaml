abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
    \nNetwork (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their \nsites are
    connected via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often \nrequired for the Service
    Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant \nconnectivity to some sites, often
    called \"multi-homing\".  This memo \nshows how multi-homing can be offered in
    the context of LDP-based \nVPLS using BGP-AD.\n\t </p>\n      "
