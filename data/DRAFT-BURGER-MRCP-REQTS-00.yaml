abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol
    to \ncontrol distributed speech processing of audio streams.  By speech \nprocessing,
    this document specifically means automatic speech \nrecognition and text-to-speech.
    \ Other IETF protocols, such as SIP \nand RTSP, address rendezvous and control
    for generalized media \nstreams.  However, speech processing presents additional
    \nrequirements that none of the extant IETF protocols address.\n\t </p>\n      "
