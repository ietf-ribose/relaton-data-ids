abstract:
- content: "<p>The prevalent use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in Next
    Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide adequate control mechanisms
    to maintain transaction throughput by preventing congestion collapse during traffic
    overloads. A loss-based solution to remedy known vulnerabilities of the SIP 503
    (Service Unavailable) overload control mechanism has already been proposed. Using
    the same signaling, this document proposes a rate-based control scheme to complement
    the loss-based control scheme.</p>"
