abstract:
- content: "<p>Pilot Directory Services are growing rapidly. It is useful to know
    how much information is available in the directory. This is important for management
    purposes, both to understand the level of growth, and to provide publicity as
    to what is there. Current counting techniques are both ad hoc and implementation
    specific.</p>"
