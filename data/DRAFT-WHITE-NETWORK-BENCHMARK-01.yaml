abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required
    to\nundertake the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discuss\nsome
    of the possible ways to benchmark a routing protocol performance\nwithin a network,
    and some of the implications of those benchmarks.\nThe definition of convergence
    is discussed first, then polling\nnetwork devices. Several tests which are commonly
    used to measure\nnetwork convergence are examined.\nThis draft does not attempt
    to define what techniques should be used\nto benchmark network convergence, but
    only to provide considerations\nthat testers shoudl consider when attempting to
    measure netowrk\nconvergence using various methods.\n\t </p>\n      "
