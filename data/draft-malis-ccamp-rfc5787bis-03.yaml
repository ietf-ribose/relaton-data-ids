abstract:
  content: "<p>The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operatingan
    Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).The Generalized Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) protocol suiteis designed to provide a control plane for a range
    of networktechnologies including optical networks such as time divisionmultiplexing
    (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and Optical TransportNetworks (OTNs), and lambda
    switching optical networks.The requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements
    ofASON routing, and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocolsare provided
    in other documents. This document defines extensions tothe OSPFv2 Link State Routing
    Protocol to meet the requirements forrouting in an ASON.Note that this work is
    scoped to the requirements and evaluationexpressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and
    the ITU-T Recommendationscurrent when those documents were written. Future extensions
    ofrevisions of this work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendationsare revised
    or if new requirements are introduced into a revision ofRFC 4258.</p>"
