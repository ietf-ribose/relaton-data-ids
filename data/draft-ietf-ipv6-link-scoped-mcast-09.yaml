abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture
    of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows the use of Interface Identifiers (IIDs)
    to allocate multicast addresses. When a link-local unicast address is configured
    at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely determined. After that, each node
    can generate its unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts. The
    alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses proposed in this
    document is better than known methods like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast
    addresses. This memo updates RFC 3306. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
