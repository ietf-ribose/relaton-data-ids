abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate
    power\n   consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n
    \  Autonomous Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and
    then use suitable modifications to the BGP path selection\n   algorithm to route
    the packets along the paths. Such low-power paths\n   can be identified by using
    the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth\n   (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter
    in the BGP Path Selection\n   Algorithm. For re-routing the data traffic through
    these low-power\n   paths, the power based best path is selected and advertised
    as per\n   the modified algorithm proposed in this document. Extensions to the\n
    \  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR\n   ratio
    metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach\n   to reduce the
    power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches is\n   illustrated by applying
    our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.\n   The techniques proposed in this
    paper for the Inter-AS power\n   reduction require minimal modifications to the
    existing features of\n   the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended
    to other levels\n   of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable\n
    \  modifications. A recent addition is the use of this method in AIGP\n   domains
    and also the use of power source data in the calculation of\n   low power paths
    using the BGP path selection algorithm.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
