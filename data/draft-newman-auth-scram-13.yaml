abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used
    byInternet application protocols is the transmission of clear-textpasswords over
    a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).There are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism,which could be addressed by the use of a
    challenge responseauthentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately, thechallenge
    response mechanisms presently on the standards track allfail to meet requirements
    necessary for widespread deployment, andhave had success only in limited use.This
    specification describes a family of Simple Authentication andSecurity Layer (SASL,
    RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called theSalted Challenge Response Authentication
    Mechanism (SCRAM), whichaddresses the security concerns and meets the deployabilityrequirements.
    When used in combination with TLS or an equivalentsecurity layer, a mechanism
    from this family could improve thestatus-quo for application protocol authentication
    and provide asuitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement mechanism for futureapplication
    protocol standards.</p>"
