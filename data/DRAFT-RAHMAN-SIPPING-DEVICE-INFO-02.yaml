abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    event \n   package to carry device information including device status and \n
    \  device profile. Device status refers to a set of dynamic attributes \n   that
    describe device's operating state, availability, and location \n   information
    etc. Device profile on the other hand refers to a \n   limited set of static attributes
    including device type, name, format \n   type of status information, and model
    etc. of a particular device. \n\n   Device status information is particularly
    important to monitoring \n   applications where a user agent would be able to
    monitor the status \n   of a SIP device from a remote location and be notified
    of the \n   changes of status.\n\t </p>\n      "
