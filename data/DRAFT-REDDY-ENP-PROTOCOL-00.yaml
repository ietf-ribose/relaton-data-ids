abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    As the complexity of distributed applications increases, an\n
    \   increasing amount of processing is done using distributed processes,\n    which
    typically execute without the direct supervision of an end\n    user. The user
    must poll these processes periodically to check if\n    they are completed successfully
    or not. This polling results in\n    unnecessary wastage of network bandwidth
    as well as computing\n    resources. The user generally cannot see intermediate
    results or\n    progress reports for long running processes, they must wait till
    the\n    process is completely finished before viewing the results.\n \n    Thus
    the problem of monitoring events is central in distributed\n    applications and
    protocols. A repeated need in such applications is\n    receive notifications
    when a resource property value changes or\n    event state changes. Current database
    systems provides mechanisms\n    like constraints, triggers and active database
    rules. These\n    facilities provides an automated means to ensure the database\n
    \   integrity or perform specific action when data changes. Need for\n    such
    kind of requirement is fundamental is network applications.\n \n    Event Notification
    Protocol(ENP) abstracts the notification\n    requirements from the applications.
    ENP provides a lean and mean\n    protocol with a client side semantics for processing
    notifications.\n    The goal of ENP is to provide a service which allows users
    to select\n    resources or events for which they wish to be notified in case\n
    \   changes of property values or state values occur. The Event\n    Notification
    Protocol will also allow users to define what events or\n    state changes they
    are interested in.\n \n    This document describes the Event Notification Protocol.
    \ The\n    objective is to provide a simple, scalable and highly efficient\n    notification
    protocol while also providing the appropriate\n    flexibility to meet the needs
    of both the internet and enterprise\n    enviro\n\t </p>\n      "
