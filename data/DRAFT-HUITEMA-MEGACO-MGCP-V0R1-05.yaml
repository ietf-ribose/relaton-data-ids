abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an application programming interface and
    a\ncorresponding protocol (MGCP) for controlling Voice over IP (VoIP) Gate-\nways
    from external call control elements. MGCP assumes a call control\narchitecture
    where the call control 'intelligence' is outside the\ngateways and handled by
    external call control elements.\n \nThe document is structured in 6 main sections:\n
    \n*    The introduction presents the basic assumptions and the relation to\n     other
    protocols such as H.323, RTSP, SAP or SIP.\n \n*    The interface section presents
    a conceptual overview of the MGCP,\n     presenting the naming conventions, the
    usage of the session\n     description protocol SDP, and the procedures that compose
    MGCP:\n     Notifications Request, Notification, Create Connection, Modify Con-\n
    \    nection, Delete Connection, AuditEndpoint, AuditConnection and Res-\n     tartInProgress.\n
    \n*    The protocol description section presents the MGCP encodings, which\n     are
    based on simple text formats, and the transmission procedure\n     over UDP.\n
    \n*    The security section presents the security requirement of MGCP, and\n     its
    usage of IP security services (IPSEC).\n \n*    The event packages section provides
    an initial definition of pack-\n     ages and event names.\n \n*    The description
    of the changes made in combining SGCP 1.1 and IPDC\n     to create MGCP 0.1.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
