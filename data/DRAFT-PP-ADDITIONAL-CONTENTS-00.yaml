abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Implementers have recently expressed different views on what
    can\n   appear in the Additional section in DNS responses.  Proposals for\n   adding
    functionality to the DNS protocol that rely on non-glue\n   records in the Additional
    section rely on having a common\n   understanding of the semantics of the Additional
    section.\n\n   This document restates what has been said in other DNS standards,
    and\n   does not update any of them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
