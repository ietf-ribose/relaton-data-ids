abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction(FEC)
    Scheme for the one-dimensional (1-D) interleaved parity codeand its application
    to reliable delivery of media streams in thecontext of FEC Framework. The 1-D
    interleaved parity code is asystematic code, where a number of repair symbols
    are generated froma set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows
    inaddition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s)within a source
    flow. The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a goodprotection against bursty packet
    losses at a cost of decentcomplexity. This document extends the FEC header defined
    in RFC 2733and registers a new RTP payload format for the FEC that is generatedby
    the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulatedin RTP. This new
    payload format is compatible with and used as apart of the DVB Application-layer
    FEC Specification.</p>"
