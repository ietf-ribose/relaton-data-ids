abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NAT provides routing transparency for hosts in disparate routing\n
    \  realms to communicate with each other. However, external agents\n   such as
    Application Level Gateways (ALGs), Host-NAT-clients and\n   Management applications
    need to interact with NAT and influence\n   its operations. The document identifies
    the resources and other\n   elements controlled by a NAT device, with specific
    focus on areas\n   subject to influence from external agents. An Application\n
    \  Programming Interface (API) framework by which external agents\n   could interact
    with NAT is presented. The intent of this document\n   is to leverage the API
    specification as a base to identify\n   requirements for the development of one
    or more protocols by which\n   external agents could interact with NAT.\n\n\t
