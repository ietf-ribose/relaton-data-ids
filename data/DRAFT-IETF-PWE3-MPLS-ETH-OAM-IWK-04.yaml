abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the mapping of defect states between\nEthernet
    Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet\nPseudowires (PWs) connected
    in accordance to the PWE3 architecture\n[RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated
    Ethernet service. This \ndocument augments the mapping of defect states between
    a PW and\nassociated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG-\nMAP].
    In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lack\nof Ethernet OAM
    maturity. However, since then, [Y.1731] and\n[802.1ag] have been completed, and
    this document specifies the\nmapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and
    corresponding\nEthernet PWs.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
