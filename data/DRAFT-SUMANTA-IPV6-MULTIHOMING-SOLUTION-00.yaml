abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Ipv6 Multihoming for Host could be implemented using Ipv6-to-Ipv6\nNetwork
    prefix translation (NPTv6), however NPTv6 not ideal as this\n solution not achieve
    End-to-End transparency of connectivity.\nBasic issues with End host Multihoming
    architecture without\nNPTv6 are:\n 1. Source address selection, 2. Next hop selection\n
    \       and 3. DNS resolution.\n One other approach to solve above mention all
    three issues with\nEnd-to-End transparent connectivity would be using policy at\nEnd
    host to enforce source address and next hop selection.\nIn this document,a solution
    being propose to solve all above\nmention three problem enhancing policy based
    enforcement on host\ndirected by router using its router advertisement.This document\nnot
    obsolete any of the previous work,only propose how policy\non End-host can be
    enforce from router by mapping destination\nprefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.\n\n\n\n\t
