abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtualized resources do not need to be limited to those available
    in\n   traditional data centers, where the infrastructure is stable, static,\n
    \  typically homogeneous and managed by a single admin entity.\n   Computational
    capabilities are becoming more and more ubiquitous,\n   with terminal devices
    getting extremely powerful, as well as other\n   types of devices that are close
    to the end users at the edge (e.g.,\n   vehicular onboard devices for infotainment,
    micro data centers\n   deployed at the edge, etc.).  It is envisioned that these
    devices\n   would be able to offer storage, computing and networking resources
    to\n   nearby network infrastructure, devices and things (the fog paradigm).\n
    \  These resources can be used to host functions, for example to\n   offload/complement
    other resources available at traditional data\n   centers, but also to reduce
    the end-to-end latency or to provide\n   access to specialized information (e.g.,
    context available at the\n   edge) or hardware.\n\n   This document describes
    mechanisms allowing dynamic discovery of\n   virtualization resources and orchestrators
    in IPv6-based networks.\n   In the current version, mechanisms based on piggybacking
    options on\n   IPv6 neighbor discovery are explored.  New IPv6 neighbor discovery\n
    \  options are defined.  Additional mechanisms will be explored in\n   future
    releases of this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
