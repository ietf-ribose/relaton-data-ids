abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Recently, considerable attention has been given to the need to betterstructure
    the information carried in protocols operating within thenetwork access environment.
    The arguable benefits of structuredinformation is consistency in the definitions
    and reuse of individualdata elements and well defined means for extending existingstructures
    to support new or proprietary features and capabilities.In an effort to demonstrate
    the benefits of organizing data elementsand provide a practical means for deploying
    such a model, this memotakes the existing attributes currently used in RADIUS
    and maps theminto a data model. To demonstrate the deployment of the data modelwithin
    the network access environment, the data model has beenrepresented as a PIB. While
    the data model could be implemented torun over protocols other than COPS, SPPI
    is currently the onlylanguage available which expresses data modeling concepts
    withsufficient detail to demonstrate the benefits in a practical manner.</p>"
