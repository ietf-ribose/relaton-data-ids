abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly\n
    \  important functionality that needs to be provided in the Internet.\n   This
    document proposes the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer\n   Protocol (NSLP),
    named Metering NSLP (M-NSLP), which allows the\n   dynamic configuration of Metering
    Entities on the data path.  An\n   accompanying document [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework]
    provides a\n   problem statement, describes scenarios where such a path-coupled\n
    \  configuration of Metering Entities is useful, elaborates requirements\n   for
    a path-coupled protocol for the configuration of Metering\n   Entities and discusses
    the applicability of NSIS for this purpose.\n   This document defines a Metering
    NSLP protocol design and messages,\n   and describes the protocol operation.\n\n\n\t
