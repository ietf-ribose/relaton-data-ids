abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments (such as hotels, coffee shops and other establishments
    that offer Internet service to customers) it is common to start new connections
    in a captive portal mode, i.e. highly restrict what the customer can do until
    the customer has accepted terms of service, provided payment information or authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCP option to inform clients that they are behind some
    sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get
    Internet Access.</p>"
