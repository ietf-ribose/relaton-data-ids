abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document reports studies and related experiments on CDN\n
    \  interconnection performed by France Telecom-Orange Labs.  The\n   document
    summarizes implications of CDN interconnection to CDN\n   service providers and
    lessons learned through CDNI experiments.\n\n   The main purpose of the experiments
    was to test the interconnection\n   of CDN solutions from two vendors (namely,
    Cisco and Verivue) and to\n   identify the gaps and needs for standardization
    work for CDN\n   interconnection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
