abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Virtual switches on server virtualization platforms cause a
    problem\n   in managing networks in data center and between data centers\n   containing
    several hundred switches.  Accordingly, a management\n   information model for
    the networks containing virtual switches is\n   proposed.  The proposed model
    consists of a physical layer (which\n   represents connections between physical
    switches) and a virtual layer\n   (which represents connections between virtual
    switches).  These\n   layers also represent the association of the virtual switch
    with the\n   corresponding physical switch.  This document also provides\n   implementation
    examples of proposed information model in XML and\n   Yang.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
