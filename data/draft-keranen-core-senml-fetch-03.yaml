abstract:
  content: "<p>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type and data model can
    be used to send collections of resources, such as batches of sensor data or configuration
    parameters. The CoAP iPATCH, PATCH, and FETCH methods enable accessing and updating
    parts of a resource or multiple resources with one request. This document defines
    semantics for the CoAP iPATCH, and FETCH methods for resources represented with
    the SenML data model.</p>"
