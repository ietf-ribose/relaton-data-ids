abstract:
  content: "<p>This document describes the general problem of network stratum queryfor
    application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability toquery the network
    from an application controller such as those usedin Data Centers so that application
    controller decisions such asserver assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration
    could beperformed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.As
    application servers are distributed geographically across DataCenters, many application-related
    decisions such as which server toassign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate
    virtual machineswill suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying networkconditions
    are factored in the decision process. The lack of networkawareness may result
    in not meeting the end-user service objectivefor some key applications like video
    gaming/conferencing that requirestringent latency and bandwidth requirement.</p>"
