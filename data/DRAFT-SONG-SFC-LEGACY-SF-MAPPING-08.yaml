abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Service Function Chain (SFC) defines a set of abstract Service\n
    \  Functions (SF) and ordering constraints that must be applied to\n   packets
    and/or frames selected as a result of classification.  One\n   assumption of this
    document is that legacy service functions can\n   participate in service function
    chains without supporting the SFC\n   header, or even being aware of it.  This
    document provides some of\n   the mechanisms between an SFC proxy and an SFC-unaware
    service\n   function (herein termed \"legacy SF\"), to identify the SFC header\n
    \  associated with a packet that is returned from a legacy SF, without\n   an
    SFC header being explicitly carried in the wired protocol between\n   SFC proxy
    and legacy SF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
