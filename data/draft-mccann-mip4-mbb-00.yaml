abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A make-before-break handoff is one where resources on a target systemare
    allocated prior to releasing the resources on a source system.Make-before-break
    can be an effective means to provide a moreseamless handoff with fewer dropped
    packets. The existing MobileIPv4 specification supports simultaneous bindings,
    which canfacilitate a make-before-break handoff. However, the binding stateat
    the home agent is only one example of a resource that can beallocated; others
    include the link connection to the Foreign Agent(or access router) and the provision
    of security associations betweenthe mobile node and the mobility agents. It may
    be desirable to setup these resources on the target system without necessarily
    creatinga binding entry on the Home Agent. This document provides someadditional
    conventions on the use of simultaneous bindings in a make-before-break handoff
    that can be used to optimize the allocation ofresources in these scenarios.</p>"
