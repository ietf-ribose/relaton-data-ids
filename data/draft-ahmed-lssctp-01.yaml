abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC2960 [SXM00] specifications
    utilize the possible multiple paths between the sender and receiver for retransmission
    of lost data chunks and as a backup for the primary path, in case of primary path
    failure. Other than that, all the data chunks are being sent on the primary path
    chosen by the SCTP user during the association initiation. This memo describes
    an extension to SCTP that allows endpoints to use the multiple available paths
    for simultaneous data transmission. The extension maintains SCTP congestion control
    on each path, so as to ensure fair integration with other traffic in the network.</p>"
