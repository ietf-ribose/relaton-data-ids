abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of MANET address autoconfiguration mechanisms introduce significant
    load like message flooding, or are dependent on the underlying routing protocols.
    This document proposes a new mechanism that is intended to minimize these drawbacks.
    It is also designed to be applicable for hybrid MANET, where a MANET is connected
    to Internet through one or more MANET border routers.</p>"
