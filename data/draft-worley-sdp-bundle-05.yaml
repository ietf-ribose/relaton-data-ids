abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number of media descriptions
    ("m= lines") are multiplexed and transmitted over a single transport association.
    The transport association is described by an additional media description, allowing
    SDP attributes to be applied to the aggregate, independently of attributes applied
    to the constituents. In offer/answer usage, the bundle mechanism is backward compatible
    with SDP processors that do not understand the mechanism. The mechanism is designed
    to be compatible with the limitations of the existing Internet infrastructure.</p>
