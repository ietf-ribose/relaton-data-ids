abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The aim of this Internet Draft is to define standard compliant\n
    \  procedures for configuring layer-2 security services in IEEE\n   802.15.4e-based
    Low-power and Lossy Networks. In particular, it\n   provides a review of security
    aspects presented in both IEEE\n   802.15.4-2011 and IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 specifications,
    the\n   classification of secure network configurations and layer-2 keys, the\n
    \  description of a set of consecutive steps required to establish a\n   layer-2
    secure link, and a lightweight Key Management Protocol\n   designed  for negotiating
    a layer-2 one-hop link key. As the final\n   goal, the document would describe
    how security MAC attributes can by\n   initialized and updated in order to offer
    layer-2 security services\n   in real networks.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
