abstract:
  content: "<p>Many IMAP clients display information about total number of messages/total
    number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes. In order to dothat they are forced
    to issue a LIST or LSUB command, to list allavailable mailboxes, followed by a
    STATUS command for each mailboxfound. This document provides an extension to LIST
    command thatallows the client to request STATUS information for mailboxestogether
    with other information typically returned by the LISTcommand.NoteA revised version
    of this draft document will be submitted to the RFCeditor as a Proposed Standard
    for the Internet Community. Discussionand suggestions for improvement are requested,
    and should be sent tomorg@ietf.org.</p>"
