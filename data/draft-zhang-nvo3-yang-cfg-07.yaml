abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the base YANG data model that can be used by
    operators to configure and manage Network Virtualization Overlay protocols. The
    model is focused on the common configuration requirement of various encapsulation
    options, such as VXLAN, NVGRE, GENEVE and VXLAN-GPE. Using this model as a starting
    point, incremental work can be done to satisfy the requirement of a specific encapsulation.</p>"
