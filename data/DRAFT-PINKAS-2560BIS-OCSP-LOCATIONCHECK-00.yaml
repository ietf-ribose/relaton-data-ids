abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 2560 [RFC2560] allows CAs to designate one or more OCSP\n
    \  Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status\n   of the
    certificates they issue under a given CA key.\n\n   This document introduces a
    new feature that allows allows CAs to\n   split the workload between different
    sets of OCSP Responders in a\n   way that is analogous to the way CRLs can be
    split between\n   different sets of CRL issuers (using the cRLDistributionPoints\n
    \  extension).\n\n   This new feature allows a CA to designate one or more OCSP\n
    \  Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status\n   for a
    subset of the certificates they issue under a given CA key.\n\n   This document
    defines a critical extension that may only be placed\n   in an OCSP certificate
    and the way it shall be processed by OCSP\n   clients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
