abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6\nconnectivity
    to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6\nprefix.  DS-Lite requires
    to pre-configure the AFTR tunnel\ninformation on the B4 element.  In many networks,
    the customer\nprofile information may be stored in AAA servers while client\nconfigurations
    are mainly provided through DHC protocol.  This\ndocument specifies two new RADIUS
    attributes to carry Dual-Stack Lite\nAddress Family Transition Router (AFTR) IPv6
    address and name; the\nRADIUS attributes are defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6
    options\nalready specified in draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option.\nThese
    RADIUS attributes are meant to be used between the RADIUS\nServer and the NAS,
    they are not intended to be used directly between\nthe B4 element and the RADIUS
    Server.\n\t </p>\n      "
