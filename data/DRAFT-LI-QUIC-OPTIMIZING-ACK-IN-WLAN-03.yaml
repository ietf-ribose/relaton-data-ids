abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The dependence on frequent acknowledgments (ACKs) is an artifact
    of\n   current transport protocol designs rather than a fundamental\n   requirement.
    \ This document analyzes the problems caused by\n   contentions and collisions
    on wireless medium between data packets\n   and ACKs in WLAN and it proposes an
    ACK mechanism that minimizes the\n   intensity of ACK Frame in QUIC, improving
    the performance of\n   transport layer connection.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
