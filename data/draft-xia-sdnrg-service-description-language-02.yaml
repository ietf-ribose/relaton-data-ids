abstract:
- content: "<p>The more and more complicated IP networks require a new interaction
    mechanism between their customers and their networks. A service description language
    is needed to enable customers to easily describe their diverse intent. SDN controller
    would compile the user intent into device configurations. This document analyzes
    requirements for such service description language and gives considerations for
    designing such service description language.</p>"
