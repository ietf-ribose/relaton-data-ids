abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IETF RFC 2251 [RFC2251] provides a mechanism for indicating, given
    \nany particular entry in the directory tree, what entry in the \ndirectory tree
    holds the directory schema information for that \nparticular entry.  RFC 2251
    does not, however, provide guidance on \nhow different directory servers, each
    of which might have their own \nactive directory schema, should “publicize” this
    directory schema \nsuch that the different active schemas are distinct from one
    another \nwhen viewing the entire directory name-space.  This document \ndescribes
    a way to name sub-schema sub-entry entries such that \ndifferent active schemas
    can be distinguished from one another \nacross the entire directory name-space.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
