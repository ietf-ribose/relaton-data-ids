abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms,
    which are meant to be used for quick re-authentication of a previous session.
    The Hashed Token SASL mechanism's authentication sequence consists of only one
    round-trip. This is achieved by the usage of short-lived, exclusively ephemeral
    hashed tokens. It further provides hash agility, mutual authentication and is
    secured by channel binding.</p>"
