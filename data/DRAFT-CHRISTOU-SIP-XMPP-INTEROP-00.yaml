abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended to serve as a reference point for\n
    \  developers and operators implementing the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP)
    and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)\n   within their networks.
    \ This document does not define any new\n   protocols but does define the different
    reference models for\n   deployment of combined use of SIP and XMPP (\"CUSAX\")
    clients and SIP-\n   XMPP interworking to ensure consistency across the community.\n\n\t
