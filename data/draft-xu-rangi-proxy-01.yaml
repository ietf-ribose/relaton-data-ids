abstract:
- content: "<p>The Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI) described
    in [RANGI] is a proposal for solving routing scalability, mobility, multihoming,
    traffic engineering and other issues facing the current Internet. This document
    describes some transition mechanisms for the RANGI. With these mechanisms, legacy
    IPv4 and IPv6 hosts can communicate with RANGI hosts, and vice versa.</p>"
