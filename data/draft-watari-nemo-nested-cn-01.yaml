abstract:
  content: "<p>This document aims at assisting the problem statement of route optimization
    in nested mobile networks. We describe the paths packets would take using existing
    Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support mechanisms when one or both end nodes of a
    communication flow are located in a nested NEMO. One of both of the end nodes
    may themselves be either mobile nodes performing Mobile IPv6, or standard IPv6
    nodes performing no mobility function at all. The path can become extremely suboptimal
    if no optimization is provided.</p>"
