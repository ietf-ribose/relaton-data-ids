abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Kerberos either retains client identity in all its ticket\n
    \  transformations, or it applies rigorous anonymity.  When crossing\n   over
    to another realm, an intermediate privacy measure is often\n   desired, namely
    pseudonymity, as described in this specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
