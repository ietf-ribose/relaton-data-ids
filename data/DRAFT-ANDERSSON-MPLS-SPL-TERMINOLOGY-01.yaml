abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses and recommends a terminology that may
    be used\n   when MPLS Special Purpose Labels (SPL) are specified and documented.\n\n
    \  Note: The rest of the text in this section is not really part of the\n   abstract
    even though the text is placed here.  It is working notes.\n\n   Note: At least
    at the moment it is not the intention to take this\n   document to an RFC, but
    it might be polled to become a wg document to\n   see if the MPLS working group
    agree on the proposed terminology.\n\n   Note: The changes we propose are minor,
    but we might have to progress\n   the document to RFC since there is a proposed
    change to the \"Special-\n   Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
    Values\" registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
