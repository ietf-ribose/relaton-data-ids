abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise
    to a slew\n   of performance issues.  These performance issues can be addressed
    by\n   some form of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in\n   combination
    with a packet scheduling scheme such as fair queuing.\n   The IETF Active Queue
    Management and Packet Scheduling working group\n   was formed to standardize AQM
    schemes that are robust, easily\n   implementable, and successfully deployable
    in today's networks.  This\n   document describes various criteria for performing
    precautionary\n   characterizations of AQM proposals.  This document also helps
    in\n   ascertaining whether any given AQM proposal should be taken up for\n   standardization
    by the AQM WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
