abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The fundamental problem of Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)\ncomputation
    which is typical of quality of service routing, is that the\nproblem is NP-hard.
    While standard approximation methods exist, their\ncomplexity may often be prohibitive
    in terms of scalability. Recently\npre-computation and caching techniques have
    been suggested [3] [4] to\nachieve better on-demand computation costs. The motivation
    for pre-\ncomputation and path caching is to reduce as much of the on-demand\ncomputational
    overhead as possible.\n\nTo fully utilize Pre-computation and caching of QoS paths
    at a source,\nmechanisms should be available to verify the validity of either
    the\nfull or a partial subset of the pre-computed paths. The mechanisms\nshould
    preferably support verification of the consistency of either\npartial or the full
    pre-computed path cache. In an IP control plane,\nCSPF is expected to work in
    conjunction with OSPF-TE [1] and\nRSVP-TE [2] protocols. To support CSPF algorithms
    that might want to\nuse pre-computation and caching techniques rooted at a source
    or an\nidentified core in the network, we propose mechanisms to dynamically\nsetup
    OSPF 'virtual links' and describe setting up of 'virtual areas'\nto enable OSPF
    based selective network monitoring and updation. Such an\nextension will help
    deploy flexible CSPF algorithms that might be\ndistributed, partially distributed
    or utilize pre-computation or\ncaching techniques.\n\t </p>\n      "
