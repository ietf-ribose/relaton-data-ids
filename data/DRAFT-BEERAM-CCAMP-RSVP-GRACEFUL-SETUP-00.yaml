abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The GMPLS RSVP-TE setup procedure for transport LSPs outlined
    in\n    [RFC3473] involves a single iteration signaling sequence. However\n    there
    are certain scenarios, where it is not feasible to make an LSP\n    fully operational
    and ready for use via the existing single-step\n    setup procedure. This document
    proposes a 2-iteration setup\n    procedure for gracefully bringing up transport
    LSPs in such cases.\n\n \n\t </p>\n      "
