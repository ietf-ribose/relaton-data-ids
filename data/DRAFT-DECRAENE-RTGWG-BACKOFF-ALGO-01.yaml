abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a standard algorithm to back-off link-state
    IGP\n   SPF computations.\n\n   Having one standardized algorithm improves interoperability
    by\n   reducing the probability and/or duration of transient forwarding\n   loops
    during the IGP convergence in the area/level when the network\n   reacts to multiple
    consecutive events.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
