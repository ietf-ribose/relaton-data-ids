abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that
    offer\n   high practical security in cryptographic applications, including\n   Transport
    Layer Security (TLS).  These curves are intended to operate\n   at the ~128-bit
    and ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are\n   generated deterministically
    based on a list of required properties.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
