abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a high-level overview of a possible\n
    \  architecture for building overlay networks in NVO3.  The architecture\n   is
    given at a high-level, showing the major components of an overall\n   system.
    \ An important goal is to divide the space into individual\n   smaller components
    that can be implemented independently and with\n   clear interfaces and interactions
    with other components.  It should\n   be possible to build and implement individual
    components in isolation\n   and have them work with other components with no changes
    to other\n   components.  That way implementers have flexibility in implementing\n
    \  individual components and can optimize and innovate within their\n   respective
    components without requiring changes to other components.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
