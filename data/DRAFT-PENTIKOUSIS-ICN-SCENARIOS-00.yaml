abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking\n
    \  (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about\n   potential
    experimental setups where different approaches can be\n   tested and compared
    against each other.  The scenarios are primarily\n   based on published literature,
    that is, they have all been considered\n   in one or more performance evaluation
    studies, which are already\n   available to the community.  The scenarios selected
    for inclusion in\n   this first draft aim to exercise a variety of aspects that
    an ICN\n   solution can address.  They include a) general aspects, such as,\n
    \  network efficiency, mobility support, multicast and caching\n   performance,
    real-time communication efficacy, disruption and delay\n   tolerance; and b) ICN-specific
    aspects, such as, information security\n   and trust, persistence, availability,
    provenance, and location\n   independence.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
