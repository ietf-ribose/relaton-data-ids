abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo refers to a metric for variation in delay of packets
    across\nInternet paths. The metric is based on the difference in the One-Way-\nDelay
    of selected packets. This difference in delay is called 'IP\nPacket Delay variation.'\nThe
    metric is valid for measurements between two hosts both in the\ncase that they
    have synchronized clocks and in the case that they are\nnot synchronized. We discuss
    both in this draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
