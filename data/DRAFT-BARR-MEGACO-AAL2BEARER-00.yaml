abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes specific procedures that Media Gateways
    (MGs) \nshall follow for AAL2 bearer-path establishment under the control of \nH.248
    (Megaco) capable Media Gateway Controllers (MGCs).  The \nprocedures cover MGs
    which use provisioned VCCs and backward call \nsetup mode dynamic SVCs, and which
    do not use AAL2 signalling (i.e. \nno Q.2630.x). \nAlthough this document refers
    to the use of the H.248 (Megaco) \ngateway control protocol, many of the concepts
    and procedures are \nnot specific to this protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
