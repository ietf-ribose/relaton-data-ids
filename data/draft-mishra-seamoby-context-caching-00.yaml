abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching thecontext
    of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path canreduce the latency
    of handoff's between base stations or access points.Neighbor graphs capture the
    set of all potential mobility paths for awireless network. Given any base station
    or access point, the set of allpossible hand-offs can easily be determined by
    examining the neighborgraph in either a distributed fashion (at each base station)
    orcentralized at the AAA server. This draft describes how the neighborgraph algorithm
    works at both the base station and the AAA server.</p>"
