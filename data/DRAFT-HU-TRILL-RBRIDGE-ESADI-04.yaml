abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without\n   configuration
    in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and\n   link technologies. TRILL
    supports the multi-pathing of both unicast\n   and multicast traffic. Devices
    that implement the TRILL protocol are\n   called RBridges (Routing Bridges) or
    TRILL Switches.\n\n   The ESADI (End System Address Distribution Information)
    protocol is a\n   VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) scoped way that TRILL switches
    can\n   communicate end station addresses to each other.  An RBridge\n   announcing
    VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x appointed\n   forwarder) and running the
    TRILL ESADI protocol can receive remote\n   address information and/or transmit
    local address information for\n   VLAN-x to other such RBridges.  This document
    updates RFC 6325,\n   specifically the documentation of the ESADI protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\t
