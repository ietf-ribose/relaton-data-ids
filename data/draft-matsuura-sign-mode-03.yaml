abstract:
  content: "<p>Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [HC98] has several modeswith
    different number of message passes. For those who want to savetheir bandwidth,
    three-pass Aggressive Mode is a good choice sinceit has minimal number of message
    passes in Phase 1.The public-key primitive method in Aggressive Mode providessignificant
    security advantages over the other alternatives andshould be the method of choice
    in many implementations. In thismethod, however, the responder must pay computational
    cost asexpensive as modular exponentiation BEFORE identifying theinitiator. This
    feature can be abused by malicious initiators for aDenial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
    The purpose of this document is tosolve this problem in digital-signature method
    by using falling-together (FT) mechanism [MI98], [MI99] in conjunction withstateless-connection
    technique [AN97] and an appropriate use ofCookies [KS99].</p>"
