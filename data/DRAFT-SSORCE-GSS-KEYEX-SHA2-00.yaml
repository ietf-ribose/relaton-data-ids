abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies additions and amendments to SSH GSS-API\n
    \  Methods [RFC4462].  It defines a new key exchange method that uses\n   SHA-2
    for integrity and deprecates weak DH groups.  The purpose of\n   this specification
    is to modernize the cryptographic primitives used\n   by GSS Key Exchanges.\n\n\t
