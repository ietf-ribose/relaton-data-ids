abstract:
- content: "<p>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.
    The approach of combining Diffserv and pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides
    a service slightly better than Intserv controlled load that scales to networks
    of any size without needing Diffserv's usual overprovisioning, but only if domains
    trust each other to comply with admission control and rate policing. This memo
    claims to solve this trust problem without losing scalability. It provides a sufficient
    emulation of per-flow policing at borders but with only passive bulk metering
    rather than per-flow processing. Measurements are sufficient to apply penalties
    against cheating neighbour networks.</p>"
