abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes Correlation Id and Heartbeat procedures
    to support lossless fail-over between SCTP [SCTP] associations for SS7 [Q.700]
    Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA] supporting
    the concept of a Routing Context or Interface Identifier. These procedures permit
    lossless fail-over between Application Server Processes (ASPs) at a Signalling
    Gateway (SG) and fail-over between Signalling Gateway Processes (SGPs) and Signalling
    Gateways (SGs) at an Application Server Process (ASP). Lossless fail-over permits
    these fail-overs to occur without loss or duplication of UA-User messages.</p>"
