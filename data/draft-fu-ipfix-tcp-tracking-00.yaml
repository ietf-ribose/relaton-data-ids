abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes several new TCP connection related Information
    Elements (IEs) for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol. The new Information
    Elements can be used to export certain characteristics regarding a TCP connection.
    Through massive gathering of such characteristics, it can help build an image
    of the TCP traffic passing through a network. The image will facilitate the detection
    of anomaly TCP traffic, especially attacks targeting at TCP.</p>"
