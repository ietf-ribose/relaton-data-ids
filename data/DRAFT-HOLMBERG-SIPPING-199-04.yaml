abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early
    Dialog\nTerminated, which a SIP entity can use to indicate upstream that an\nearly
    dialog has been terminated.  The response code can be used by a\nSIP entity, normally
    a forking SIP proxy, to allow the UAC to know\nthat an early dialog has been terminated
    before it a final response\nis sent to the request.\n\t </p>\n      "
