abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting the quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo is one of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN-domain. The behaviour described here
    is that for a form of measurement-based load control using two PCN marking states,
    not- marked, and excess-traffic-marked. This behaviour is known informally as
    the Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node behaviour.</p>"
