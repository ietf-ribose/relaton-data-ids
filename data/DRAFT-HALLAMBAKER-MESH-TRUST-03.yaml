abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This paper extends Shannon's concept of a 'work factor' as
    applied to\n   evaluation of cryptographic algorithms to provide an objective\n
    \  measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or\n   infrastructure
    design.  Considering the hypothetical work factor\n   based on an informed estimate
    of the probable capabilities of an\n   attacker with unknown resources provides
    a better indication of the\n   relative strength of protocol designs than the
    computational work\n   factor of the best-known attack.\n\n   The social work
    factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a\n   credential issued in a PKI
    based on the cost of having obtained the\n   credential through fraud at a certain
    point in time.  Use of the\n   social work factor allows evaluation of Certificate
    Authority based\n   trust models and peer to peer (Web of Trust) models to be
    evaluated\n   in the same framework.  The analysis demonstrates that both\n   approaches
    have limitations and that in certain applications, a\n   blended model is superior
    to either by itself.\n\n   The final section of the paper describes a proposal
    to realize this\n   blended model using the Mathematical Mesh.\n\n   [Note to
    Readers]\n\n   Discussion of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list\n
    \  (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.\n\n
