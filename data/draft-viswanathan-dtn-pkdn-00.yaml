abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
    in which communications can be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.
    DTN specifies the use of public-key cryptography to secure the confidentiality
    and integrity of messages in transit. The use of public-key cryptography posits
    the need for certification of public keys and revocation of certificates. This
    document formally defines the DTN key management problem and then provides a high-level
    design solution for delay and disruption tolerant distribution and revocation
    of public-key certificates along with relevant design options and recommendations
    for design choices.</p>"
