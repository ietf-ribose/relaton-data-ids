abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information. This document discusses how the neighbor discovery state
    machine on a first-hop router is causing user-visible connectivity issues when
    a new (not being seen on the network before) IPv6 address is being used. The various
    approaches to mitigate the problem are described, with the proposed solution fully
    documented in I-D.ietf-6man-grand.</p>"
