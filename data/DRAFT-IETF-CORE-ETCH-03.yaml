abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The methods defined in RFC 7252 for the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) only allow access to a complete resource, not to\n   parts
    of a resource.  In case of resources with larger or complex\n   data, or in situations
    where a resource continuity is required,\n   replacing or requesting the whole
    resource is undesirable.  Several\n   applications using CoAP will need to perform
    partial resource\n   accesses.\n\n   This specification defines the new CoAP methods,
    FETCH, PATCH and\n   iPATCH, which are used to access and update parts of a resource.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
