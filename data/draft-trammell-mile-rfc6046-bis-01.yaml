abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common
    XML format for document exchange, and Realtime Internetwork Defense (RID) defines
    extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security incidents
    within consortia of network operators and enterprises. This document specifies
    a transport protocol for RID based upon the passing of RID messages over HTTP/TLS.
    This document updates the previous [RFC6046] to change the intended status to
    Proposed Standard, and to reference the updated RID specification.</p>"
