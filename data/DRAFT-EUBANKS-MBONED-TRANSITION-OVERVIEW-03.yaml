abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPTV providers must serve content to their customers during
    the\n   period of transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  During this period, the\n   content
    provider may support only one version of IP while the\n   customer supports only
    the other.  Likewise, the network between the\n   provider and its customer may
    include segments supporting only one\n   version of IP or another.\n\n   This
    document provides an overview of the multicast transition\n   problem.  It also
    provides an overview of the solution space.  The\n   solution space is characterized
    by an adaptation function (AF) that\n   provides an interface between IPv4 and
    IPv6 multicast domains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
