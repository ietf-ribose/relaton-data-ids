abstract:
- content: <p>As stated in the MEXT charter, the working group will "work on operational
    considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so that traffic is distributed
    in an optimal way". This topic, referred to as Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM), has motivated the submission of multiple problem statement and solution
    drafts. This document aims at summarizing the current status of the DMM effort,
    mainly focusing on Mobile IPv6-based solutions, in order to initiate more discussions
    within the working group.</p>
