abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a network system with Physical
    Network\n   and Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time.\n
    \  The construction of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of\n   Physical
    Network to update the state of Twin Network.  However the\n   existing method
    collects the full amount of data from the Physical\n   Network for modeling, and
    does not consider the problems such as\n   insufficient storage resources, low
    computational efficiency and\n   waste of bandwidth resources.  This document
    introduces an efficient\n   data collection method in which the Twin Network sends
    instructions\n   to the Physical Network to collect data on demand, and then the\n
    \  Physical Network parses and executes instructions such as data\n   cleaning
    and knowledge representation, and sends the processed or\n   requested data to
    the Digital Twin Network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
