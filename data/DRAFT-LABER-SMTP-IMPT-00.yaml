abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes the protocol called Inter Mail Provider
    Trust\n   (IMPT) which ensures that a cryptographically secured communication\n
    \  channel is always established with Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   when
    delivering messages via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\n   between Mail
    Transfer Agents (MTAs) of pre-registered participants.\n   Mainly the participants
    exchange SMTP routing information about their\n   MTA infrastructure for this
    purpose.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
