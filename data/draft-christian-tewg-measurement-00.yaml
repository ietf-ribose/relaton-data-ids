abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes measurement in order to accomplish Traffic Engineering
    (TE) in IP networks. This document will aid vendors in their choice of information
    to provide; it will assist network operators in determining the appropriate information
    to request; and will demonstrate how measurements are used to accomplish TE. The
    objective of this memo is to describe TE measurement. This memo will also describe
    (in brief) some methods for using the variables and some methods for gathering
    the information.</p>"
