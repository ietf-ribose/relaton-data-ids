abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The continuous growth of routing tables in the core of Internet
    is achallenge. It would become overwhelming if each multihomed customersite would
    need a provider independent prefix to take full advantageof its multihoming. IPv6
    has the potential to solve this problem,but a complete specification is still
    missing. This draft proposesan approach for a solution.The Stateless Address Mapping
    (SAM) model, introduced for this, isapplicable to a hierarchy of routing zones
    with multihoming permittedat each level, and with each zone using local addresses
    for itsinternal routing plan. End-to-end transparency of the Internet ismaintains
    across these local-address zones, thanks to a systematicencapsulation of global-address
    packets into local-address packets.Local addresses are statelessly derived from
    prefixes found in globaladdresses, and from static parameters of traversed zones.
    Globalprefixes delegated by a zone to its child interfaces can be obtainedby autoconfiguration,
    thanks to to a bidirectional correspondencebetween SAM local addresses and SAM
    global prefixes.Deployment can be incremental.</p>"
