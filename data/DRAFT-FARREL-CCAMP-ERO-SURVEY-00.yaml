abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During discussions of a document to provide guidance on the
    use of\n   addressing fields within the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic\n
    \  Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol used in Generalized\n   Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS), it was determined that there\n   was considerable variation
    in the implementation of options for the\n   Explicit Route Object (ERO).\n\n
    \  Since there was a proposal to deprecate some of the options, it was\n   felt
    necessary to conduct a survey of the existing and planned\n   implementations.\n\n
    \  This document summarizes the survey questions and captures the\n   results.
    Some conclusions are also presented.\n\n   This survey was informal and conducted
    via email. Responses were\n   collected and anonymized by the CCAMP working group
    chair.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
