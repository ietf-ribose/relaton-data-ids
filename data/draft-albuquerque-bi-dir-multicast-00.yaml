abstract:
  content: "<p>This document addresses the problem of providing a bi-directionalmulticast
    protocol in an Intranet environment. A protocol namedSwitched Bi-directional Multicast
    Protocol (XMP) is proposed.Participants(Sender, S, or Receivers, Rs)signal their
    will to jointhe group sending a START(G) packet toward a Focal Point Router(FP).To
    take control of transmission a receiver application receivespermission from the
    master application (the master transmitter)andsends a START(G) packet re-labeling
    the involved routers interfacesfrom R to S. The master Sender resumes transmission
    by means of hisapplication commanding the receiver's application to go back to
    thereceiver mode and emitting a START(G)packet to FP. ns-2 has been usedto simulate
    it.</p>"
