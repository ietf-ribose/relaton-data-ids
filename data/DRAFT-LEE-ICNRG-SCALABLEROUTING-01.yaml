abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a scalable Route-By-Name Routing scheme
    for ICN.\n   [ICN Challenges] describes three possible routing schemes: Route-By-\n
    \  Name Routing (RBNR), Lookup-By-Name Routing (LBNR), and Hybrid\n   Routing
    (HR). Among them, RBNR has advantages in terms of performance\n   and evolvability
    but scalability is a challenging issue. This memo\n   proposes a RBNR scheme using
    hierarchically-organized name space for\n   the scalability.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
