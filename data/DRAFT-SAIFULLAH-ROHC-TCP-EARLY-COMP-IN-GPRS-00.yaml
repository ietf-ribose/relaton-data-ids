abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This information document gives an example of early compression\nmechanism
    from the GPRS networks.  It shows a utilization of the\nearly compression enabler
    enhancements proposed for ROHC-TCP.  It\ndoes not show an exhaustive use of all
    the options of the enabler,\nbut rather shows a use of the basic enabler function.\n\t
