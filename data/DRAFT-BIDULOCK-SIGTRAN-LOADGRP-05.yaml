abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    This Internet-Draft describes an extension parameter and procedure\n
    \ to the Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [IUA], [M2UA], [M3UA],\n  [SUA],
    [DUA], [V5UA], [GR303UA], [ISUA], [TUA], based on the Stream\n  Transmission Control
    Protocol (SCTP) [SCTP] which permits an\n  Application Server Processes (ASP)
    to indicate its placement within a\n  Load Group and permits an Signalling Gateway
    (SG) to distribute\n  traffic over Load Groups under Application Server Process
    (ASP)\n  control.\n\n    The described procedure provides for Override, Load-share
    and\n  Broadcast traffic mode operation within a Load Group consisting of one\n
    \ or more Application Server Processes (ASPs) resulting in a mixture of\n  traffic
    modes within an Application Server (AS).  The parameters and\n  procedures described
    here supplement the UA Load Selection [LOADSEL]\n  extension parameters and procedures
    for improved distribution of\n  traffic over ASPs and Signalling Gateway Processes
    (SGPs).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
