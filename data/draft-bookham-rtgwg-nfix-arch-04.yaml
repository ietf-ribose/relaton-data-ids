abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergence of technologies such as 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    and Industry 4.0, coupled with the move towards network function virtualization,
    means that the service requirements demanded from networks are changing. This
    document describes an architecture for a Network Function Interconnect (NFIX)
    that allows for interworking of physical and virtual network functions in a unified
    and scalable manner across wide-area network and data center domains while maintaining
    the ability to deliver against SLAs.</p>"
