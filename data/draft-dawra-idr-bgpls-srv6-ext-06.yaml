abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) allows for a flexible definition of end-
    to-end paths within various topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological
    or functional sub-paths, called "segments". These segments are advertised by the
    various protocols such as BGP, ISIS and OSPFv3. BGP Link-state (BGP-LS) address-family
    solution for SRv6 is similar to BGP-LS for SR for MPLS dataplane. This draft defines
    extensions to the BGP-LS to advertise SRv6 Segments along with their functions
    and other attributes via BGP.</p>
