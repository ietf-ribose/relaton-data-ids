abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a proposed public interface through
    which an\n   application, such as a network management console, interacts with
    an\n   Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) Manager via a database\n   supporting
    the Structured Query Language (SQL).  The use of SQL as an\n   interfacing layer
    provides a natural way to describe interactions\n   with an AMP Manager independent
    of a particular implementation of\n   either the Manager or the application.  Specifically,
    this document\n   presents a database schema capturing how to send controls to
    a\n   Manager and how to accept reports received by a Manager from one or\n   more
    AMP Agents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
