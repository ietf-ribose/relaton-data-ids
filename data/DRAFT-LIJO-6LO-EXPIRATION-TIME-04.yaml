abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a new type for the 6LoWPAN routing
    header\n   containing the delivery deadline time for data packets.  The deadline\n
    \  time enables forwarding and scheduling decisions for time critical\n   IoT
    M2M applications that need deterministic delay guarantees over\n   constrained
    networks and operate within time-synchronized networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
