abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts
    or\n   multicast messages for functions such as local service discovery or\n   name
    resolution.  Some of these functions can only be implemented\n   efficiently using
    such mechanisms.  When using broadcasts or\n   multicast messages, a passive observer
    in the same broadcast domain\n   can trivially record these messages and analyze
    their content.\n   Therefore, broadcast/multicast protocol designers need to take\n
    \  special care when designing their protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
