abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism to
    \nprovide accessibility for IPv6 node to IPv4 node, and vice-versa.\nThe goal
    of this document is not providing the most fundamental \ntechnology which could
    works well with additional technology.\nWe used to have an technology called NAT-PT[RFC2766].
    NAT-PT was \ndesigned to work with problematic DNS Application Level Gateway.
    So,\nit was changed to historical state by [RFC4966].\nThis document attempts
    to simplify NAT-PT specification, removing \ndependability on Application Layer
    Gateway as well as resolving\nproblems pointed in [RFC4966].\n\t </p>\n      "
