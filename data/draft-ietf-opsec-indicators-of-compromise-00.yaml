abstract:
- content: "<p>Cyber defenders frequently rely on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
    to identify, trace, and block malicious activity in networks or on endpoints.
    This draft reviews the fundamentals, opportunities, operational limitations, and
    best practices of IoC use. It highlights the need for IoCs to be detectable in
    implementations of Internet protocols, tools, and technologies - both for the
    IoCs' initial discovery and their use in detection - and provides a foundation
    for new approaches to operational challenges in network security.</p>"
