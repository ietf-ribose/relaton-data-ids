abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not used operationally, complicates\n
    \  implementations, and complicates protocol specifications.  The form\n   of
    anycast actually used in the Internet is routing-based, and is\n   essentilly
    the same as that of IPv4 anycast.  Therefore, this\n   document deprecates IPv6
    Subnet Anycast.\n\n   This is an early draft and will require non-trivial fill-in
    and\n   details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
