abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces analyzes of ECN(Explicit Congestion\n
    \  Notification)in case of congestion of local links. 3GPP adopts and\n   specifies
    shared channel for multiple user equipments in a cell.\n   Other last mile access
    systems (e.g. xDSL access and Frame Relay\n   access) have to handle congestion
    since bandwidth multiplexing is\n   most likely considered for reducing unnecessary
    cost.  Therefore,\n   congestion in access network is to inform user equipments
    in case of\n   traffic congestion utilizing congestion notification concepts and\n
    \  similar mechanisms.\n\n   Besides the argument on the congestions of access
    networks, this\n   document is also to introduce the use case of Conex which might
    be\n   useful for the potential Conex proposals to notify and address the\n   congestion
    of wireless access network further.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
