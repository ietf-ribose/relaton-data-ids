abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The QUIC transport protocol preserves its future extensibility
    partly\n   by specifying its version number.  There will be a relatively small\n
    \  number of published version numbers for the foreseeable future.  This\n   document
    provides a method for clients and servers to negotiate the\n   use of other version
    numbers in subsequent connections and encrypts\n   Initial Packets using secret
    keys instead of standard ones.  If a\n   sizeable subset of QUIC connections use
    this mechanism, this should\n   prevent middlebox ossification around the current
    set of published\n   version numbers and the contents of QUIC Initial packets,
    as well as\n   improving the protocol's privacy properties.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
