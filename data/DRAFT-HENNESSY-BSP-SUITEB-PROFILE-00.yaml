abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The United States Government has published guidelines for \"NSA
    Suite\n   B Cryptography\" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm
    policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies the conventions
    for using Suite B cryptography in the\n   Bundle Security Protocol (BSP)\n\n   Since
    many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments\n   as well, the
    majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B\n   algorithms are already
    specified in other documents.  This document\n   references the source of these
    conventions, with some relevant\n   details repeated to aid developers that choose
    to support Suite B.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
