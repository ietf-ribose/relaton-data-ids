abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)
    service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces.
    AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding. Prefix delegation/registration
    services are employed for network admission and to manage the routing system.
    Secure multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, traffic selector signaling
    and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache
    updates. AERO is a widely- applicable mobile internetworking service especially
    well-suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile end
    user devices and many other applications.</p>"
