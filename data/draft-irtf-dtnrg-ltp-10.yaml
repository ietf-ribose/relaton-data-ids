abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), designed
    to provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely
    long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity.
    Since communication across interplanetary space is the most prominent example
    of this sort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting "long-haul"
    reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has applications in other
    environments as well. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication
    as an RFC were raised. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>
