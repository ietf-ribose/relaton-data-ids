abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The application of summoning emergency assistance by using
    a phone to\n   call 9-1-1 in North America has been ingrained in society for 40+\n
    \  years.  A successful emergency response to a caller in need, is\n   dependent
    upon the responders receiving accurate location information\n   to effect timely
    action.  Traditional wireline telephony is able to\n   utilize the location of
    the physical wires as a source of information\n   for caller location, whereas
    wireless technologies require more\n   exotic mechanisms to locate a 9-1-1 caller.\n\n
    \  Mechanisms for locating a cellular caller dialing 9-1-1 is based on\n   20
    year old technology, which was designed for outdoor environments,\n   and does
    not perform sufficiently when used to locate an emergency\n   caller from within
    a home or office building environment.\n\n   With growing trends in mobile cellular
    usage, large portions of\n   subscribers are relying solely on their mobile phones
    to make\n   emergency calls.  Emergency response time suffers when that caller
    is\n   located indoors.\n\n   This document defines the problem statement and
    solutions for\n   expanding the current set of methods used to locate a cellular
    caller\n   to 9-1-1.  The expansion of the methods includes connections to\n   services
    that are outside the normal administrative domain of the\n   cellular provider,
    hence both the privacy and security aspects of\n   connecting these systems are
    taken into consideration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
