abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a topology-transparent zone in an IS-IS area.
    A zone is a subset (block/piece) of an area, which comprises a group of routers
    and a number of circuits connecting them. It is abstracted as a virtual entity
    such as a single virtual node or zone edges mesh. Any router outside of the zone
    is not aware of the zone. The information about the circuits and routers inside
    the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.</p>"
