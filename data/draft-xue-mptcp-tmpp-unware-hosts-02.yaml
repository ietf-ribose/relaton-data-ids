abstract:
- content: "<p>Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based function,
    which is under MPTCP architecture. It can help two MPTCP- unaware hosts enjoy
    multipath support, and can be extensively used both in the access networks and
    operators' networks. Meanwhile, in MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP needs to
    modify the received packets and transmit them again(just like gateway in NAT environment).
    In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for data transfer on TMPP's side.
    The consideration of data transfer can be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with
    proxy.</p>"
