abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering
    to deploy\n   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a\n
    \  consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting\n   these
    local CDNs.  The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs\n   are currently
    being defined in the Content Delivery Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) WG.
    \ This document focusses on the Request\n   Routing Interface of CDNI, and more
    specifically on how the solutions\n   currently being defined in the Application
    Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO) WG can improve CDNI request routing.  The
    overall intention\n   behind this document is to foster discussions (in the CDNI
    as well as\n   in the ALTO WG) regarding if, how, and under what conditions ALTO
    can\n   be useful to optimize CDNI request routing.  As basis for this\n   discussion,
    this document provides concrete examples of how ALTO can\n   be integrated within
    CDNI request routing and in particular in the\n   process of selecting a downstream
    CDN.  The examples in this document\n   are based on the use cases and examples
    currently being discussed in\n   the CDNI WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
