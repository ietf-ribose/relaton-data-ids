abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Currency Protocol (LCP) is a framework for creating
    lightweight currencies to be used by applications that rely on market forces for
    the allocation of scarce resources, or rely on incentives for the creation and
    operation of desirable services that would be otherwise impractical or infeasible
    through the use of real-world currencies.</p>"
