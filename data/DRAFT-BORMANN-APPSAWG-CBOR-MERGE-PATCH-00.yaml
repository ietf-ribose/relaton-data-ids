abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines the CBOR merge patch format and
    processing\n   rules, as an analog to the JSON merge patch format defined in RFC\n
    \  7396.  The merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the\n   HTTP
    PATCH method and potential related CoAP methods as a means of\n   describing a
    set of modifications to a target resource's content.\n\n   This specification
    also defines how a JSON merge patch document is\n   applied to a CBOR data item
    and vice versa.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
