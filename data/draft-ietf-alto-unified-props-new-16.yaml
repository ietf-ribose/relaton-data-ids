abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) Protocol by generalizing the concept of "endpoint properties" as applied
    to endpoints as defined by IP addresses to endpoints defined by a wider set of
    objects. Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the network
    and cost maps in the base ALTO protocol. The protocol is extended in two major
    directions. First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering
    a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties on specific endpoints
    to entire entity property maps. These extensions introduce additional features
    allowing entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.
    This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property
    types.</p>
