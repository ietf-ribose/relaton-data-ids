abstract:
- content: <p>DNS Long-Lived Queries (LLQ) is a protocol for extending the DNS protocol
    to support change notification, thus allowing clients to learn about changes to
    DNS data without polling the server. From 2007 onwards, LLQ was implemented in
    Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base
    stations. In 2019, the LLQ protocol was superseded by the IETF Standards Track
    RFC "DNS Push Notifications", which builds on experience gained with the LLQ protocol
    to create a superior replacement. The existing deployed LLQ protocol is documented
    here to give background regarding the operational experience that informed the
    development of DNS Push Notifications, and to help facilitate a smooth transition
    from LLQ to DNS Push Notifications.</p>
