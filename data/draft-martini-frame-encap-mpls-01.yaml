abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines frame relay pseudo-wire emulation edge-to-edge.A
    frame relay pseudo-wire is a mechanism that exists between aprovider's edge network
    nodes and support as faithfully as possibleframe relay services over IP and MPLS
    packet switched network (PSN).Two mapping modes are defined: One-to-one mapping
    mode characterizedby a one to one relationship between a frame relay VC and a
    pairof MPLS LSPs is defined for MPLS PSN. The other mode is known as portmode
    or many-to-one mapping mode and is defined for MPLS PSN and IPPSN with L2TPv3.</p>"
