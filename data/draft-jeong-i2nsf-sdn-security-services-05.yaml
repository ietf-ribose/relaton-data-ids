abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework, objectives, requirements, and
    use cases for security services based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using
    a common Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF). It first proposes the
    framework of SDN-based security services in the I2NSF framework. It then explains
    three use cases, such as a centralized firewall system, centralized DDoS-attack
    mitigation system, and centralized VoIP/VoLTE security system.</p>"
