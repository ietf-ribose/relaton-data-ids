abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a methodology for testing the\noperation,
    administration and maintenance (OA&amp;M) of a general\nVPN service, that is applied
    here to Hierarchical Virtual\nPrivate LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS].
    \ As part\nof this methodology, the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-\nPING]
    are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke connectivity\ntesting.  A method to
    provide the information necessary for\nthis spoke-to-spoke OA&amp;M is also proposed.\nThese
    are the goals of this draft:\n-   checking connectivity between 'service-aware'\nnodes
    of a network,\n-   verifying data plane and control plane integrity,\n-   verifying
    service membership\nThere are two specific requirements to which we call attention\nbecause
    of their seemingly contradictory nature:\n-   the checking of connectivity MUST
    involve the\nability to use packets that look like customer\npackets\n-   the
    OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond the\nboundary of the provider network\n\t
    </p>\n      "
