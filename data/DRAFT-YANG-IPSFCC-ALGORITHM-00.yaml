abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In this document, an algorithm for intrusion prevention systems
    based\n   on fuzzy connectedness clustering was presented in order to measure\n
    \  the similarity. Fuzzy connectedness that was first applied in image\n   segmentation
    was extended to clustering algorithm, and used as the\n   similarity metric between
    objects to be clustered. By a little expert\n   knowledge, starting with at least
    one seed data in each cluster, the\n   similarity between each data in dataset
    and each seed data in each\n   cluster was measured. According to the highest
    fuzzy connectedness\n   of each data, clustering was finished. This algorithm
    was applied in\n   intrusion prevention systems as a tool of detecting intrusion,\n
    \  overcoming some shortcomings of previous clustering algorithm.\n\t </p>\n      "
