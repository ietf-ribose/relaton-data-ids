abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NETCONF remote network configuration protocol currently
    lacks an\n   access control model.  The need for such a model has been recognised\n
    \  within the NETCONF working group.  The eXtended Access Control Markup\n   Language
    (XACML) is an XML-based access control standard, with\n   widespread acceptance
    from the industry and good open-source support.\n   This document proposes a profile
    that defines how to use XACML to\n   provide fine-grain access control for NETCONF
    commands.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
