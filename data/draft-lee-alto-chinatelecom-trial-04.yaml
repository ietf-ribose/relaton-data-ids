abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the experience of China Telecom in a recent experiment
    with the ALTO service and P2P caches deployment. It is found that the deployment
    of the ALTO service significantly improves the capability of a Service Provider
    to affect the distribution of P2P traffic. It is also found that a traffic localized
    ALTO policy may decrease the download speed of a P2P user. However, the deployment
    of some P2P caches can compensate such influence.</p>"
