abstract:
- content: "<p>Decision-making is difficult when there is a need to consider the interests
    of all of the affected parties and when it is important to gain widespread community
    consensus. This document discusses about consensus. It neither seeks to define
    consensus nor does it prescribe practices for the Internet Standards Process.</p>"
