abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked\n
    \  flexibility, and required long planning times when deploying new\n   services.
    Network Providers and Service Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow
    separation of data plane and control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path
    setup and protection, and centralized\n   path computation for service planning
    and traffic engineering.\n   Although these technologies provide significant benefits,
    they do\n   not meet the growing need for network programmability, automation,\n
    \  resource sharing, and service elasticity necessary for meeting\n   operator's
    requirement for their virtual network operation.\n\n   Virtual network operation
    refers to the creation of a\n   virtualized environment allowing operators to
    view the\n   abstraction of the underlying multi-admin, multi-vendor, multi-\n
    \  technology networks and to operate, control and manage these\n   multiple networks
    as single virtualized network. Another\n   dimension of virtual network operation
    is associated with use of\n   the common core transport network resource by multi-tenant\n
    \  service networks as a way of providing a virtualized\n   infrastructure to
    flexibly offer new services and applications.\n\n   The work effort investigating
    this problem space is known as\n   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks
    (ACTN). This\n   document provides an ACTN problem description, scope of work,\n
    \  and outlines the core requirements to facilitate virtual network\n   operation.\n\n\t
