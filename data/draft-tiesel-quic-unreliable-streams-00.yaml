abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines support for unreliable streams in QUIC. This draft
    contains a collection of considerations and requirements for unreliable streams
    in QUIC based on [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-transport]. It provides to alternatives
    demonstrating how unreliable streams can be realized. The intention of this document
    is to collect considerations regarding unreliable streams in QUIC and to frame
    the design space. All content of this memo is supposed to be merged into [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-transport],
    [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-recovery] and, [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-applicability] once unreliable
    streams get integrated with QUIC.</p>"
