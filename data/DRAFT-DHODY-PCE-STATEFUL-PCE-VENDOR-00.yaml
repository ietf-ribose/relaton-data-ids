abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information
    on\n   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path\n   (LSPs),
    reserved resources within the network, and pending path\n   computation requests.
    \ This information may then be considered when\n   computing new traffic engineered
    LSPs, and for associated and\n   dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs).\n\n   RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information
    in\n   PCEP.\n\n   This document extends this capability for stateful PCE.\n\n\t
