abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
    chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the end hosts,
    i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address of another node in
    the same IP link. However, since SAVI requires the edge routers or switches to
    be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI will need a long time. During this transition
    period, some techniques for source address validation beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF)
    may be needed to complement SAVI. In the document, we analyze the problems of
    the current SAVI-BF technique, and discuss the directions we can explore to improve
    SAVI-BF.</p>"
