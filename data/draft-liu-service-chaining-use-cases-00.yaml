abstract:
- content: "<p>For some network services, traffic is forwarded through a sequence
    of network functions, which usually have dedicated capabilities other than forwarding,
    e.g. firewall. Forwarding of traffic along a sequence of service processing functions
    is usually based on service characteristics, but not destination addresses. We
    call such way of forwarding as service chaining. This memo describes use cases
    of service chaining.</p>"
