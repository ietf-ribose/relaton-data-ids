abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an\n   Organizationally
    Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE\n   Standards Association and an
    Extension Identifier assigned to the\n   hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1
    RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This\n   means that a node will always have the same Interface
    ID (IID)\n   whenever it connects to a new network. Since the node's IP address\n
    \  does not change, the node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks.\n   To
    address this problem there are currently two mechanisms being used\n   to randomize
    the IID that do not use the MAC address or other unique\n   values in the IID
    generation; Cryptographically Generated Addresses\n   (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy
    Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the\n   former approach is the computational
    cost involved for the IID\n   generation and verification. The problem with the
    latter approach is\n   that it lacks the necessary security and provides the node
    with only\n   partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document\n
    \  proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the\n   IID
    while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of\n   attack, like
    IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented with the\n   addition of a signature
    to the messages sent over the network and by\n   direct use of a public key in
    the IP address.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
