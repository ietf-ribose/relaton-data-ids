abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique
    in attack\n   defence (often called cyber defence).  This document outlines the\n
    \  different types of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations,\n   and
    discusses their effective use.  It also contextualises the role\n   of IoCs in
    defending against attacks through describing a recent case\n   study.  This draft
    does not pre-suppose where IoCs can be found or\n   should be detected - as they
    can be discovered and deployed in\n   networks, endpoints or elsewhere - rather,
    engineers should be aware\n   that they need to be detectable (either by endpoints,
    security\n   appliances or network-based defences, or ideally all) to be\n   effective.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
