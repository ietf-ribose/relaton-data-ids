abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets
    and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured
    addresses on Ethernet networks. It also specifies the content of the Source/Target
    Link-layer Address option used in Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor
    Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect messages when those messages
    are transmitted on an Ethernet. This document replaces RFC 2464 "Transmission
    of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks", which will become historic.</p>
