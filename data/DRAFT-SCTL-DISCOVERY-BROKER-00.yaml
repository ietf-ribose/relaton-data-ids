abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS-Based Service Discovery allows clients to discover available\n
    \  services using unicast DNS queries.  In simple configurations these\n   unicast
    DNS queries go directly to the appropriate authoritative\n   server(s).  In large
    networks that have complicated topology, or\n   many client devices, or both,
    it can be advantageous to have an\n   intermediary between the clients and authoritative
    servers.  This\n   intermediary, called a Discovery Broker, serves several purposes.\n
    \  A Discovery Broker can reduce load on both the servers and the\n   clients,
    and gives the option of presenting clients with service\n   discovery organized
    around logical, rather than physical, topology.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
