abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP)\n   cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, \"the\n
    \  route reflection approach may not yield the same route selection\n   result
    as that of the full IBGP mesh approach.\"  One practical\n   implication of this
    assertion is that the deployment of route\n   reflection may thwart the ability
    to achieve hot potato routing.  Hot\n   potato routing attempts to direct traffic
    to the closest AS egress\n   point in cases where no higher priority policy dictates
    otherwise.\n   As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of
    exit\n   point for a route reflector and its clients will be the egress point\n
    \  closest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to the\n   RR
    clients.\n\n   Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set
    of\n   constraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment of\n   route
    reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh\n   approach.  Such
    a deployment approach would make route reflection\n   compatible with the application
    of hot potato routing policy.\n\n   As networks evolved to accommodate architectural
    requirements of new\n   services, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized
    route\n   reflectors became commonplace.  This is one type of common deployment\n
    \  where it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described in\n   Section
    11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment, hot potato\n   routing policy remains
    desirable.\n\n   This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed
    to\n   facilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralized\n   route
    reflection deployments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
