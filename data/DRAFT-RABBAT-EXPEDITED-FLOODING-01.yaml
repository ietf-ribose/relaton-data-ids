abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Optical transport networks require fast restoration mechanisms
    with \ntight time bounds in order to recover from resource failures in a \ntimely
    manner.  These failures may include fiber cuts, transponder \nfailure and node
    failures.  Time-bounded recovery is challenging in \nmesh-based transport networks
    with shared protection.  This draft \ndiscusses some currently available mechanisms
    and their limitations, \nand explains the need for an expedited flooding mechanism
    to \naccomplish this objective.  The draft also highlights some \nchallenges,
    mitigating factors, and possible solutions in the \nimplementation of an expedited
    flooding protocol.\n\t </p>\n      "
