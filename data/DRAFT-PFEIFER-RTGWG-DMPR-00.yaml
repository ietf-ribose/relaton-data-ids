abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector
    routing\n   protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing.\n
    \  It has been designed from scratch to work at both low and high\n   bandwidth
    networks - even with high packet loss.  The objective was\n   to keep routing
    overhead low and ensure a deterministic upper limit.\n   DMPR can be used to manage
    huge networks with a similar feature set\n   as BGPv4 except for the concept of
    autonomous systems.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
