abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a source address validation solution
    for WLAN\n   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms.  This mechanism snoops\n
    \  NDP and DHCP packets to bind IP address to MAC address, and relies on\n   the
    security of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms\n   to filter
    IP spoofing packets.  It can work in the special situations\n   described in the
    charter of SAVI(Source Address Validation\n   Improvements) workgroup, such as
    multiple MAC addresses on one\n   interface.  This document describes three different
    deployment\n   scenarios, with solutions for migration of binding entries when
    hosts\n   move from one access point to another.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
