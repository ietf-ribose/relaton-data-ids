abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies the details of the Session Security Envelope\n
    \  (SSE).  SSE is a session protocol aiming to guarantee\n   confidentiality,
    integrity and authentication completely\n   independently by the underlying context,
    namely network and transport\n   layers.  A single session using the SEE protocol
    can include a single\n   transport session or multiple transport sessions.  This
    mean that SSE\n   can survive the break-down in network and transport layers or
    to\n   attacks carried against them.  SSE is also applicable in networks\n   lacking
    in classic inter-networking and transport protocols SSE\n   relies on modern AEAD
    block cipher modes of operations, a class of\n   block cipher modes which allows,
    at the same time, to authenticate\n   the message while encrypting a part of it.\n\n\t
