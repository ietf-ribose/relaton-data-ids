abstract:
- content: "<p>The CLUE protocol is an application protocol conceived for the description
    and negotiation of a CLUE telepresence session. The design of the CLUE protocol
    takes into account the requirements and the framework defined, respectively, in
    [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] and [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements]. The companion
    document [I-D.kyzivat-clue-signaling] delves into CLUE signaling details, as well
    as into the SIP/SDP session establishment phase. We herein focus on the application
    level perspective. Message details, together with the behavior of CLUE participants
    acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers, are discussed.</p>"
