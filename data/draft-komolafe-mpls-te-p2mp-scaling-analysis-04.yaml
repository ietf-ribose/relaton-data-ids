abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed
    in providers' core networks, and the scaling properties have been analyzed to
    show how much control state must be maintained to support a full mesh of edge-to-edge
    point-to-point (P2P) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies
    and with several different scaling techniques. Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE
    LSPs are very interesting to service providers as a means to provide multicast
    services (such as TV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core
    MPLS networks. P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs, and
    service providers need to understand whether existing protocols and implementations
    can support the network sizes and service levels that they are planning in their
    P2MP MPLS-TE networks. This document presents an analysis of the scaling properties
    MPLS-TE core networks that support P2MP LSPs.</p>"
