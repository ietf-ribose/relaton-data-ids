abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) isdeployed
    in providers' core networks, and the scaling propertieshave been analyzed to show
    how much control state must be maintainedto support a full mesh of edge-to-edge
    point-to-point (P2P) LabelSwitched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies
    and with severaldifferent scaling techniques.Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE
    LSPs are very interesting toservice providers as a means to provide multicast
    services (such asTV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core MPLSnetworks.
    P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs,and service providers
    need to understand whether existing protocolsand implementations can support the
    network sizes and service levelsthat they are planning in their P2MP MPLS-TE networks.This
    document presents an analysis of the scaling properties MPLS-TEcore networks that
    support P2MP LSPs.</p>"
