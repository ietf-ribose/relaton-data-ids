abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates,
    made up\n   of primary keys, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity\n   certifications
    (\"signature packets\"), subkeys, and so on.  They are\n   often assembled by
    merging multiple certificates that all share the\n   same primary key, and are
    distributed in public keystores.\n\n   Unfortunately, since many keystores permit
    any third-party to add a\n   certification with any content to any OpenPGP certificate,
    the\n   assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or\n   undistributable.
    \ Furthermore, keystores that are searched by user ID\n   or fingerprint can be
    made unusable for specific searches by public\n   submission of bogus certificates.
    \ And finally, keystores open to\n   public submission can also face simple resource
    exhaustion from\n   flooding with bogus submissions, or legal or other risks from
    uploads\n   of toxic data.\n\n   This draft documents techniques that an archive
    of OpenPGP\n   certificates can use to mitigate the impact of these various attacks,\n
    \  and the implications of these concerns and mitigations for the rest\n   of
    the OpenPGP ecosystem.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
