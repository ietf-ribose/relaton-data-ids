abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) with large portions of negotiation aspects eliminated, thus providing
    benefits such as quick provisioning as well as improved control and flexibility
    to network nodes initiating the path monitoring.</p>"
