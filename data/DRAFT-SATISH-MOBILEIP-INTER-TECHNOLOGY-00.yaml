abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Multi mode terminals are becoming pervasive. In a multi mode \nenvironment,
    Mobile Terminals (MTs) move from the coverage of one radio \naccess network to
    another. There is a need to maintain ongoing network \nsessions to support seamless
    services. For example, a MT may roam \nbetween a 3G cellular network and a wireless
    LAN seamlessly with \nsession continuity. It is possible for a single service
    provider to \nsupport multiple modes but it is expected that different modes will
    be \nsupported by different service providers. For example WLAN support can \nbe
    enterprise supported where as 3G services are supported by a wide \narea service
    provider. In this draft we discuss handover support \nbetween multiple domains
    (modes) where a MT can use different IP \naddresses or can use a global IP address.
    Handover between different \nmodes will then require greater federation capabilities
    between the \ndifferent IP domains. \n\nIn this draft we discuss Home Agent federation
    capabilities over Mobile \nIP so that inter-technology, inter-domain handovers
    are better \nsupported.\n\t </p>\n      "
