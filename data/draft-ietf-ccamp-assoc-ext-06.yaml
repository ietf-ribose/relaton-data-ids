abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS-controlled
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this context, the object is used to associate
    recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting. This object also has broader applicability
    as a mechanism to associate RSVP state. This document defines how the ASSOCIATION
    object can be more generally applied. This document also defines Extended ASSOCIATION
    objects that, in particular, can be used in the context of the MPLS Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP). This document updates RFC 2205, RFC 3209, and RFC 3473. It
    also generalizes the definition of the Association ID field defined in RFC 4872.
