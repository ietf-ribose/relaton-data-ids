abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With Segment Routing (SR) architecture [rfc8402], a unicast
    flow can\n   be routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified\n
    \  in the packet, w/o the need for per-flow state in the network.  As a\n   result,
    the otherwise needed protocols to signal the per-flow unicast\n   state can also
    be removed from the network.  This document discusses\n   options for multicast
    in an SR network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
