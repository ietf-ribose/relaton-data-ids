abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is\n
    \  described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two\n   Label
    Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the\n   labels used to forward
    traffic between and through them.  This common\n   understanding is achieved by
    using a set of procedures, called a\n   label distribution protocol, by which
    one LSR informs another of\n   label bindings it has made.  This document defines
    a set of such\n   procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which
    LSRs\n   distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed\n
    \  paths.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
