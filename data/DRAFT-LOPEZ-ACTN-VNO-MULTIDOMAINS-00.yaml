abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n
    \  facilitating the application of virtual network abstractions to\n   network
    operation. These abstractions shall create a virtualized\n   environment supporting
    operators in viewing and controlling\n   different domains (at any dimension:
    applied technology,\n   administrative zones, or vendor-specific technology islands)
    as a\n   single virtualized network.  Such an approach will facilitate the\n   deployment
    of NFV (Network Function Virtualization) mechanisms, and\n   accelerate rapid
    service deployment of new services, including more\n   dynamic and elastic services,
    and improve overall network operations\n   and scaling of existing services.\n\n
    \  This use-case considers the application of these abstractions within\n   the
    network of a single operator.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
