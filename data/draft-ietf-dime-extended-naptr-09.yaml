abstract:
- content: <p>The Diameter base protocol specifies mechanisms whereby a given realm
    may advertise Diameter nodes and the supported transport protocol. However, these
    mechanisms do not reveal the Diameter applications that each node supports. A
    peer outside the realm would have to perform a Diameter capability exchange with
    every node until it discovers one that supports the required application. This
    document updates RFC 3588, "Diameter Base Protocol", and describes an improvement
    using an extended format for the Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR)
    application service tag that allows for discovery of the supported applications
    without doing Diameter capability exchange beforehand. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
