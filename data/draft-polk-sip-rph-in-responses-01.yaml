abstract:
  content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource-Priority Header is ignored
    in SIP responses, according to RFC 4412. This was a design choice during RFC 4412's
    development. This is now considered a bad design choice in certain scenarios.
    This document corrects RFC 4412's communications model by optionally allowing
    a SIP server or user agent (UA) to process the Resource-Priority Header in a response.
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
