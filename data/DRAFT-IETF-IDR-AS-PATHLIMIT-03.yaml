abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the 'AS path limit' (AS_PATHLIMIT)
    path\n   attribute for BGP.  This is an optional, transitive path attribute\n
    \  that is designed to help limit the distribution of routing\n   information
    in the Internet.\n\n   By default, prefixes advertised into the BGP graph are
    distributed\n   freely, and if not blocked by policy will propagate globally.
    \ This\n   is harmful to the scalability of the routing subsystem since\n   information
    that only has a local effect on routing will cause state\n   creation throughout
    the default-free zone.  This attribute can be\n   attached to a particular path
    to limit its scope to a subset of the\n   Internet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
