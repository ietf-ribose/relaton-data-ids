abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses color-based tunnel selection for BGP
    payload\n   prefixes.  It defines a set of extended mapping modes, and describes\n
    \  how to use these modes to construct tunnel selection schemes to\n   achieve
    flexible tunnel selection.  Tunnel selection schemes can be\n   implemented as
    policies on routers performing tunnel selection, or\n   signaled by next hop routers
    or a central controller via BGP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
