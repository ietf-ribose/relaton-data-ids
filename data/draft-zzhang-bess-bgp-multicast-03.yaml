abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a BGP address family and related procedures
    that allow BGP to be used for setting up multicast distribution trees. This document
    also specifies procedures that enable BGP to be used for multicast source discovery,
    and for showing interest in receiving particular multicast flows. Taken together,
    these procedures allow BGP to be used as a replacement for other multicast routing
    protocols, such as PIM or mLDP. The BGP procedures specified here are based on
    the BGP multicast procedures that were originally designed for use by providers
    of Multicast Virtual Private Network service.</p>"
