abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standardstrack
    within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, thelevel of vendor support
    and deployment has been relatively slow,despite the desire of many to deploy technology
    to deliver serviceswith different levels of quality of service (QoS) to their
    customers.The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and documented andare
    not the focus of this memo. This memo seeks to initiate a dialogabout the design
    of a new version of RSVPv1, which we call RSVPv2.The RSVPv2 framework could use
    the combination of two concepts. Theconcept of ALSP (Application Layer Signaling
    Protocol) and theconcept of Common Signaling Transport Protocol (CSTP).This memo
    outlines the motivation for doing this work and providesdesign guidelines and
    specifications for the development of theRSVPv2 ALSP. RSVPv2 ALSP is an ALSP type
    that can be a part of theRSVPv2 framework.</p>"
