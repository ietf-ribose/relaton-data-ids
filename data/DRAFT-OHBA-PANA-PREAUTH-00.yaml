abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an extension to the PANA protocol used
    for\n   proactively establishing a PANA SA (Security Association) between a\n
    \  PaC in an access network and a PAA in another access network to which\n   the
    PaC may move.  The proposed method operates across multiple\n   administrative
    domains.\n\t </p>\n      "
