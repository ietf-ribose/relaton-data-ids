abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format\n
    \  whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code\n   size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need\n   for version
    negotiation.  These design goals make it different from\n   earlier binary serializations
    such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.\n\n   This document is a revised edition of RFC
    7049, with editorial\n   improvements, added detail, and fixed errata.  This revision
    formally\n   obsoletes RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the\n   interchange
    format from RFC 7049.  It does not create a new version\n   of the format.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
