abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A PANA authentication protocol is under development in the PANAWorking
    Group. It will allow hosts to authenticate with PANAAuthentication Agents (PAAs).
    The protocol is expected to run oversome IP-based transport protocol, such as
    ICMP, UDP, TCP or SCTP.Before a host can authenticate with a PAA, it must obtain
    an IP-address of the PAA. This document specifies such a 'discovery'mechanism
    by defining extensions (or options) to RouterAdvertisements and DHCP messages
    for both IPv4 and IPv6. Hosts MAYalso obtain an identity of a PAA and other information
    during thediscovery process. The proposed discovery mechanism makes noassumptions
    about the location of a PAA, and more than one PAA maybe discovered.</p>"
