abstract:
- content: <p>5G Network slicing is an approach to provide separate independent end-to-end
    logical network from User Equipment (UE) to various mobile applications where
    each network slice has its own Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Objectives (SLO)
    requirements. Each end-to-end network slice consists of a multitude of contexts
    across RAN, Core and transport domains each with its own controller. To provide
    automation, assurance and optimization of the 5G the network slices, a 5G E2E
    network slice orchestrator is needed which interacts with controllers in RAN,
    Core and Transport network domains. The interfaces between the 5G E2E network
    slice orchestrator and RAN and Core controllers are defined in various 3GPP technical
    specifications. However, 3GPP has not defined a similar interface for transport
    network. The aim of this document is to describe E2E network slicing and its relation
    to "IETF network slice" for 5G use-case. It also provides an information model
    for control and mangement of IETF network slices for 5G.</p>
