abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. RFC 6374
    specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement
    of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as
    delay variation in MPLS networks using probe messages. This document utilizes
    these mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss Measurements in Segment Routing
    (SR) networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR links and end-to-end
    SR Policies. In addition, this document defines Return Path TLV for two-way performance
    measurement and Block Number TLV for loss measurement.</p>"
