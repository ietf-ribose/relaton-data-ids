abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC8402 introduces Segment Routing architecture that leverages
    source\n   routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the\n
    \  Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  A node steers a\n   packet
    through a controlled set of instructions called segments, by\n   prepending the
    packet with Segment Routing header.  SR architecture\n   defines different types
    of segments with different forwarding\n   semantics associated.\n\n   RFC8287
    defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute for\n   Segment Routing
    IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier\n   (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane.
    \ RFC8287 defines the Target FEC Stack\n   Sub-TLVs and the procedures to apply
    RFC8029 on SR architecture with\n   MPLS data plane.\n\n   This document defines
    the Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs and the extension\n   required for other SR Segments.\n\n\t
