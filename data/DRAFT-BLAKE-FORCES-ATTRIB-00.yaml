abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The ForCES Forwarding Element Model [Model] defines a model
    and\n   schema for representing Logical Functional Block (LFB) classes and\n   their
    operational and capability attributes.  The operational\n   attributes of LFB
    instances within a Forwarding Element (FE) are\n   manipulated by the ForCES protocol
    [ForCES] to configure the\n   operation of the FE.  The model assumes that any
    particular LFB\n   attribute is owned and accessed exclusively by a single LFB
    instance.\n   While this is a simple and clean restriction, we observe that it\n
    \  imposes some complications when defining LFBs.  This memo addresses\n   these
    complications and proposes that the restriction be re-examined.\n\t </p>\n      "
