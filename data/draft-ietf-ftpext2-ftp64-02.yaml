abstract:
- content: "<p>The File transfer protocol(FTP) has a long histroy,, but still being
    widely used. The first concept of FTP was described RFC 114, and then was specified
    in RFC 354. FTP can work in IPv4 environment and then was extended to IPv6. RFC
    2428 defines IPv6 extensions of FTP. In the IPv6-IPv4 translation scenario, considerations
    should be applied to FTP client, server and translation box to ensure FTP protocol
    work properly. This document discusses the details for FTP to work in IPv4-IPv6
    transitiion scenario. This document gives recommendation regarding how IPv6 FTP
    client should behave in 6to4 scenario.</p>"
