abstract:
- content: <p>The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's machine
    is configured with the user's identities. This will require something on that
    machine which will manage the user's identities and services. Anyone designing
    that "something" will face the same set of challenges. This document aims to document
    these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some consistency.</p>
