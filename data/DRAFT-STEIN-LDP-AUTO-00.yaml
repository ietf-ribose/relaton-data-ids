abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Current L2VPN implementations that use LDP for label binding
    require\n   another protocol to dynamically detect which PEs belong to a given\n
    \  VPN.  We herein propose a simple extension to LDP consisting of a\n   message
    with which a PE announces its desire to join an existing VPN.\n   The technique
    is equally applicable to HVPLS, multisegment VPLS and\n   VPWS, and may be especially
    attractive for access networks employing\n   MPLS.\n\t </p>\n      "
