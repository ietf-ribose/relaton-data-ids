abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless\n
    \  Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  It\n   provides
    a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs\n   for connectionless
    protocols.  The base model presented here can be\n   extended to include technology
    specific details.  This is leading to\n   uniformity between OAM protocols and
    support both nested OAM\n   workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different
    or same levels\n   through a unified interface).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
