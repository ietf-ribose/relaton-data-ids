abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based\n   applications
    and services easier.  The specification suite builds\n   upon experience with
    existing schemas and deployments, placing\n   specific emphasis on simplicity
    of development and integration, while\n   applying existing authentication, authorization,
    and privacy models.\n   Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user
    management\n   operations by providing a common user schema and extension model,
    as\n   well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this\n   schema
    using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap,\n   and easy to move
    identity in to, out of, and around the cloud.\n\n   This document provides a platform
    neutral schema and extension model\n   for representing users and groups in JSON
    format.  This schema is\n   intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers.\n
    \  Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML\n   binding,
    and use cases.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
