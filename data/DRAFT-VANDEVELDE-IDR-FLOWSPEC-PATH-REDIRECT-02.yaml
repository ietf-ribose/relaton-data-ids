abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of\n   traffic flow specification rules.  This has many possible\n   applications
    but the primary one for many network operators is the\n   distribution of traffic
    filtering actions for DDoS mitigation.  The\n   flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2]
    defines a redirect-to-VRF action for\n   policy-based forwarding but this mechanism
    is not always sufficient,\n   particular if the redirected traffic needs to be
    steered into an\n   engineered path or into a service plane.\n\n   This document
    defines a new redirect-to-INDIRECTION_ID (32-bit or\n   128-bit) flow-spec action
    to provide advanced redirection\n   capabilities.  When activated, the flowspec
    Indirection-id is used to\n   identify the next-hop redirect information within
    a router locallized\n   Indirection-id table.  This allows a flowspec controller
    to signal\n   redirection towards a next-hop IP address, a shortest path tunnel,
    a\n   traffic engineered tunnel or a next-next-hop engineered tunnel\n   interface.\n\n\n\t
