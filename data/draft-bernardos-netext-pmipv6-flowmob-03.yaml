abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized mobility management
    protocol that enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across
    gateways without changing their IP addresses. PMIPv6 basic specification also
    provides limited multi- homing support to multi-mode mobile devices. The ability
    of movement of selected flows from one access technology to another is missing
    in basic PMIPv6. This document describes enhancements to the Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol that are required to support flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.</p>"
