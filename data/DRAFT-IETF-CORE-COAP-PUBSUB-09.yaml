abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions\n
    \  are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems\n   where
    one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for\n   low power wireless
    sensor networks.  This document defines a publish-\n   subscribe Broker for CoAP
    that extends the capabilities of CoAP for\n   supporting nodes with long breaks
    in connectivity and/or up-time.\n\n   There is work in progress to resolve some
    of the transfer layer\n   issues by using a more RESTful approach.\n\n   Please
    see https://github.com/core-wg/pubsub/blob/master/proposal.txt\n\n\t </p>\n      "
