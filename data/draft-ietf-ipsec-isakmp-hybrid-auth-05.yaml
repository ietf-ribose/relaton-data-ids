abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of new authentication methods to be used
    within Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The proposed methods assume
    an asymmetry between the authenticating entities. One entity, typically an Edge
    Device (e.g. firewall), authenticates using standard public key techniques (in
    signature mode), while the other entity, typically a remote User, authenticates
    using challenge response techniques. These authentication methods are used to
    establish, at the end of Phase 1, an IKE SA which is unidirectionally authenticated.
    To make this IKE bi-directionally authenticated, this Phase 1 is immediately followed
    by an X-Auth Exchange [XAUTH]. The X-Auth Exchange is used to authenticate the
    remote User. The use of these authentication methods is referred to as Hybrid
    Authentication mode. This proposal is designed to provide a solution for environments
    where a legacy authentication system exists, yet a full public key infrastructure
    is not deployed.</p>"
