abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a set of new authentication methods to beused
    within Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The proposedmethods assume
    an asymmetry between the authenticating entities. Oneentity, typically an Edge
    Device (e.g. firewall), authenticates usingstandard public key techniques (in
    signature mode), while the otherentity, typically a remote User, authenticates
    using challengeresponse techniques. These authentication methods are used toestablish,
    at the end of Phase 1, an IKE SA which is unidirectionallyauthenticated. To make
    this IKE bi-directionally authenticated, thisPhase 1 is immediately followed by
    an X-Auth Exchange [XAUTH]. TheX-Auth Exchange is used to authenticate the remote
    User. The use ofthese authentication methods is referred to as Hybrid Authenticationmode.This
    proposal is designed to provide a solution for environmentswhere a legacy authentication
    system exists, yet a full public keyinfrastructure is not deployed.</p>"
