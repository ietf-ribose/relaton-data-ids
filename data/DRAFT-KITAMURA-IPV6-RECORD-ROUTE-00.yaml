abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes a 'Record Route for IPv6 (RR6)' mechanism.
    \ It\nis composed of one new IPv6 hop-by-hop option (RR6 option) extension.\nThe
    RR6 mechanism is redesigned to establish an optimized record\nroute mechanism
    for IPv6. Two types of new features are introduced.\n1. In order to prevent scalability
    problems and to make the mechanism\nflexible, the beginning and ending points
    of the data recording range\nare controlled by using their specifiers.\n2. In
    order to record long IPv6 addresses efficiently, a simple\naddress compression
    method is introduced. Since the compression is\nachieved by utilizing characteristics
    of recorded IPv6 addresses\neffectively, the mechanism is efficient and optimized
    for IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
