abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4-over-IPv6 tunneling transition mechanisms provide both IPv4 and
    IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co- existing period.
    The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPv6) options has been extended
    and defined to configure tunnel initiator (TI) in lightweight 4over6. However,
    in many networks, the configuration information are stored in Authentication Authorization
    and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband
    Network Gateway (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol. Thus AAA server as a database can
    be extended to establish and store the whole information of tunnels and help the
    tunnel concentrator (TC) recover in failure. This document defines the mechanism
    and the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry
    TI configuration information from AAA server to BNG and the tunnel configuration
    information from AAA server to TC.</p>"
