abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a standardized framework for implementing
    the\n   massive data migration between traditional databases and big-data\n   platforms
    on the cloud via Internet, especially for an instance of\n   Hadoop data architecture.
    \ The main goal of the framework is to\n   provide more concise and friendly interfaces
    for users more easily\n   and quickly migrate the massive data from a relational
    database to a\n   distributed platform for a variety of requirements, in order
    to make\n   full use of distributed storage resource and distributed computing\n
    \  capability to solve the bottleneck problems of both storage and\n   computing
    performance in traditional enterprise-level applications.\n   This document covers
    the fundamental architecture, data elements\n   specification, operations, and
    interface related to massive data\n   migration.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
