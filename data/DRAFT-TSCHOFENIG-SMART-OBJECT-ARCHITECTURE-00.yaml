abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Following the theme \"Everything that can be connected will
    be\n   connected\", engineers and researchers designing smart object networks\n
    \  need to decide how to achieve this in practice.  How can different\n   forms
    of embedded and constrained devices be interconnected?  How can\n   they employ
    and interact with the currently deployed Internet?  This\n   memo discusses smart
    objects and some of the architectural choices\n   involved in designing smart
    object networks and protocols that they\n   use.\n\n   The document is being discussed
    at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/architecture-discuss\n\n\t </p>\n
