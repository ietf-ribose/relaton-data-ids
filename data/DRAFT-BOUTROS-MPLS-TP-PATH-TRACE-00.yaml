abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies method for verifying the connection of
    an \nMPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for \nmanagement
    purpose. The proposed extension is based on MPLS \nOperation, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM). The goal is to \nverify that an MPLS-TP LSP is properly
    setup in both control and data \n\n planes, as well as to record the identities
    of all the LSRs along the \npath of MPLS-TP LSP.\n\t </p>\n      "
