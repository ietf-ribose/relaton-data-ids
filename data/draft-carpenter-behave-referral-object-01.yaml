    to pass information to another party. This memospecifies a Generic Referral Object
    (GRO) to be used in the contextof referrals. The proposed object is compact and
    is application-independent. Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported, as well
    asupper layer identifiers. Additional information to characterise anenclosed reference
    is also described. To allow proper interpretationof referrals, a new notion of
    scope identifiers is introduced.</p>"
