abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of
    a single\n   best path for each prefix.  As defined and widely deployed today
    BGP\n   has no mechanisms to distribute alternate paths which are not\n   considered
    best path between its speakers.  This behaviour results in\n   number of disadvantages
    for new applications and services.\n\n   This document presents an alternative
    mechanism for solving the\n   problem based on the concept of parallel route reflector
    planes.\n   Such planes can be built in parallel or they can co-exist on the\n
    \  current route reflection platforms.  Document also compares existing\n   solutions
    and proposed ideas that enable distribution of more paths\n   than just the best
    path.\n\n   This proposal does not specify any changes to the BGP protocol\n   definition.
    \ It does not require upgrades to provider edge or core\n   routers nor does it
    need network wide upgrades.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
