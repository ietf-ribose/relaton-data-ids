abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select
    the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user agent's characteristics,
    as expressed in request headers. In practice, clients are often unwilling to send
    those request headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and
    sending them impacts both performance and privacy. This document defines two response
    headers, Accept-CH and Accept-CH- Lifetime, that servers can use to advertise
    their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation, along with a set
    of guidelines for the creation of such headers, colloquially known as "Client
    Hints." It also defines an initial set of Client Hints.</p>
