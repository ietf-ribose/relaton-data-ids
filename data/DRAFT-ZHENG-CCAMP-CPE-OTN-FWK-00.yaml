abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The term Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) describes the terminals\n
    \  that are associated with a carrier's telecommunication network. The\n   CPE
    provides access between a customer's devices and the network.\n\n   This document
    describes the framework for control of CPEs in optical\n   transport networks.
    Gap analysis is also included as guidance for\n   potential solutions such as
    protocol extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
