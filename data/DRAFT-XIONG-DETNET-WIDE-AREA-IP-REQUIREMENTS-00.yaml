abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In wide-area IP networks, more requirements need to be taken
    into\n   considerations such as differentiated DetNet QoS of multiple\n   services,
    high-efficiency of resources utilization and routes\n   steering, integration
    of large-scale heterogeneous network and\n   guarantees of multiple dynamic deterministic
    flows.  This document\n   describes the requirements in wide-area applications
    and proposes the\n   solution with deterministic resources, routes and QoS.\n\n\t
