abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses setting up special-purpose transport connections\n
    \  using existing IETF technologies.  These connections are called\n   transport
    slices for the purposes of this memo.  The memo discusses\n   the general framework
    for this setup, the necessary system components\n   and interfaces, and how abstract
    requests can be mapped to more\n   specific technologies.  The memo also discusses
    related\n   considerations with monitoring and security.\n\n   This memo is intended
    for discussing interfaces and technologies.  It\n   is not intended to be a new
    set of concrete interfaces or\n   technologies.  Rather, it should be seen as
    an explanation of how\n   some existing, concrete IETF VPN and traffic-engineering
    technologies\n   can be used to create transport slices.  Note that there are
    a number\n   of these technologies, and new technologies or capabilities keep\n
    \  being added.  This memo is also not intended presume any particular\n   technology
    choice.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
