abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES
    NE). RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the
    capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context
    of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.
    More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present
    in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are
    or can be interconnected. RFC5812 has been around for two years and experience
    in its use has shown room for small extensions without a need to alter the protocol
    while retaining backward compatibility with older xml libraries. This document
    extends the model to allow complex datatypes for metadata, optional default values
    for datatypes and optional access types for structures. The document also introduces
    three new features, bitmap as a new datatype, a new event condition BecomesEqualTo
    and LFB properties.</p>"
