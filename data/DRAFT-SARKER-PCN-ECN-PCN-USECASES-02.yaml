abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document provides an informative overview of possible use
    cases\nwhere ECN marking can be used for inelastic traffic.  It outlines\nbenefits
    of preserving the ECN support in a PCN domain.  As ECN\nprovides with a simple
    mechanism for network nodes to inform the end\npoints about possible upcoming
    congestion and resulting packet losses\nand delay increase, the scheme can be
    useful for adaptive real-time\nmedia applications, thus enabling them to adjust
    the transmission\nrate to avoid quality degradation due to congestion.  By showing
    the\nbenefits of ECN this memo asks the working group to consider end to\nend
    ECN support in PCN domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
