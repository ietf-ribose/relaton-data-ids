abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a common implementation-independent basis for
    the interoperable application of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol
    to the handling of Aggregated Flows, which are IPFIX Flows representing packets
    from multiple Original Flows sharing some set of common properties. It does this
    through a detailed terminology and a descriptive Intermediate Aggregation Process
    architecture, including a specification of methods for Original Flow counting
    and counter distribution across intervals.</p>"
