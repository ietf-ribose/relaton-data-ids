abstract:
  content: "<p>Limiting and preventing SPAM for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is seen
    asan important task for future security work in the Voice over IPenvironment.
    This document addresses the problem by utilizing theconcept introduced by the
    SIP Identity Framework in combination withthe Security Assertion Markup Language
    (SAML) to warrant certainsecurity relevant attributes from one administrative
    domain toanother. This approach allows the destination domain to makeintelligent
    filtering decisions when receiving voice calls.</p>"
