abstract:
  content: "\t <t>A number of existing clients and servers currently support the'poppassd'
    protocol for changing passwords. This protocol isextremely insecure, as it transmits
    the user name, current and newpasswords in clear text. It also has more round-trips
    than needed,and lacks an extension mechanism. In addition, it is not possibleto
    specify for which service(s) the password is to be changed. Theprotocol also traditionally
    usurps port 106, which is actuallyassigned for a different purpose.</p>"
