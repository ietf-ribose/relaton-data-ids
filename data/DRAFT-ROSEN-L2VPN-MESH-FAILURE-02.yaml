abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Certain L2VPN architectures [IPLS, VPLS] rely on there being a
    full\nmesh of pseudowires [PWE3-ARCH] among a set of entities.  This mesh\nis
    used to provide a 'LAN-like' service among the entities.  If one\nor more of these
    pseudowires is absent, so that there is not really a\nfull mesh, various higher
    layers (from routing to bridge control\nprotocols) that expect a LAN-like service
    may fail to work as\nexpected.  Therefore it is desirable to have procedures that
    enable\nthe pseudowire endpoints to determine automatically whether there is\nreally
    a full mesh or not.  It is also desirable to have procedures\nthat cause the L2VPNs
    to adapt to pseudowire failures.  This document\nproposes a set of procedures
    to meet these goals.  Detailed protocol\nencodings are not present, but will be
    added in future versions.\n\t </p>\n      "
