abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DMARC allows for domain holders to request aggregate reports
    from\n   receivers.  This report is an XML document, and contains extensible\n
    \  elements that allow for other types of data to be specified later.\n   The
    aggregate reports can be submitted to the domain holder's\n   specified destination
    as supported by the receiver.\n\n   This document (along with others) obsoletes
    RFC7489.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
