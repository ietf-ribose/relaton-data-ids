abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance
    criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE Label Switched
    Path (LSP). Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss or
    other indications such as the conformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP
    TE traffic load. This specification describes how a path computation function
    may use network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and IS-IS
    TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to perform such
    path selections.</p>"
