abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility protocol
    thatenables mobility management for an IP host as it moves acrossdifferent points
    of attachment within the mobility domain. An IPhost whose mobility is being managed
    by the network is unaware of theaccess networks capability providing PMIPv6 mobility
    management onits behalf. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host isinformed
    of PMIPv6, as well as means to actively discover suchcapability in the network
    the host is attaching to. The ability ofthe host to discover or be aware of PMIPv6
    support in the accessnetwork enables better decision making in terms of the networkselection,
    attach procedure, choice of mobility management, as wellas the service/session
    and even application configuration abilities.</p>"
