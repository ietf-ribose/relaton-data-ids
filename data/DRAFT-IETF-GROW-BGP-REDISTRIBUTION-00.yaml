abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes the redistribution extended community.
    \ This\nnew extended community allows a router to influence how a specific\nroute
    should be redistributed towards a specified set of eBGP\nspeakers. Several types
    of redistribution communities are proposed.\nThe first type may be used to indicate
    that a specific route should\nnot be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions.
    The second\ntype may be used to indicate that the attached route should only be\nannounced
    with the NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGP\nsessions and the
    third type may be used to indicate that the attached\nroute should be prepended
    n times when announced over a specified set\nof eBGP sessions.\n\t </p>\n      "
