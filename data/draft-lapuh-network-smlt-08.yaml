abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes Split Multi-link Trunking (SMLT) for bridgedand
    routed networks. SMLT enables topologies with upstream noderedundancy for increased
    reliability of Layer 2 link aggregationsubnetworks based on [IEEE 802.3ad] and
    router redundancy based onVRRP [RFC3768].SMLT is an improvement over Multi-Link
    Trunking (MLT), a method oflink aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet links
    to be aggregatedtogether, and handled as a single logical trunk. MLT can be realizedvia
    many different link aggregation mechanisms. Several methods ofMLT are in use today;
    one example is [IEEE 802.3ad].SMLT is MLT with links of a link-aggregation group
    connected to portson two different devices (e.g. SMLT client and aggregation device).Unlike
    MLT, at least one end of a link-aggregated group is dual-homedto two different
    SMLT aggregation devices. In many cases thosedevices act as bridges (switches)
    as well as L3 routers (RoutingSwitches). These two redundant SMLT aggregation
    devices can share oneor more VRRP routing instances; for that SMLT-VRRP extends
    the VRRPfunctionality to an active-active router concept, where both SMLTaggregation
    device route traffic for a common VRRP-ID, thus loadbalancing traffic not only
    for L2 but also for L3.Conventions used in this documentThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in thisdocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119.</p>"
