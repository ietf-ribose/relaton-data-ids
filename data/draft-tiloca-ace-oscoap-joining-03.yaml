abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to join a group where communications
    are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE). The proposed method delegates the authentication and authorization of
    client nodes that join an OSCORE group through a Group Manager server. This approach
    builds on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages
    protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession
    and server authentication.</p>"
