abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL legacy\n
    \  networks via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs.\n   Appointed
    Forwarder provides load sharing based on VLAN with an\n   active-standby model.
    Mission critical operations such as High\n   Performance Data Centers require
    active-active load sharing model.\n   Active-Active load sharing model can be
    accomplished by representing\n   any given non-TRILL legacy network with a single
    virtual RBridge.\n   Virtual representation of the non-TRILL legacy network with
    a single\n   RBridge poses serious challenges in multi-destination RPF (Reverse\n
    \  Path Forwarding) check calculations. This document specifies\n   required enhancements
    to build Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT)\n   within the TRILL campus to solve
    related RPF issues. CMT provides\n   flexibility to RBridges in selecting  desired
    path of association to\n   a given TRILL multi-destination distribution tree.\n\n\t
