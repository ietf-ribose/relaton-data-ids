abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection is defined
    in\n   [RFC6378].  That however is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection and is\n
    \  not able to care that the multiple failures are occurred on both\n   working
    and protection paths.\n\n   This document describes why we need to consider the
    case for multiple\n   failures, and lists some requirements for multi-failure
    protection\n   (MFP) functionality.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
