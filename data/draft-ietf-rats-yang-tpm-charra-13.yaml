abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG RPCs and a small number of configuration
    nodes required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from
    a device, following the operational context defined in TPM-based Network Device
    Remote Integrity Verification. Complementary measurement logs are also provided
    by the YANG RPCs, originating from one or more roots of trust for measurement
    (RTMs). The module defined requires at least one TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0 as well as
    a corresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), included in the device components of
    the composite device the YANG server is running on.</p>"
