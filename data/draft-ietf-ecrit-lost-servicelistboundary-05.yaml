abstract:
- content: "<p>Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and
    location information to service contact URIs. If a LoST client wants to discover
    available services for a particular location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt;
    query to the LoST server. However, the LoST server, in its response, does not
    provide context information; that is, it does not provide any additional information
    about the geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered
    valid. Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns a
    local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the
    client in not missing a change in available services when moving. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
