abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Layer 2 Access Networks, Access Concentrators are present
    between\n   DHCP Clients and Relay Agent.  In this case, the Relay Agent can not\n
    \  uniquely identify the end host and hence can not add unique 'Relay\n   Agent
    Information' option corresponding to the end hosts in DHCP\n   messages.  As the
    Access concentrators are closer to the end hosts,\n   they can uniquely identify
    the end hosts and add the Relay Agent\n   Information option in the DHCP message.
    \ Access concentrators do not\n   set the 'giaddr' field.  Access Concentrators
    in this mode are\n   typically known as Layer 2 Relay agents.\n\n   This document
    provides insight to the behavior of the Access\n   Concentrators which act as
    DHCP Layer 2 Relay Agents in Access\n   Networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
