abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The application-centric deployment of 'Internet' services has\n
    \  increased over the past ten years with many millions of applications\n   providing
    user-centric services, executed on increasingly more\n   powerful smartphones
    that are supported by Internet-based cloud\n   services in distributed data centres,
    the latter mainly provided by\n   large scale players such as Google, Amazon and
    alike. This draft\n   outlines a vision for evolving those data centres towards
    executing\n   app-centric micro-services; we dub this evolved data centre as an\n
    \  AppCentre. Complemented with the proliferation of such AppCentres at\n   the
    edge of the network, they will allow for such micro-services to\n   be distributed
    across many places of execution, including mobile\n   terminals themselves, while
    specific micro-service chains equal\n   today's applications in existing smartphones.
    We outline the key\n   enabling technologies that needs to be provided for such
    evolution to\n   be realized, including references to ongoing IETF work in some\n
    \  areas.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
