abstract:
- content: "<p>Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really
    being present for the participants. A number of techniques for handling audio
    and video streams are used to create this experience. When these techniques are
    not similar, interoperability between different systems is difficult at best,
    and often not possible. Conveying information about the relationships between
    multiple streams of media would allow senders and receivers to make choices to
    allow telepresence systems to interwork. This memo describes the most typical
    and important use cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence conference.</p>"
