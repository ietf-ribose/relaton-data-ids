abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo describes conventions for exchange and presentation
    of text\nin SIP sessions through the Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP.  It\ncovers
    two different methods for taking the initiative to transmit.\nThese methods are
    timer initiated real-time text and user requested\nen-bloc transmission in Messaging.
    \ The document gives specific\nguidance on handling of text presentation and presentation
    control of\nconversational sessions.  It specifies how the capability to conduct\nMSRP
    sessions with real-time text is declared so that session\nnegotiation can make
    decisions on what transport protocol to use and\nhow to route the calls to get
    the desired support for text\ncommunication.\n\t </p>\n      "
