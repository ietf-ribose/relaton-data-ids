abstract:
- content: "<p>Although TRILL is based on IS-IS, which supports multilevel unicast
    routing, extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not addressed
    by the already-existing capabilities of IS-IS. One issue is with the handling
    of multi-destination packet distribution trees. Other issues are with TRILL switch
    nicknames. How are such nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network?
    Do nicknames need to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network? Or can
    they merely be unique within each multilevel area? This informational document
    enumerates and examines alternatives based on a number of factors including backward
    compatibility, simplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases.</p>"
