abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a model for the lightweight use of
    SDP Offer/\n   Answer in WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer\n
    \  exchanges in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools\n   necessary
    to implement the signalling that they may need in a way\n   that best fits their
    custom requirements and topologies.  This\n   simplifies signalling of multiple
    media sources or providing RTP\n   Synchronisation source (SSRC) identification
    in multi-party sessions.\n   Another important goal of this model is to remove
    from clients\n   topological constraints such as the requirement to know in advance\n
    \  all SSRC identifiers that they could potentially introduce in a\n   particular
    session.\n\n   The model described here is similar to the one employed by the
    data\n   channel JavaScript APIs in WebRTC, where methods are supported on\n   PeerConnection
    without being reflected in SDP.\n\n   This document does not question the use
    of SDP and the Offer/Answer\n   model or the value they have in terms of interoperability
    with legacy\n   or other non-WebRTC devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
