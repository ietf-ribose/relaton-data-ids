abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent\n
    \  Web IDentifiers for web material in web archives using the 'pwid'\n   namespace
    identifier.\n\n   The main purpose of the standard is to support specification
    of\n   references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to\n   support
    references to material in web archives with restricted\n   access.  Furthermore,
    it supports persistent technology agnostic\n   references to web archives in general,
    in a form that can work as an\n   algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources
    in general.  An\n   additional important benefit is that the standard can be used
    for\n   specifying web collections, which can then form a persistent\n   computational
    basis for the extract of the archived collection parts.\n   Since these parts
    can be specified generally, this further allows\n   collections to be specified
    with elements from one or more web\n   archives.\n\n   The PWID URN is designed
    to meet requirements for proper referencing\n   needed by researchers.  Therefore,
    it is designed as general, global,\n   sustainable, humanly readable, technology
    agnostic, persistent and\n   precise web references for web materials in web archives.\n\n\t
