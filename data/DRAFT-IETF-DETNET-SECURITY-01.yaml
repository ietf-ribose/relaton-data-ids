abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for
    real-\n   time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded\n   latency.
    \ Deterministic networks have been successfully deployed in\n   real-time operational
    technology (OT) applications for some years\n   (for example [ARINC664P7]).  However,
    such networks are typically\n   isolated from external access, and thus the security
    threat from\n   external attackers is low.  IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet)\n
    \  specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of deterministic\n   networks
    on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale\n   of a corporate
    network) potentially bringing the OT network into\n   contact with Information
    Technology (IT) traffic and security threats\n   that lie outside of a tightly
    controlled and bounded area (such as\n   the internals of an aircraft).  These
    DetNet technologies have not\n   previously been deployed together on a wide area
    IP-based network,\n   and thus can present security considerations that may be
    new to IP-\n   based wide area network designers.  This draft, intended for use
    by\n   DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security\n   considerations.
    \ In addition, this draft collects all security-\n   related statements from the
    various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use\n   Cases, etc) into a single location
    Section 7.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
