abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a way of standardising the structure,\n
    \  language, and grammar used in security policies.  The goal is to\n   reduce
    ambiguity and confusion that stems from poorly-worded security\n   policies.  Organisations
    and individuals can refer back to this\n   document if their security policy uses
    definitions found in this\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
