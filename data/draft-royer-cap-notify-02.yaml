abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo describes a method used to ask for and receivenotifications.
    These notifications will be the direct result of astored components and the notifications
    or changes to components orthe store and are represented in iCalendar format.
    This is anextensions to iCalendar objects.This memo has been updated to include
    non-CAP notificaitons.This memo includes a new CAP command types of 'REQUEST-NOTIFY','NOTIFICATION',
    and 'CANCEL-NOTIFY', a new property of 'OBSERVER', anew iCalendar component 'NOTIFICATION',
    CAP capabilities of'CAN-NOTIFY', 'NOTIFY-UPDATES', and 'ALLOW-NOTIFY-BOT'. A'REQUEST-NOTIFY'
    command is a request to add an observer to ancomponent in the 'TARGET' calendar.
    In addition the 'REQUEST-NOTIFY'command can alert the CUA of changes to specific
    components or in thecalendar or calendar store. Everything is subject to VCARrestrictions.These
    are asynchronous notifications must be advertised by the CS andrequested by the
    CUA. This memo discusses how to transport theseiCalendar objects and using them
    with CAP.In addition if the CS and CUA support the 'NOTIFY-UPDATES'capability,
    then the CS will send 'NOTIFICATION' components to theCUA describing the UIDs
    or TARGETS that have changed since thecurrently authenticated CU was last connected
    allowing for easiersynchronization.</p>"
