abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Host based IPv6 mobility is specified in Mobile IPv6 base\n
    \  specification [RFC3775].  In that model, the mobile node is\n   responsible
    for doing the signaling to its home agent to enable\n   session continuity as
    it moves between subnets.  The design principle\n   in the case of host-based
    mobility relies on the mobile node being in\n   control of the mobility management.
    \ Network based mobility allows IP\n   session continuity for a mobile node without
    its involvement in\n   mobility management.  This specification describes a protocol\n
    \  solution for network based mobility management that relies on Mobile\n   IPv6
    signaling and reuse of home agent functionality.  A proxy\n   mobility agent in
    the network which manages the mobility for a mobile\n   node is the reason for
    referring to this protocol as Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
