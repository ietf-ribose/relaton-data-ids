abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Open Ethics Transparency Protocol (OETP) is an application-level\n
    \  protocol for publishing and accessing ethical Disclosures of IT\n   Products
    and their Components.  The Protocol is based on HTTP\n   exchange of information
    about the ethical \"postures\", provided in an\n   open and standardized format.
    \ The scope of the Protocol covers\n   Disclosures for systems such as Software
    as a Service (SaaS)\n   Applications, Software Applications, Software Components,
    Application\n   Programming Interfaces (API), Automated Decision-Making (ADM)\n
    \  systems, and systems using Artificial Intelligence (AI).  OETP aims\n   to
    bring more transparent, predictable, and safe environments for the\n   end-users.
    \ The OETP Disclosure Format is an extensible JSON-based\n   format.\n\n\t </p>\n
