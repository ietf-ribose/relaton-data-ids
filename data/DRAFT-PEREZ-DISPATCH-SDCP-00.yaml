abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia\n
    \  streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed\n   to
    improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things\n   streams.
    \ Usually, real time applications such as virtual reality\n   generate a user-controlled
    multimedia streaming.  This is a time\n   continuous data flux that could be divided
    spatially or temporally to\n   distribute processing, memory or network resources.
    \ This protocol\n   does not describe streaming communication, but the control
    of each\n   single streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes or things.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
