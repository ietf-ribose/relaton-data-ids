abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) is an advanced version
    of \n shortest path algorithms used in OSPF and IS-IS route computations.\n It
    is used in computing shortest path for label-switched paths \n (LSPs) based upon
    multiple constraints. While computing path for \n LSPs it considers topology of
    network, attributes of LSP and links.\n The path is computed using traffic engineering
    database which takes\n  \n the extensions of OSPF(open shortest path first) and
    IS-IS \n (Intermediate system to Intermediate system) as input.\n\n\nManayya KB\n\n
