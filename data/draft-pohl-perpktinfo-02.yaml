abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information Export
    (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing per-packet information
    by means of IPFIX. The main idea is to export two types of records per flow: one
    type that consists of the usual flow information plus a unique flow identifier;
    and a second type of record that consists of the actual per-packet information
    plus a flow identifier that refers to the flow the specific packet belongs to
    -- that means the flow identifier is used to associate the packet data to its
    corresponding flow.</p>"
