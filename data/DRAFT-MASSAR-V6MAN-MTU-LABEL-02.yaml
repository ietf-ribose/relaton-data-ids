abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document redefines the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field
    to allow\n   specification of the lowest MTU on a path that the packet travels,\n
    \  thus in most cases avoiding the need for performing Path MTU\n   Discovery
    and the round-trip penalty that that occurs for processing\n   the ICMPv6 PTB
    and retransmitting the packets involved.\n\n   This specification allows graceful
    decrease of MTU so that large and\n   non-standard MTU sizes can safely be used
    on the Internet.\n\n   [[A1: Obsoleting the IPv6 Flow Label and replacing it completely
    with\n   this field might be a better option than keeping it defined as an\n   IPv6
    Flow Label field and allowing existing flows to exist.  --JM]]\n   [[A2: A better
    name than \"IPv6 MTU Label\" is requested as it is not\n   really a \"Label\".
    \ --JM]]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
