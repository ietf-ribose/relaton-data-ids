abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the approach to validate the content
    of the\n   RPKI certificate tree, as used by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator.  This\n
    \  approach is independent of a particular object retrieval mechanism.\n   This
    allows it to be used with repositories available over the rsync\n   protocol,
    the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol, and repositories that\n   use a mix of both.\n\n
    \  This algorithm does not rely on content of repository directories,\n   but
    uses the Authority Key Identifier (AKI) field of a manifest and a\n   certificate
    revocation list (CRL) objects to discover manifest and\n   CRL objects issued
    by a particular Certificate Authority (CA).  It\n   further uses the hashes of
    manifest entries to discover other objects\n   issued by the CA.\n\n\t </p>\n
