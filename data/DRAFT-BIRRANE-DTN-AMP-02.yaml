abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol
    (AMP)\n   conformant with an Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA).  The\n
    \  AMP provides monitoring and configuration services between managing\n   devices
    (Managers) and managed devices (Agents), some of which may\n   operate on the
    far side of high-delay or high-disruption links.  The\n   AMP minimizes the number
    of transmitted bytes, operates without\n   sessions or (concurrent) two-way links,
    and functions autonomously\n   when there is no timely contact with a network
    operator.  The AMP\n   accomplishes this without requiring mobile code and generally
    reduces\n   the processor, memory, and storage requirements of implementing\n
    \  Managers and Agents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
