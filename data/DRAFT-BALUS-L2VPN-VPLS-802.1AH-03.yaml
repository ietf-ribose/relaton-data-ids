abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider
    \n   Backbone Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols \n   for
    interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB \n   was defined
    in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on \n   multipoint VLAN tunnels.
    MSTP is used as the core control plane for \n   loop avoidance and load balancing.
    As a result, the coverage of the \n   solution is limited by STP scale in the
    core of large service \n   provider networks.   \n\n   Virtual Private LAN Service
    (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution for \n   extending Ethernet LAN services,
    using MPLS tunneling capabilities, \n   through a routed MPLS backbone without
    running (M)STP across the \n   backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on
    a large scale in \n   service provider networks.  \n\n   This draft discusses
    extensions to the VPLS model required to \n   incorporate desirable PBB components
    while maintaining the Service \n   Provider fit of the initial model.\n\t </p>\n
