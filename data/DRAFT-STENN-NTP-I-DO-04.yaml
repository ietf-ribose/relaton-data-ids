abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The first implementation of NTPv4 was released in 2003.  NTPv4
    is\n   defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  It contains a public-key security\n   protocol,
    Autokey, which is defined by RFC 5906 [RFC5906].  Until\n   very recently, Autokey
    has been the only defined \"user\" of NTP packet\n   Extension Fields.  New proposals
    for extension fields are being\n   written and there is currently no convenient
    way to learn if a remote\n   instance of NTP supports any extension fields or
    not.  This proposal\n   contains a method to tell a remote instance of NTP what
    we (are\n   willing to admit we) support, and ask what they (are willing to admit\n
    \  they) support.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
