abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes \"Trickle ICE\", an extension to the\n
    \  Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that enables\n   ICE
    agents to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than\n   exchanging
    complete lists.  With such incremental provisioning, ICE\n   agents can begin
    connectivity checks while they are still gathering\n   candidates and considerably
    shorten the time necessary for ICE\n   processing to complete.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
