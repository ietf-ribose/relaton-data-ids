abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to transmit IPv6 packets on IEEE 802.11p networks there is
    a need to define a few parameters such as the recommended Maximum Transmission
    Unit size, the header format preceding the IPv6 base header, the Type value within
    it, and others. This document describes these parameters for IPv6 and IEEE 802.11p
    networks; it portrays the layering of IPv6 on 802.11p similarly to other known
    802.11 and Ethernet layers, by using an existing Ethernet Adaptation Layer. In
    addition, the document attempts to list what is different in 802.11p compared
    to more 'traditional' 802.11a/b/g/n layers, layers over which IPv6 protocols run
    ok. Most notably, the operation outside the context of a BSS (OCB) has impact
    on IPv6 handover behaviour and on IPv6 security. An example of an IPv6 packet
    captured while transmitted over an IEEE 802.11p link is given.</p>"
