abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP)\ncost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, \"the\nroute
    reflection approach may not yield the same route selection\nresult as that of
    the full IBGP mesh approach.\"  One practical\nimplication of this assertion is
    that the deployment of route\nreflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot
    potato routing.  Hot\npotato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest
    AS egress\npoint in cases where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.\nAs
    a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of exit\npoint for a
    route reflector and its clients will be the egress point\nclosest to the route
    reflector - and not necessarily closest to the\nRR clients.\n\nSection 11 of [RFC4456]
    describes a deployment approach and a set of\nconstraints which, if satsified,
    would result in the deployment of\nroute reflection yielding the same results
    as the iBGP full mesh\napproach.  Such a deployment approach would make route
    reflection\ncompatible with the application of hot potato routing policy.\n\nAs
    networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of new\nservices, tunneled
    (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized route\nreflectors became commonplace.
    \ This is one type of common deployment\nwhere it would be impractical to satisfy
    the constraints described in\nSection 11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment,
    hot potato\nrouting policy remains desirable.\n\nThis document proposes two new
    solutions which can be deployed to\nfacilitate the application of closest exit
    point policy centralized\nroute reflection deployments.\n\t </p>\n      "
