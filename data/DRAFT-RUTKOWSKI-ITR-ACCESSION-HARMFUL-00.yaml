abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the treaties maintained by the International Telecommunication\n
    \  Union is the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), whose\n   purpose
    historically has been to create international service\n   uniformity and a global
    monopoly cartel for provisioning legacy\n   international telecommunication services.
    Nations such as the U.S.\n   and Canada have typically neither signed them nor
    accepted their\n   provisions. The 1988 version of the ITRs was similar in purpose
    and\n   effect, but failed in its objectives because the mandated OSI\n   services
    and ITU-T standards were unsuccessful in the marketplace. In\n   addition, most
    of the world's Nation-States moved away from monopoly\n   government-run telecom
    provisioning to competitive market models.\n   This also resulted in a substantial
    decline of the ITU itself as an\n   intergovernmental home for monopoly Nation-State
    providers.\n\n   Given this institutional decline and the vestigial opposition
    of some\n   ITU Members to this provisioning paradigm shift, efforts were begun
    a\n   decade ago by some ITU participants and officials to imbue the ITU\n   with
    a vast expansion of its scope and jurisdiction and impose new\n   regulatory controls
    through revisions to the moribund ITRs. Most\n   progressive national Administrations
    opposed these efforts. The\n   conflict played out in Dec 2012 in Dubai at a global
    treaty conference\n   known as the WCIT.\n\n   Only 89 of the ITU 193 member nations
    signed the resulting treaty\n   instrument at Dubai - largely those without significant
    national\n   communication infrastructure, or those favoring strong regulatory\n
    \  regimes for Internet use. The result was an embarrassing\n   miscalculation
    for those seeking these changes. It bifurcated the\n   treaty basis for the ITU.
    This document analyses the many adverse\n   effects of the resulting treaty, and
    identifies problems that may\n   arise for those states acceding to the treaty.
    It concludes by noting\n   how the Internet community, including citizens of non-signatory\n
    \  countries, benefit from the rejection of this broken treaty\n   instrument.\n\n\t
