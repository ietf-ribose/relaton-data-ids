abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document intends to find out the size of an IP packet
    at which\n   VoIP applications will produce the best result. It emphasizes the\n
    \  physical phenomenon because of which ATM networks perform better than\n   the
    IP switch based networks and tries to come out with an approach\n   by which IP
    switch based network can perform as good as ATM network\n   for the processing
    of real time traffic.\n\t </p>\n      "
