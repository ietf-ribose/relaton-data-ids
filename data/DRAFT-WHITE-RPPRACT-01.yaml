abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses common practices used in deploying routing\nprotocols
    in both public and private networks.  The focus is not to\ndescribe how routing
    protocols should be deployed, but rather how\nthey are generally deployed, to
    provide those working on\nspecifications which impact the operation of routing
    protocols with\nguidance in what will likely be deployed, or what will likely
    not be\ndeployed.  The focus in thie document will be ionterdomain routing,\nbut
    it will cover aspects of intradomain routing, as well.1.  Background\n\nWhen considering
    new extensions to existing routing protocols, it's\nuseful to consider them in
    the context of existing usage of these\nprotocols.  Various questions come to
    mind, such as:\n\no  Common Underlying Principles of Network Designs\no  Common
    Practices in Route Origination\no  Common Practices in Routing Database Management\no
    \ Common Practices in Aggregation\no  Common Practices in Peering\no  Common Practices
    in Security\no  ....\n\nEach of these topics will be covered in a separate section
    below.\n\t </p>\n      "
