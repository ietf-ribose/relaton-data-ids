abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Link hints are going to be standardized to enhance interactions
    \nbetween link and network layers, allowing a given node to integrate \nand efficiently
    manage one or even several network interfaces.  \nParameters conveyed in Link
    Hints shall provide the necessary \nabstraction level to be mapped on several
    technologies.  This \ndocument provides a first list of parameters to be transported
    in \nLink Hints but the way to transport them is out of the scope of  \nthis document.
    \nTwo sets of parameters are proposed: the MN set gathers information \navailable
    at the Mobile Node whereas the AR set is relevant for the \nAccess Router side.
    In each set, parameters are grouped into three \ndistinct categories: static parameters
    are related to the hardware \nimplementation of the interface, configuration parameters
    are \nmanageable through interface configuration, status parameters are \nhighly
    varying as they provide the current link environment of the \ninterface. \n\t
