abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo specifies multicast component for MAP-E and Light
    Weight\n   4over6 so that IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4\n   servers
    over an IPv6 network.  Two types of solutions are developed,\n   encapsulation
    and translation.  In the encapsulation solution for\n   MAP-E and lw4o6, IGMP
    Proxy at the MAP-E Customer Edge router/lwB4\n   uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to exchange
    IGMP messages to establish\n   multicast state at MAP-E Border Relay/lwAFTR so
    that MAP-E Border\n   Relay/lwAFTR can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts.
    \ In the\n   Translation Multicast solution for MAP-T, 4rd and lw4o6, IGMP\n   messages
    are translated into MLD messages and sent to the network in\n   IPv6.  MAP-T/4rd
    Border Relay/lwAFTR does the reverse translation and\n   joins IPv4 multicast
    group for the hosts.  Border Relay/lwAFTR as\n   multicast router receives IPv4
    multicast data and translates the\n   packet into IPv6 multicast data and sends
    downstream on the multicast\n   tree.  Member CEs/lwB4s receive multicast data,
    translate it back to\n   IPv4 and transmit to the hosts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
