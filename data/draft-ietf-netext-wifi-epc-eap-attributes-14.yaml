abstract:
- content: "<p>With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service
    providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in
    3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access
    Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and
    seamless mobility between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks. The EAP-AKA (and EAP-AKA')
    protocol is required for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core
    (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks. This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable
    the above- mentioned functions in such networks. The attributes are exchanged
    between a client (such as a Mobile Node) and its network counterpart (such as
    a AAA server) in the service provider's infrastructure.</p>"
