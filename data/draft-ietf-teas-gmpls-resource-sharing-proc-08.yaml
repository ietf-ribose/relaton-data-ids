abstract:
- content: "<p>In non-packet transport networks, there are requirements where the
    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs
    to employ a restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for
    the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs.
    This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource
    Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context
    of a GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed
    LSP is not torn down. In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based
    setup and teardown of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures. No new signaling
    extensions are defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</p>"
