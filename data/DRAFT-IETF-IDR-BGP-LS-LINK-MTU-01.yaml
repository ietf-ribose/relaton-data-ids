abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP Link State (BGP-LS) describes a mechanism by which link-state
    and\n   TE information can be collected from networks and shared with\n   external
    components using the BGP routing protocol.  The centralized\n   controller (PCE/SDN)
    completes the service path calculation based on\n   the information transmitted
    by the BGP-LS and delivers the result to\n   the Path Computation Client (PCC)
    through the PCEP or BGP protocol.\n\n   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source
    routing paradigm, which can\n   be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with
    no change on the\n   forwarding plane and applied to the IPv6 architecture, with
    a new\n   type of routing header, called SRH.  The SR uses the IGP protocol as\n
    \  the control protocol.  Compared to the MPLS tunneling technology, the\n   SR
    does not require additional signaling.  Therefore, the SR does not\n   support
    the negotiation of the Path MTU.  Since multiple labels or\n   SRv6 SIDs are pushed
    in the packets, it is more likely that the\n   packet size exceeds the path mtu
    of SR tunnel.\n\n   This document specifies the extensions to BGP Link State (BGP-LS)
    to\n   carry maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages of link.  The PCE/SDN\n
    \  calculates the Path MTU while completing the service path calculation\n   based
    on the information transmitted by the BGP-LS.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
