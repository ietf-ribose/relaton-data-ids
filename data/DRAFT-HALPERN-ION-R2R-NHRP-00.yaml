abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [1] specifies
    a\n   mechanism that allows a source station (e.g., a host or a router) on\n   an
    NBMA subnetwork to find the NBMA subnetwork address address of a\n   destination
    station when the destination station is connected to the\n   NBMA subnetwork.
    For the case where the destination station is off\n   the NBMA subnetwork the
    mechanism described in [1] allows to\n   determine the NBMA subnetwork address
    of an egress router from the\n   NBMA subnetwork that is ``nearest'' to the destination
    station.  If\n   used to locate an egress router wherein the destination station
    is\n   directly behind the egress router, the currently document NHRP\n   behaviors
    are sufficient.  However, as documented elsewhere [2],\n   there are cases where
    if used between routers for generalized\n   transit, NHRP can produce loops.\n
    \n   This document describes extensions to the NBMA Next Hop Resolution\n   Protocol
    (NHRP) [1] that allow to acquire and maintain the\n   information about the egress
    router without constraining the\n   destination(s) to be directly connected to
    the egress router.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
