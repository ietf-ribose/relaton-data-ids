abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a mechanism to set up a Local Security\nAssociation
    (LSA) between a user and the visited network when the\nuser is roaming. It defines
    all the required related functionalities\nsuch as the key generation, distribution
    and update procedures; it\nalso describes the reasons and the benefits of the
    adoption of such\nLSA. The applicability of this draft is mainly for AAA Diameter
    and\nfor URP (User Registration Protocol), but the mechanism can be\nadopted more
    in general in each case where the user (or mobile node)\nneeds to establish a
    security association with a foreign domain while\nroaming.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
