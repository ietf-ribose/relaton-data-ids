abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At one time, the RFC Editor published periodic snapshots of
    the\n   \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\".  These documents were known\n
    \  as xx00 documents, the most of which was published in May 2008.  This\n   document
    notes that the RFC Editor will no longer be publishing these\n   snapshots as
    RFCs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
