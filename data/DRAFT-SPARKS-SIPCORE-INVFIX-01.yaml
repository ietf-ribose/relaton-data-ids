abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP), to address an error in the specified handling of\nsuccess (200 class) responses
    to INVITE requests.  Elements following\nRFC 3261 exactly will misidentify retransmissions
    of the request as a\nnew, unassociated, request.  The correction involves modifying
    the\nINVITE transaction state machines.  The correction also changes the\nway
    responses that cannot be matched to an existing transaction are\nhandled to address
    a security risk.\n\t </p>\n      "
