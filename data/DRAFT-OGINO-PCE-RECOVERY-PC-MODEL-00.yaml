abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a PC model, where the recovery LSP route
    in a \n   domain is computed using an external PCE. Recovery LSP computation \n
    \  that promotes bandwidth sharing between other recovery LSPs requires \n   unreserved
    bandwidth information that corresponds to each failure \n   position or SRLG.
    However, the present IGP-TE can only advertise \n   unreserved bandwidth information
    corresponding to eight priority \n   classes to each LSR involved in an IGP area.
    An external PCE in a \n   domain can compute efficient recovery LSP routes by
    exclusively \n   preserving such unreserved bandwidth information without any
    \n   extension of the present IGP-TE. \n\t </p>\n      "
