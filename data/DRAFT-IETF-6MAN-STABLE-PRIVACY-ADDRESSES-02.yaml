abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface\n
    \  Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n   (SLAAC),
    such that addresses configured using this method are stable\n   within each subnet,
    but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts\n   move from one network to another.
    \ The aforementioned method is meant\n   to be an alternative to generating Interface
    Identifiers based on\n   IEEE identifiers, such that the benefits of stable addresses
    can be\n   achieved without sacrificing the privacy of users.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
