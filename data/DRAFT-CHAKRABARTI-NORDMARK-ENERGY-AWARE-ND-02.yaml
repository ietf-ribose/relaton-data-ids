abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed
    for\n   neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address\n   autoconfiguration,
    router advertisement and solicitation.  With the\n   progress of Internet adoption
    on various industries including home,\n   wireless and machine-to-machine communications,
    there is a desire for\n   optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol to
    be more\n   efficient in terms of number of signaling messages in the network.\n
    \  Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is useful for energy-efficient\n   networks
    and as well for overlay networks such as VLANs with large\n   number of nodes.
    \ This document describes a method of optimizations\n   by reducing periodic multicast
    messages, frequent Neighbor\n   Solicitation messages and discusses interoperability
    with legacy IPv6\n   nodes.  It also addresses the ND denial of service issues
    by\n   introducing node Registration procedure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
