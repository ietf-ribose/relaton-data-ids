abstract:
- content: <p>BGP [RFC4271] has been used to distribute different types of routing
    and policy information in the network. In some cases, the information distributed
    may be only intended for one or several particular receiving BGP nodes in the
    network. However, BGP does not have a general mechanism of designating the receiving
    node of the routing information. This document defines a new type of BGP Extended
    Community called "Node Target". The mechanism of using the Node Target Extended
    Community to steer BGP route distribution to particular BGP nodes is specified.</p>
