abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the procedure of data packet triggered\n
    \  binding creation, which is suitable for DHCP assigned addresses,\n   stateless
    addresses and manually configured addresses. This procedure\n   can help minimize
    loss of legitimate packets as well as prevent the\n   use of forged or spoofed
    addresses.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
