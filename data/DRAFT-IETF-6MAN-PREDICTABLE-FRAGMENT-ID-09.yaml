abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the\n
    \  fragmentation and reassembly mechanisms.  The Fragment Header\n   contains
    an \"Identification\" field which, together with the IPv6\n   Source Address and
    the IPv6 Destination Address of a packet,\n   identifies fragments that correspond
    to the same original datagram,\n   such that they can be reassembled together
    by the receiving host.\n   The only requirement for setting the \"Identification\"
    field is that\n   the corresponding value must be different than that employed
    for any\n   other fragmented packet sent recently with the same Source Address\n
    \  and Destination Address.  Some implementations use a simple global\n   counter
    for setting the Identification field, thus leading to\n   predictable Identification
    values.  This document analyzes the\n   security implications of predictable Identification
    values, and\n   provides implementation guidance for selecting the Identification\n
    \  field of the Fragment Header, such that the aforementioned security\n   implications
    are mitigated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
