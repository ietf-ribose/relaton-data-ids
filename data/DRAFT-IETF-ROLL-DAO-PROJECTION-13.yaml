abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC 6550 to enable a RPL Root to install
    and\n   maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of\n
    \  nodes that may or may not include self, for a chosen duration.  This\n   potentially
    enables routes that are more optimized or resilient than\n   those obtained with
    the classical distributed operation of RPL,\n   either in terms of the size of
    a source-route header or in terms of\n   path length, which impacts both the latency
    and the packet delivery\n   ratio.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
