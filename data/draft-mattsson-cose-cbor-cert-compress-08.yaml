abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates. The
    resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates. The CBOR encoding supports
    a large subset of RFC 5280 and significantly reduces the size of certificates
    compatible with e.g. RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, and CA/Browser Forum
    Baseline Requirements. When used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates,
    the CBOR encoding can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates
    with over 50%. The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be signed directly
    ("natively signed"), which does not require re-encoding for the signature to be
    verified. The document also specifies COSE headers as well as a TLS certificate
    type for C509 certificates. NOTE: "C509" is a placeholder, name to be decided
    by the COSE WG.</p>'
