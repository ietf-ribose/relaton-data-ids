abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling
    (DOTS) signal channel Call Home, which enables a Call Home DOTS server to initiate
    a secure connection to a Call Home DOTS client and to receive attack traffic information
    from the Call Home DOTS client. The Call Home DOTS server in turn uses the attack
    traffic information to identify compromised devices launching outgoing DDoS attacks
    and take appropriate mitigation action(s). The DOTS signal channel Call Home is
    not specific to home networks; the solution targets any deployment in which it
    is required to block DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.</p>"
