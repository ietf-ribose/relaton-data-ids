abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes the Intra-Network eXposure analyzer
    Utility\n   (INXU) as a vulnerability management solution for IoT networks.  The\n
    \  goal of INXU is to extend the functions of the RFC 8520 and support a\n   Security
    Experts Team on protecting multiple heterogeneous IoT\n   networks, even when
    there is a few or none private information of the\n   networks.\n\n   INXU identifies
    and analyzes the capability of an IoT device being\n   exploited by an well known
    malicious activity.  We also propose the\n   Malicious Traffic Description (MTD),
    a data-model to describe traffic\n   related to malicious activities.\n\n\t </p>\n
