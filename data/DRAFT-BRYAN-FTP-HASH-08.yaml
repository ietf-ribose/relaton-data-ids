abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify
    the\nintegrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared\nagainst each
    other without actually transferring them first.\nCryptographic hashes are a possible
    solution to this problem.  In the\npast, several attempts have been made to add
    commands to obtain\nchecksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,\nleading
    to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these\nissues, this document
    specifies a new FTP command to be used by\nclients to request cryptographic hashes
    of files.\n\t </p>\n      "
