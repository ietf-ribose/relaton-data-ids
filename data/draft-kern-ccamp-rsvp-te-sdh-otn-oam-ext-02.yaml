abstract:
  content: <p>GMPLS has been extended to support connection establishment in bothSONET/SDH
    [RFC4606] and OTN [RFC4328] networks. However support forthe configuration of
    the supervision functions is not specified.Both SONET/SDH and OTN implement supervision
    functions to qualify thetransported signals. This document defines extensions
    to RSVP-TE forSONET/SDH and OTN OAM configuration based on the OAM ConfigurationFramework
    defined in [GMPLS-OAM-FWK].Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
    [RFC2119].</p>
