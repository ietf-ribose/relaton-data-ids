abstract:
- content: "<p>Designing an efficient source address validation (SAV) filter requires
    minimizing false positives (i.e., avoiding dropping legitimate traffic) while
    maintaining directionality (see RFC8704). This document advances the technology
    for SAV filter design through a method that makes use of BGP UPDATE messages,
    Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA), and Route Origin Authorization
    (ROA). The proposed method's name is abbreviated as BAR-SAV. BAR-SAV can be used
    by network operators to derive more robust SAV filters and thus improve network
    resilience.</p>"
