abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF regularly develops new technologies.  Sometimes there
    are\n   several standards that can be combined to become vastly more than the\n
    \  sum of their parts.  Right now, there are six technologies either\n   recently
    adopted or poised for adoption that create such a cluster.\n   Combining secure
    onboarding, remote attestation, secure update,\n   software bill-of-materials/expected
    attestation, automated network\n   policy enforcement, and trusted execution environment
    provisioning,\n   devices can be defended from many threats.  This is an opportunity\n
    \  for an inflection point for more secure and trustworthy devices.\n   Simultaneous
    adoption of two or more of these six standards could\n   create the foundation
    of computing devices that are worth trusting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
