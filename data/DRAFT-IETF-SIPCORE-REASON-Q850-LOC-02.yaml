abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The SIP Reason header field is defined for carrying ISUP cause
    values\n   as well as SIP response codes.  Some services in SIP networks may\n
    \  need to know the ISUP location where the call was released in the\n   PSTN
    network to correctly interpret the reason of release.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
