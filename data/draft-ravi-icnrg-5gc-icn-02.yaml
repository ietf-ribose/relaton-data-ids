abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers flexibility
    to introduce new user and control plane function, considering the support for
    network slicing functions, that allows greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous
    devices and applications. In this draft, we provide a short description of the
    proposed 5GC architecture, followed by extensions to 5GC's control and user plane
    to support packet data unit (PDU) sessions from information-centric networks.
    The value of enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed using multiple service scenarios
    in the context of mobile edge computing such as smart mobility and VR use case,
    and to enable network services such as seamless mobility for ICN sessions.</p>"
