abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and\n   transmitted
    using UDP or DTLS as transports.  These transports are\n   optimal solutions for
    CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments\n   and nodes.  However compelling
    motivation exists for allowing CoAP to\n   operate with other transports and protocols.
    \ Examples are M2M\n   communication in cellular networks using SMS, more suitable
    transport\n   protocols for firewall/NAT traversal, end-to-end reliability and\n
    \  security such as TCP and TLS, or employing proxying and tunneling\n   gateway
    techniques such as the WebSocket protocol.  This draft\n   examines the requirements
    for conveying CoAP messages to end points\n   over such alternative transports.
    \ It also provides a new URI format\n   for representing CoAP resources over alternative
    transports.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
