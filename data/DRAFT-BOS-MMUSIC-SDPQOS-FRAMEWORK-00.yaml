abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a framework to negotiate end-to-end the
    \n'Quality' of a multimedia session 'as the end-user to perceive \nit'. This UPQoS
    (User Perceived QoS) negotiation is achieved at \nsession signaling level using
    two types of new SDP extensions, which \nthis document proposes to specify. All
    session control elements - \nuser agents as well as proxies - involved in the
    multimedia session \nsetup may participate to the UPQoS negotiation\n\t </p>\n
