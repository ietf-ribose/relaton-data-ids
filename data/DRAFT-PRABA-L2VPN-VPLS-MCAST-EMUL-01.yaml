abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide
    a \n   logical interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific \n   VPLS
    instance appear to be connected by a single LAN.  A VPLS \n   solution performs
    replication for multicast traffic at the ingress \n   PE devices.  When replicated
    at the ingress PE, multicast traffic \n   wastes bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic
    is sent to sites with no \n   members, and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites
    go through a shared \n   path. This document addresses the above cases by using
    LDP \n   signaling to emulate Multicast operation over VPLS with out using \n
    \  IGMP and PIM snooping as described in [VPLS-MCAST].\n\t </p>\n      "
