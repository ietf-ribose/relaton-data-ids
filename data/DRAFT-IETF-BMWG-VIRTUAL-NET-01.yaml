abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted\n
    \  laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of\n   internetworking
    functions.  This memo investigates additional\n   considerations when network
    functions are virtualized and performed\n   in commodity off-the-shelf hardware.\n\n
    \  Version NOTES:\n\n   Addressed Ramki Krishnan's comments on section 4.5, power,
    see that\n   section (7/27 message to the list).  Addressed Saurabh\n   Chattopadhyay's
    7/24 comments on VNF resources and other resource\n   conditions and their effect
    on benchmarking, see section 3.4.\n   Addressed Marius Georgescu's 7/17 comments
    on the list (sections 4.3\n   and 4.4).\n\n   AND, comments from the extended
    discussion during IETF-93 BMWG\n   session:\n\n   Section 4.2: VNF footprint and
    auxilliary metrics (Maryam Tahhan),\n   Section 4.3: Verification affect metrics
    (Ramki Krishnan);\n   Section 4.4: Auxilliary metrics in the Matrix (Maryam Tahhan,
    Scott\n   Bradner, others)\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
