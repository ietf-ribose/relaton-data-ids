abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the  Multicast Synchronisation (MSYNC)\n
    \  Protocol that aims at transferring video media objects over IP\n   multicast
    operating preferably RTP. Although generic, MSYNC has been\n   primarily designed
    for transporting HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS)\n   objects including manifest/playlists
    and media segments (e.g. MP4,\n   CMAF) according to an HAS protocol such as Apple
    HLS or MPEG DASH\n   between a multicast server and a multicast gateway.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
