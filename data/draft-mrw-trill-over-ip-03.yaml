abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is
    implemented by devices called TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges). TRILL
    supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a
    variety of link protocols can be used between TRILL switch ports. This document
    standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in IP(v4 or v6) to provide a unified
    TRILL campus.</p>"
