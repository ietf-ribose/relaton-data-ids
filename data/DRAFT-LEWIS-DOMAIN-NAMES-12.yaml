abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or
    does the\n   DNS protocol exist to support the concept of Domain Names?  This\n
    \  question has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain\n   Names
    in protocols in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the\n   operational
    environment built to run the protocol.  To help answer\n   this question, a look
    into the recorded history of Requests for\n   Comments is presented.\n\n\t </p>\n
