abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a set of strategies to allow clients
    to\n   submit new email messages incorporating content which resides on\n   locations
    external to the client.  This is the so-called 'IMAP\n   Pull' approach currently
    being considered by the LEMONADE working\n   group as one solution to the 'forward
    without download' problem\n   (that is, as a means for clients to send new messages
    consisting of\n   or containing all or parts of previously received messages without\n
    \  having to download and upload the data).  Some of the strategies\n   in this
    document rely upon extensions to other protocols;\n   specifically URLAUTH and
    CATENATE in the IMAP protocol (RFC 3501)\n   and BURL in the SUBMIT protocol (RFC
    2476).\n\t </p>\n      "
