abstract:
  content: "<p>This document provides a functional description of the services providedby
    the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) asdescribed in ITU Recommendation
    Q.2110. SSCOP performs connectioncontrol, transfer of variable length user data
    units, sequenceintegrity, error correction, and flow control functions to its
    users.These services are currently used to support the transport requirementsof
    signalling applications which require reliable, ordered, low-latencytransfer over
    large bandwidth paths. Although SSCOP is currentlydefined to transfer information
    between Layer 3 entities across theUNI and NNI using ATM virtual channels it may
    be possible to apply thesame concepts to provide transfer of information over
    UDP/IP.</p>"
