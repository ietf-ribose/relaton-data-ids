abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a functional description of the services provided
    by the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) as described in ITU
    Recommendation Q.2110. SSCOP performs connection control, transfer of variable
    length user data units, sequence integrity, error correction, and flow control
    functions to its users. These services are currently used to support the transport
    requirements of signalling applications which require reliable, ordered, low-latency
    transfer over large bandwidth paths. Although SSCOP is currently defined to transfer
    information between Layer 3 entities across the UNI and NNI using ATM virtual
    channels it may be possible to apply the same concepts to provide transfer of
    information over UDP/IP.</p>"
