abstract:
  content: "<p>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control planefrom
    undesired or malicious traffic. In this approach, alllegitimate control plane
    traffic is identifed. Once legitimatetraffic has been identified, a filter is
    deployed on the router'sforwarding plane. That filter prevents traffic not specificallyidentified
    as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.</p>"
