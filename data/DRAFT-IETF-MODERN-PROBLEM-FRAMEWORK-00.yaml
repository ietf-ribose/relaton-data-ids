abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The functions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN)
    are\n   rapidly migrating to the Internet.  This is generating new\n   requirements
    for many traditional elements of the PSTN, including\n   telephone numbers (TNs).
    \ TNs no longer serve simply as telephone\n   routing addresses, they are now
    identifiers which may be used by\n   Internet-based services for a variety of
    purposes including session\n   establishment, identity verification, and service
    enablement.  This\n   problem statement examines how the existing tools for allocating
    and\n   managing telephone numbers do not align with the use cases of the\n   Internet
    environment, and proposes a framework for Internet-based\n   services relying
    on TNs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
