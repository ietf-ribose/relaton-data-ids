abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture
    defines\n   Conceptual Messages as input and output of the appraisal process that\n
    \  assesses the trustworthiness of remote peers: Evidence and\n   Attestation
    Results.  Based on the Trustworthiness Vectors defined in\n   Trusted Path Routing,
    this document defines a core set of Claims to\n   be used in Evidence and Attestation
    Results for the Software Update\n   for the Internet of Things (SUIT) Workflow
    Model.  Consecutively,\n   this document is in support of the Trusted Execution
    Environment\n   Provisioning (TEEP) architecture, which defines the assessment
    of\n   remote peers via RATS and uses SUIT for evidence generation as well\n   as
    a remediation measure to improve trustworthiness of given remote\n   peers.\n\n\t
