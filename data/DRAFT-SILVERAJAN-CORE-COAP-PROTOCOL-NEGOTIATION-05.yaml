abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based\n
    \  protocol.  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging\n   CoAP
    resource representations, this document introduces a way forward\n   for CoAP
    endpoints as well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate\n   transport and
    protocol configurations as well as URIs for CoAP\n   messaging, using the CoRE
    Resource Directory.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
