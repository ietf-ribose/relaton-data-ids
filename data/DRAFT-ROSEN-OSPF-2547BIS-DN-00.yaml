abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>[VPN] describes a method by which a Service Provider (SP) may
    provide\na VPN service to its customers.  In that method, BGP is used to carry\ncustomer
    routes across the SP's backbone.  That method allows a\nvariety of different protocols
    to be used as the routing protocol\nbetween the Customer Edge (CE) router and
    the Provider Edge (PE)\nrouter.  [VPN-OSPF] specifies additional procedures to
    be used when\nthe CE/PE router protocol is OSPF.  In these additional procedures,\ncustomer
    OSPF routes from a CE router are translated into BGP routes\nby a PE router.  Then
    they are sent via BGP to another PE router,\nwhich translates them back into OSPF
    routes and distributes them to\nanother CE router.  This translation may lose
    some of the information\nneeded to prevent loops.   This document proposes that
    one of the\nOSPF options bits be used to ensure that when a  VPN route is sent\nfrom
    a PE to a CE, the route will be ignored by any PE which receives\nit back from
    a CE.\n\t </p>\n      "
