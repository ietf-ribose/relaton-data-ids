abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   During the process of establishing peer-to-peer connectivity,
    ICE\n   agents can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to\n
    \  check, and, as a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed.\n   However,
    because additional candidate pairs can be discovered during\n   ICE processing,
    declaring failure at this point may be premature.\n   This document discusses
    when these situations can occur and proposes\n   a way to avoid premature failure.
    \ This document updates RFC 8445 and\n   RFC XXXX.\n\n   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please
    replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of\n   draft-ietf-ice-trickle once it has
    been published.  Please also\n   indicate that this specification updates RFC
    XXXX.]\n\n\t </p>\n      "
