abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written in the context of the Delay Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and will be presented for reviewing by that group. This document
    defines dLife, an opportunistic routing protocol that takes advantage of time-evolving
    social structures. dLife belongs to the family of social-aware opportunistic routing
    protocols for intermittently connected networks. dLife operates based on a representation
    of the dynamics of social structures as a weighted contact graph, where the weights
    (i.e., social strengths) express how long a pair of nodes is in contact over different
    period of times. It considers two complementary utility functions: Time-Evolving
    Contact Duration (TECD) that captures the evolution of social interaction among
    pairs of users in the same daily period of time, over consecutive days; and TECD
    Importance (TECDi) that captures the evolution of user's importance, based on
    its node degree and the social strength towards its neighbors, in different periods
    of time. It is intended for use in wireless networks where there is no guarantee
    that a fully connected path between any source - destination pair exists at any
    time, a scenario where traditional routing protocols are unable to deliver bundles.
    Such networks can be sparse mesh, in which case intermittent connectivity is due
    to lack of physical connections, or dense mesh, in which case intermittent connectivity
    may be due to high interference or shadowing. In any case, intermittent connectivity
    can also be due to the availability of devices (e.g., unavailable due to power
    saving rules). The document presents an architectural overview followed by the
    protocol specification.</p>"
