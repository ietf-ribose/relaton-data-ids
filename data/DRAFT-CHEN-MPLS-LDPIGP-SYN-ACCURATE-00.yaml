abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  A fundamental concept in Label Distribution Protocol - Interior
    \n  Gateway Protocol (LDP-IGP) Synchronization is that LDP is fully \n  established
    before the IGP path is switched for IP forwarding. This \n  document proposes
    a mechanism to affirm the switching time accurately \n  by propagating a explicit
    notification from downstream. The \n  interoperability with other Label Switched
    Routers (LSRs), which may \n  not support the mechanism, is also considered. \n\n\t
