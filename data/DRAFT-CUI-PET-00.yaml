abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>IPv6 offers significant advantages over IPv4, however it will
    take \n long time to replace IPv4 with IPv6. Therefore, these two protocols are
    \n expected to coexist during the transition period. Currently, there are \n many
    transition devices deployed to solve transition problems. Most of \n them only
    use one technology (either translation or tunneling). However,\n any transition
    technology has limitation and application scope. In \n transition scenarios, besides
    IP version of source, middle and destination\n network, the network characteristic
    (a regular edge network or a backbone) \n has key impact on system performance
    of transition methods. Therefore, we \n need to decide which transition method
    should be used in some typical \n transition scenarios and how the transition
    and tunneling devices \n collaborate for solving transition problems. This draft
    introduces a smart\n toolbox named PET (shortfor Prefixing, encapsulation and
    translation) which\n includes all fundamental elements needed in all transition
    scenarios, such\n as the control and data plane operations of tunneling and translation.\n
    Based on PET, we propose a network side transition solution. In this framework,
    \n there deploys only one kind of transition device, i.e. PET. Through the\n collaboration
    of PETs, the transition problems can be solved. In this draft, \n we give the
    advantages and disadvantages of all transition methods PET may adopt\n according
    to IP version of source, middle and destination network, and the \n network characteristic.
