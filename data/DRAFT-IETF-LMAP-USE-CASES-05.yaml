abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important
    for\n   network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public\n   policy.
    \ Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring\n   broadband performance
    is essential to development of the Large-scale\n   Measurement of Broadband Performance
    (LMAP) framework, information\n   model and protocol. This document details two
    use cases that can\n   assist to developing that framework.  The details of the
    measurement\n   metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\t
