abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in the state of resources.
    This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP Observe so that a CoAP client can
    conditionally observe a resource on a CoAP server, only being informed about state
    changes meeting a specific condition. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</p>"
