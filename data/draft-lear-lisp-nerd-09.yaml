abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a protocol to encapsulate
    IP packets in order to allow end sites to route to one another without injecting
    routes from one end of the Internet to another. This memo presents an experimental
    database and a discussion of methods to transport the mapping of Endpoint IDs
    (EIDs) to Routing Locators (RLOCs) to routers in a reliable, scalable, and secure
    manner. Our analysis concludes that transport of all EID-to- RLOC mappings scales
    well to at least 10^8 entries. This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>"
