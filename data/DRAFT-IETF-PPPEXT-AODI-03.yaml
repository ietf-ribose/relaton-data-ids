abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Always On/Dynamic ISDN (AO/DI) is a networking service that provides\nan
    always-available connection to TCP/IP-based services through a\nspecific wide
    area connection. This service provides several\nadvantages over current practices
    for dial-up access to Internet\nservices.\n* For the end-user, there is no need
    to dial-up the service each\ntime access is desired.\n* For the Internet service
    provider, it is possible to give the\nend-user a notification, such as the arrival
    of new mail.\n* For the Local Exchange Carrier, the switched circuit trunk\nutilization
    is more efficient.\n\t </p>\n      "
