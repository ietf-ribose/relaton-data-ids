    to the\n   question of whether support of sleepy devices is required for the\n
    \  CoAP protocol, CORE Link Format, CORE Resource Directory, etc.  The\n   only
    goal of this document is to trigger discussions in the CORE WG\n   so that all
    relevant considerations for sleeping devices are taken\n   into account.\n\n\t
