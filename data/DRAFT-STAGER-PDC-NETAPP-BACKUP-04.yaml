abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>      The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) is an open protocol\n
    \     for enterprise-wide network based backup. The NDMP architecture\n      allows
    network attached storage vendors  to ship NDMP compliant\n      file servers which
    can be used by any NDMP-compliant backup\n      administration application. This
    same architecture is also used\n      for network-attached backup devices, such
    as tape drives and\n      tape libraries.\n\t </p>\n      "
