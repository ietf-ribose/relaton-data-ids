abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) label was originally
    defined\n   to identify a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).  A packet is\n   assigned
    to a specific FEC based on its network layer destination\n   address, and optionally
    Class of Service.  It's difficult or even\n   impossible to derive the source
    identity information from the label.\n   For some applications, source identification
    is a critical\n   requirement.  For example, performance monitoring, where the\n
    \  monitoring node needs to identify where a packet was sent from.\n\n   This
    document introduces the concept of Source Identifier (SI) that\n   identifies
    the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR) of a Label\n   Switched Path (LSP).  A
    SI is unique within a domain that is referred\n   to as Source Identifier Administrative
    Domain (SIAD).\n\n   This document also introduces the concept of Source Label
    (SL) that\n   is carried in the label stack and carries the SI of the ingress
    LSR\n   of an LSP.  Source Label is preceded by a Source Label Indicator\n   (SLI)
    when included the label stack and is not used for forwarding.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
