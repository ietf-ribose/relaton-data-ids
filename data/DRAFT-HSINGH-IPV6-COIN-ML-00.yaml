abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine\n
    \  learning (ML) has been presented.  A network switch implementation\n   uses
    IPv4 broadcast messages from switch to the hosts to send updates\n   to all workers.
    \ IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses.  This\n   document proposes, IPv6
    implementations use the IPv6 link-local all-\n   nodes multicast address to receive
    messages from a switch, until a\n   new link-local multicast address is assigned
    by IANA for switch to\n   hosts multicast communications for switch machine learning\n
    \  algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
