abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) is a generic platform
    for\n   tenant applications (i.e.  AFs).  As we will see in some examplery\n   use
    cases, AFs may not only require communication capability\n   supported from the
    infrastructure side, but also the capability the\n   infrastructure can hold and
    re-distribute information on-demand.\n   This document proposes a set of solutions
    for information\n   distribution in the ANI.  Information distribution is categorized\n
    \  into two different modes: 1) instantaneous distribution and 2)\n   publishing
    for retrieval.  In the former case, the information is\n   sent, propagated and
    disposed of after reception.  In the latter\n   case, information needs to be
    stored in the network; additionally,\n   conflict resolution is also needed when
    information stored in the\n   network is updated with proposals from two different
    AFs.\n\n   The capability of information distribution is a fundamental need for\n
    \  an autonomous network ([RFC7575]).  This document describes typical\n   use
    cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI,\n   such that
    abundant ways of information distribution can be natively\n   supported.  This
    draft proposes a series of extensions to the\n   autonomic nodes and suggests
    an implementation based on GRASP\n   ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) extensions as a
    protocol on the wire.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
