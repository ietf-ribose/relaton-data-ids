abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers
    to use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers cannot be
    reached to refresh expired data. One of the motivations for serve-stale is to
    make the DNS more resilient to DoS attacks and thereby make them less attractive
    as an attack vector. This document updates the definitions of TTL from RFCs 1034
    and 1035 so that data can be kept in the cache beyond the TTL expiry; it also
    updates RFC 2181 by interpreting values with the high-order bit set as being positive,
    rather than 0, and suggests a cap of 7 days.</p>"
