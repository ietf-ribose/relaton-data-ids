abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers
    to\n   use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers\n   cannot
    be reached to refresh expired data.  It updates the definition\n   of TTL from
    [RFC1034], [RFC1035], and [RFC2181] to make it clear that\n   data can be kept
    in the cache beyond the TTL expiry and used for\n   responses when a refreshed
    answer is not readily available.  One of\n   the motivations for serve-stale is
    to make the DNS more resilient to\n   DoS attacks, and thereby make them less
    attractive as an attack\n   vector.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
