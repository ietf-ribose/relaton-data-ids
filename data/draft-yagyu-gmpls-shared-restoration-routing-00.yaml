abstract:
  content: "<p>Shared mesh restoration technique efficiently uses network resourcessince
    restoration capacity is shared across multiple independentfailures. In this scheme,
    when a new working LSP is established, itscorresponding backup LSP is pre-calculated
    and resources along therestoration route are reserved. The resources reserved
    on each linkalong the restoration path may be shared across different workingLSPs
    that are not expected to fail simultaneously. To make the methodfor selection
    of backup LSPs more efficient in terms of utilizationof network resources, each
    link should provide the route calculatorwith information about its restoration
    capacity and SRLGs of workingLSPs whose backup LSPs share the link restoration
    capacity. In thisdocument we propose extensions to OSPF-TE in support of carrying
    link'Sharable Bandwidth' information.</p>"
