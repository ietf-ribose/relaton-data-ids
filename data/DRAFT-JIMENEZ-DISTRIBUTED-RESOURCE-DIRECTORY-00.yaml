abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient to offer non-centralized\n
    \  alternatives for discovery and rendezvous.  This document defines a\n   Distributed
    Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained Application\n   Protocol (CoAP).  Distribution
    is achieved by means of a structured\n   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay.  The DHT-based
    P2P overlay provides\n   discovery, rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points
    as\n   well as HTTP proxy service for Web clients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
