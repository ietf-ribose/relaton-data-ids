abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When an ad hoc network is connected to the Internet, it is important
    \nfor the mobile nodes to detect available gateways providing access to \nthe
    Internet. Therefore, a gateway discovery and selection mechanism \nis required.
    Current ad hoc routing protocols have been extended to \nsupport gateway discovery.
    However, the selection process is based on \nthe default gateway configuration.
    We here describe an extension to \nMANET protocols to enable the gateway selection
    according to usersâ€™ \nrequirements, especially in the case where multiple gateways
    co-\nexist.   \n\t </p>\n      "
