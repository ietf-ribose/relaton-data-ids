abstract:
- content: "<p>Information Centric Networking has been proposed as a new network layer
    for the Internet, capable of encompassing the full range of networking facilities
    provided by the current IP architecture. In addition to the obvious content-fetching
    use cases which have been the subject of a large body of work, ICN has also shown
    promise as a substrate to effectively support remote computation, both pure functional
    programming (as exemplified by Named Function Networking) and more general remote
    invocation models such as RPC and web transactions. Providing a unified remote
    computation capability in ICN presents some unique challenges, among which are
    timer management, client authorization, and binding to state held by servers,
    while maintaining the advantages of ICN protocol designs like CCN and NDN. This
    document specifies a unified approach to remote method invocation in ICN that
    exploits the attractive ICN properties of name-based routing, receiver-driven
    flow and congestion control, flow balance, and object-oriented security while
    presenting a natural programming model to the application developer.</p>"
