abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect
    the\n   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.\n
    \  The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the\n   PCN
    domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain\n   configured rates
    are exceeded.  Egress nodes pass information about\n   these PCN-marks to decision
    points which then decide whether to admit\n   or block new flow requests or to
    terminate some already-admitted\n   flows during serious pre-congestion.\n\n   This
    document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP\n   header by re-using
    the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\n   codepoints within a PCN-domain.
    \ The PCN wire protocol for non-IP\n   protocol headers will need to be defined
    elsewhere.  Nonetheless,\n   this document clarifies the PCN encoding for MPLS
    in an informational\n   Appendix.  The encoding for IP provides for up to three
    different PCN\n   marking states using a single DSCP: Not-marked (NM), Threshold-marked\n
    \  (ThM) and Excess-traffic-marked (ETM).  Hence, it is called the\n   3-in-1
    PCN encoding.  This document obsoletes RFC5696.\n\t </p>\n      "
