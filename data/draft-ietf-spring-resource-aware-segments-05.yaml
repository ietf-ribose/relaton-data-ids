abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource
    attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs). Such SIDs are referred to as
    resource-aware SIDs in this document. The resource- aware SIDs retain their original
    forwarding semantics, but with the additional semantics to identify the set of
    network resources available for the packet processing and forwarding action. The
    resource-aware SIDs can therefore be used to build SR paths or virtual networks
    with a set of reserved network resources. The proposed mechanism is applicable
    to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with
    IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
