abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The SELECT protocol allows Internet users to supply their ratings
    ofInternet documents, and to use ratings provided by other users tofilter and
    select what to read In particular, SELECT supports so-calledcollaborative filtering.
    By this is meant that the filtering andselection for a particular user is made
    based on ratings provided byspecial groups of raters, such as peer groups, people
    with similarvalues, interests and expertise as the person for whom the selectingand
    filtering is done.The SELECT functionality is downwards compatible with PICS [PICS
    1,PICS 2], but a major difference is that while PICS is mainly orientedtowards
    keeping out unsuitable information from children(blackballing), SELECT is mainly
    oriented towards helping people findthe best and most valuable information for
    them on the Internet(goldballing). A syntactical difference from PICS is that
    the encodingsin SELECT are using the XML encoding format.</p>"
