abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service
    (QoS)\n   policies according to Traffic Conditioning Agreement (TCA) with their\n
    \  providers.  The enforcement of such policies often relies upon\n   vendor-specific
    configuration language.  Both learning of TCA, either\n   thru TCA documents or
    via some other out-of-band method, and\n   translating them to vendor specific
    configuration language is a\n   complex, often manual, process and prone to errors.\n\n
    \  This document specifies an optional transitive attribute to signal\n   TCA
    parameters in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered\n   as Autonomous
    Systems (AS)), thus simplifying and facilitating some\n   of the complex provisioning
    tasks in situations where BGP is\n   available as a routing protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
