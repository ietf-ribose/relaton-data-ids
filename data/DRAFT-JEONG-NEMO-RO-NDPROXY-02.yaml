abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes
    in IPv6 \nmobile network to perform route optimization.  The route optimization
    \nis possible because mobile router relays the prefix of its Care-of \naddress
    to its mobile nodes by playing the role of ND-proxy.   \nThrough binding updates
    associated with the network prefix of an \naccess network, the mobile nodes can
    perform route optimization.  In \naddition, this document explains how mobile
    nodes can optimize its \nDNS name resolution through RA-based DNS discovery.  By
    announcing \nthe address of local recursive DNS server, mobile router allows \nmobile
    nodes to optimize their DNS name resolution.\n\t </p>\n      "
