abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Pre-Congestion Notification described in[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture]
    and earlier in[I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach proposes the use of
    anAdmission Control mechanism to limit the amount of real-time PCNtraffic to a
    configured level during the normal operating conditions,and the use of a Flow
    Termination mechanism to tear-down some of theflows to bring the PCN traffic level
    down to a desirable amountduring unexpected events such as network failures, with
    the goal ofmaintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows. In[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture],
    Admission and Flow Termination usetwo different markings and two different metering
    mechanisms in theinternal nodes of the PCN region. This draft proposes a mechanismusing
    a single marking and metering for both Admission and FlowTermination, and presents
    an analysis of the tradeoffs. A side-effect of this proposal is that a different
    marking and meteringAdmission mechanism than that proposed in[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture]
    may be also feasible, and may resultin a number of benefits. In addition, this
    draft proposes amigration path for incremental deployment of this approach as
    anintermediate step to the dual-marking approach.</p>"
