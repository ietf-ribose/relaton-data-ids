abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has produced a considerable number of data models
    in the\n   YANG modelling language.  The majority of these models are used to\n
    \  model devices or monolithic functions and they allow access for\n   configuration
    and to read operational status.\n\n   A small number of YANG modules have been
    defined to model services\n   (for example, the Layer Three Virtual Private Network
    Service Model\n   produced by the L3SM working group).\n\n   This document briefly
    sets out the scope of and purpose of an IETF\n   service model, and it also shows
    where a service model might fit into\n   a Software Defined Networking architecture.
    \ Note that service models\n   do not make any assumption of how a service is
    actually engineered\n   and delivered to a customer; details of how network protocols
    and\n   devices are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other\n   models
    that are not exposed through the Customer- Provider Interface.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
