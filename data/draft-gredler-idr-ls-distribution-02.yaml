abstract:
- content: "<p>In a number of environments, a component external to a network is called
    upon to perform computations based on the network topology and current state of
    the connections within the network, including traffic engineering information.
    This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the
    network This document describes a mechanism by which links state and traffic engineering
    information can be collected from networks and shared with external components
    using the BGP routing protocol. This is achieved using a new BGP Network Layer
    Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism is applicable to
    physical and virtual links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control.
    Applications of this technique include Application Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).</p>"
