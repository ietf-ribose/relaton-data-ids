abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture
    called TURN-Lite which could simplify the data communication process between two
    hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices.
    The key mechanism in TURN-Lite is the newly defined "Couple" operation (using
    STUN [RFC5389] message format) which allows the TURN-Lite servers to be easily
    incorporated into existing CGN devices/CDN nodes which are already deployed within
    the network in a distributed manner.</p>
