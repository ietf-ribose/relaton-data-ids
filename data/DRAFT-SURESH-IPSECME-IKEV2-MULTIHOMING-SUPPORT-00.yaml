abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multihoming provides devices the ability to connect to multiple\n
    \  networks and thus, provide higher throughput and improved resilience\n   to
    network failure(s).\n\n   This document describes enhancement of Internet Key
    Exchange version\n   2 protocol [IKEv2] to support multihoming to avoid redundant
    IKE\n   negotiations to create and maintain tunnel for multiple connections\n
    \  possible between the tunnel peers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
