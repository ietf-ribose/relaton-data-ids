abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 (RFC 3775) enables a mobile node to remain reachable while
    it roams on the Internet. However, the location and movement of the mobile node
    can be revealed by the IP addresses used in signaling or data packets. In this
    document, we consider the Mobile IPv6 location privacy problem described in RFC
    4882, and propose efficient and secure techniques to protect location privacy
    of the mobile node. This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations
    (MobOpts) Research Group. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
