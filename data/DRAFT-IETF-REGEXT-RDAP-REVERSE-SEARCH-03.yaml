abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include
    query\n   capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities\n
    \  matching a given search pattern.  Even if such capabilities, commonly\n   referred
    as reverse search, respond to some needs not yet readily\n   fulfilled by the
    current Whois protocol, they have raised concerns\n   from two perspectives: server
    processing impact and data privacy.\n   Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries
    on RDAP servers processing\n   is the same as the standard searches and it can
    be reduced by\n   implementing policies to deal with large result sets, while
    data\n   privacy risks can be prevented by RDAP access control functionality.\n
    \  In the RDAP context, an entity can be associated to any defined\n   object
    class.  Therefore, a reverse search can be applied to other\n   use cases than
    the classic domain-entity scenario.  This document\n   describes an RDAP search
    query extension that allows clients to\n   request a reverse search based on the
    relationship between an object\n   and the associated entities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
