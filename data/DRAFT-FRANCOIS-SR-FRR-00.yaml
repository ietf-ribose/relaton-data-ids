abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a Fast Reroute approach aimed at providing\n
    \  link protection of nodal and adjacency segments to the Segment\n   Routing
    framework.  This FRR behavior builds on proven IP-FRR\n   concepts being LFAs,
    remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with\n   directed forwarding (DLFA).  We describe
    their implementation using\n   SR segments.  We then analyze the benefits brought
    by Segment Routing\n   to the scalability of such IP-FRR approaches.\n\n\t </p>\n
