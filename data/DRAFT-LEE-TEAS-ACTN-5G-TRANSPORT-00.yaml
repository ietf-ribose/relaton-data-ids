abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>     This draft is aimed to provide an applicability of Abstraction
    and\n     Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (ACTN) for an end-to-\n
    \    end service assurance mechanism for 5G transport network. ACTN is\n     an
    IETF standard architecture enabling virtual network operations\n     to control
    and manage large-scale multi-domain, multi-layer and\n     multi-vendor TE networks,
    so as to facilitate network\n     programmability, automation, efficient resource
    sharing. 3GPP 5G\n     requirements calls for Network Slicing support for various
    use\n     cases such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-\n     type
    communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency\n     communications
    (URLLC). In order to support these new requirements\n     over multiple transport
    networks for 5G transport, the current\n     3GPP 5G architecture needs to support
    dynamic instantiation of\n     end-to-end paths that assure service assurance
    and performance\n     guarantee for traffic classes characterized by network slicing.\n\n\t
