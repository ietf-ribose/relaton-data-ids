abstract:
- content: "<p>CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards. It differs from
    the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on the sender
    side. In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase
    function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under
    fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been
    adopted as defaults by Linux and have been used for many years. This document
    provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party implementations and to
    solicit community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.</p>"
