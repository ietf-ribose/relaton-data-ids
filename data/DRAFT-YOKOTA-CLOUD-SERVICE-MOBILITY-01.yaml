abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine
    makes\nit possible to dynamically relocate functional entities without\ntopological
    and physical constraints.  By tapping into this\ntechnique, service mobility,
    which deals with not only functional\nentities but also sessions established between
    those entities, will\nbecome possible and such capability is especially longed
    for\nrealizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks.  This document\nprovides
    the reference model for service mobility in a virtual\nenvironment and defines
    the control protocol between the virtualized\nplatform and the managing controller
    to realize service mobility.\n\t </p>\n      "
