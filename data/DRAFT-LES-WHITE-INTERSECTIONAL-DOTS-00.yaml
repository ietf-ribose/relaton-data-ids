abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Inclusion is a stated goal of the IETF but obtaining a just
    and\n   equitable inclusive result that guarantees proportional\n   representation
    from marginalized groups requires intersectionality.\n   The use of badge dots
    are IETF can signify one's intersectionality\n   status and be used to ensure
    more inclusion and further social\n   justice.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
