abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Within the ITU H.323 recommendation, the gatekeeper is a central\n
    \  point of communication for H.323 elements within a zone. All elements\n   within
    the zone establish a communication channel with the gatekeeper\n   over a registration,
    admission, and status (RAS) channel. Elements\n   within a zone register with
    the gatekeeper and are subsequently able\n   to communicate with other elements
    in the zone, or outside of the\n   zone.\n \n   What is needed in addition to
    the normal registration and connection\n   admission procedures of H.323 is a
    means of acquiring information\n   about elements in other zones. This document
    describes the framework\n   for a peer gatekeeper routing protocol (pgrp) which
    allows\n   gatekeepers to exchange information with other gatekeepers about\n
    \  elements in their respective zones.\n \n   PGRP is a protocol supports the
    exchange of information among\n   gatekeepers which may be used to make call routing
    decisions in a\n   network. PGRP attempts to extend reliability concepts from\n
    \  telecommunications by incorporating maintenance state information\n   exchange.
    This allows call routing decisions to be based upon the\n   operational state
    of elements in the network. This feature is\n   particularly useful in the H.323
    gatekeeper mediated call model where\n   a call may be completed to a pool of
    connection endpoints. An example\n   of such a scenario is in the use of an H.323
    to connect telecom end\n   offices which connect to multiple H.323 gateways. In
    this context,\n   pgrp is also able to support call distribution to balance the
    call\n   load among the connection gateways serving an end office.\n\n\t </p>\n
