- content: "<p>IP addresses as the communication identifier bear more and more properties
    to meet different requirements. The privacy protection, accountability, security,
    and manageability of networks can be supported by extending the DHCPv6 protocol
    according to requirements. This document provides current extension practices
    and typical DHCPv6 server softwares on extensions, defines a DHCPv6 general model,
    discusses some extension points, and presents extension cases.</p>"
