abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A homenet must be aware of its borders, and the realms within
    those.\n   This document proposes an approach to bootstrap trust in such an\n
    \  environment.  The idea is to select one device as the trust anchor\n   and
    to enrol other devices into the domain.  The result is the\n   creation of a domain
    of trust in the homenet, with a common trust\n   anchor.  This trust model can
    subsequently be used to determine\n   boundaries, and to autonomically bootstrap
    network services.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
