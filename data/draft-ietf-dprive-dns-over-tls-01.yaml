abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of TLS to provide privacy for DNS.
    Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path
    tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7258. In addition,
    this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS-over-TLS and provides advice
    on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with
    DNS. Note: this document was formerly named draft-ietf-dprive-start-tls-for-dns.
    Its name has been changed to better describe the mechanism now used. Please refer
    to working group archives under the former name for history and previous discussion.
    [RFC Editor: please remove this paragraph prior to publication]</p>"
