abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   T1.X1 is the ANSI accredited T1 Technical Subcommitee responsible
    for\n   developing SONET standards, including SONET rates, formats and\n   payload
    mappings.  Its output is also brought into the ITU, for\n   example as in ITU-T
    Recommendation G.707 [G.707].\n \n   The IETF-recommended way to run HDLC over
    SONET is to use the\n   definition found in T1.X1 ANSI documents [T1.105.02, T1.105]
    and ITU\n   document [G.707].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
