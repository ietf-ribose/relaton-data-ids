abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms to allow CT log submitters to submit
    name redacted certificates. While public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs allow
    anyone to observe server certificates and make confident to trust Certificate
    Authorities (CAs), there are some problems scaling to mass devices. This document
    presents some use cases, and describes a use of name redacted certificates that
    retains most of the security benefits that gained from using Certificate Transparency.</p>"
