abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to
    create \nis a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK).  Rather than create
    \na set of monolithic protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to \nbreak
    the reliable multicast protocols into Building Blocks (BB) and \nProtocol Instantiations
    (PI).  A Building Block is a specification of \nthe algorithms of a single component,
    with an abstract interface to \nother BBs and PIs.  A PI combines a set of BBs,
    adds in the \nadditional required functionality not specified in any BB, and \nspecifies
    the specific instantiation of the protocol. \n\t </p>\n      "
