abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A shared-media LAN like Ethernet may have multiple PIM-SM routers\nconnected
    to it. In a scenario where two or more routers are connected \nto the same LAN
    and if only one of the PIM-SM Routers has members\njoined for a particular group,
    all the other routers will receive the \nsame traffic. Since no members are joined
    for this group in the\nrouters, each time when data is received, the PIM-SM has
    the overhead \nof processing all these data packets in the control plane to decide
    \nwhere to route the packet. \nTo avoid this, an (S, G) or (*, G) Entry with NULL
    Oif list is \ncreated so that discarding of the packets will be handled efficiently
    \nin the data plane as opposed to searching the route entry in the \ncontrol plane
    and then dropping the packet.\n\t </p>\n      "
