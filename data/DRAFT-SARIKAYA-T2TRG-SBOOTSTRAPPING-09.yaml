abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft provides an overview of the various terms that are
    used\n   when discussing bootstrapping of devices.  We document terms that\n   have
    been used within the IETF as well as other standards bodies.  We\n   investigate
    if the terms refer to the same phenomena or have subtle\n   differences.  We provide
    recommendations on the applicability of\n   terms in different contexts.  Finally,
    this document presents a\n   survey of secure bootstrapping mechanisms available
    for smart objects\n   that are part of an Internet of Things (IoT) network.  The
    survey\n   does not prescribe any one mechanism and rather presents IoT\n   developers
    with different options to choose from, depending on their\n   use-case, security
    requirements, and the user interface available on\n   their IoT devices.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
