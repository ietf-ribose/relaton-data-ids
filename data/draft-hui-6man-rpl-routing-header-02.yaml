abstract:
  content: "<p>In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routersmay
    limit them to maintaining at most a few routes. In someconfigurations, it is necessary
    to use these memory constrainedrouters to deliver datagrams to nodes within the
    LLN. The Routingfor Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol can be used in
    somedeployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g. theDirected Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward theIPv6 datagram using a source routing
    technique to avoid large routingtables on memory constrained routers. This document
    specifies a newIPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPLdomain.</p>"
