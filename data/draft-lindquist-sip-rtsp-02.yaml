abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishingmultimedia
    sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)is used in streaming
    media systems. RTSP has a dual role: itestablishes a media session for the delivery
    of streaming media aswell as controls the streaming session once it has been set
    up.Since SIP is also used for session establishment, there exists anoverlap between
    the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP. In thisdocument, we describe a model
    adopted by ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, and OpenIPTV Forum (OIPF) in which SIP and the SDP
    offer/answer model areused to set up a streaming session with an RTSP control
    channel andone or more media delivery streams. Such a model is beneficial sinceit
    allows the reuse of current architecture and functionality (e.g.,authentication,
    charging, and QoS) established around SIP for RTSP-based streaming. The model
    benefits applications such as InternetProtocol Television (IPTV). In addition
    to the model, the documentspecifies two new variants of RTSP.</p>"
