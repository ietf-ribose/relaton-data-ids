abstract:
  content: "<p>This document presents considerations related to open issues with upcoming
    new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming to set a basis for documenting
    problem space, use-cases, and potential solutions related to next-generation network
    infrastructure. The draft reviews currently investigated topics, including both
    inputs from IETF and from other SDOs as well as research activities. Further the
    outcome of recent discussions at side sessions during IETF meetings are recaptured
    to help identifying a starting point for future thoughts.</p>"
