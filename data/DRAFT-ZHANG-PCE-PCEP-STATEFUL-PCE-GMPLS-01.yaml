abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering\n
    \  (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or\n   multi-layer
    networks. PCE can be stateless or stateful. With the LSP\n   state information
    acquired from the network, a stateful PCE enables\n   a wide variety of applications,
    especially in GMPLS networks, such\n   as impairment-aware routing and wavelength
    assignment in wavelength-\n   switched optical networks (WSON), time-based scheduling
    applications.\n   This memo provides extensions required for PCE communication\n
    \  protocol (i.e. PCEP) so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE\n   capability
    in GMPLS networks. To be more specific, the PCEP\n   extensions specified in this
    memo include not only new objects but\n   also modification of existing objects
    in PCEP messages.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
