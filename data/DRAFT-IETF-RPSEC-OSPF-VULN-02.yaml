abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very early\nstages
    of computer networks when \"cyberspace\" was still perceived as\na benign environment.
    \ As a consequence, malicious attacks were not\nconsidered to be a major risk
    when these protocols were designed,\nleaving today's Internet vulnerable.  This
    paper provides an analysis\nof OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to
    modify the normal\nrouting process across a single domain together with an assessment
    of\nwhen internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to better\nsecure
    a domain.\n\t </p>\n      "
