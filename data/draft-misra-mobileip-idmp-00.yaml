abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document introduces IDMP, a mobility protocol that supportsrouting
    of datagrams to a mobile node inside a mobility domain. Amobility domain essentially
    identifies a collection of IP subnets andnetworks that are aggregated together
    based on factors such asgeographic proximity or administrative control. In addition
    tosupporting basic redirection of packets to mobile nodes, IDMP alsoprovides fast
    handoff support, with minimal packet losses due tomobility-related transients,
    and paging support to reduce thesignaling burden on mobile nodes. IDMP uses two
    care-of addresses tomanage mobility. The global care-of address identifies the
    mobile'scurrent domain and remains unchanged as long as the mobile does notchange
    domains. The local care-of address identifies the mobile'scurrent point of attachment
    and changes every time a mobile nodechanges subnets. IDMP specifies two types
    of agents, Subnet Agentsand Mobility Agents, to support this two-layer mobility
    hierarchy.By using two care-of addresses , IDMP removes the need forhost-specific
    routing inside the domain and allows the use ofmultiple alternative protocols
    for supporting global mobility.</p>"
