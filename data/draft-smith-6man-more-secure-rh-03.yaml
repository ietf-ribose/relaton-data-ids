abstract:
- content: "<p>The original IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header has been deprecated due to
    the security risk of a packet forwarding loop being formed, by specifying a large
    sequence of alternating IPv6 node addresses to visit. This memo proposes a method
    to prevent these forwarding loops forming, allowing the IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header
    to be more securely and more safely used. The method may also be applicable to
    other unicast source routing scenarios.</p>"
