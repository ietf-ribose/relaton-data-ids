abstract:
- content: "<p>A means of provisioning OATH shared secret OTP parameters based on
    the XKMS protocol is described. The techniques used may be extended to support
    XKMS registration of symmetric keys for other cryptographic protocols. It is hoped
    that publication of this note will allow others to make use of the same architectural
    approach as a starting point for future proposals. This work is a joint effort
    by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify an algorithm
    that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe
    that a common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor
    authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability commercial and open-source
    implementations.</p>"
