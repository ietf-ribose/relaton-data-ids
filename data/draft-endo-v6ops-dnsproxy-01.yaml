abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DNS Proxy that is separated from NAT-PT
    [RFC2766]. NAT-PT was designed to work with DNS Application Level Gateway. However
    [RFC4966] pointed out DNS related issues, and [RFC2766] was changed to historical
    state. This document attempts to DNS Proxy specification, removing dependency
    on NAT-PT as well as resolving problems pointed in [RFC4966].</p>"
