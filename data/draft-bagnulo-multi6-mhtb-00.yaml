abstract:
  content: "\t <t>RFC 3178 [1] describes a solution to provide site multi-homingsupport
    in IPv6. RFC 3178 multi-homing solution uses tunnels betweenthe different ISPs
    and the multi-homed site to provide alternativepaths in case that one of the exit
    links is down, protecting themulti-homed site from outages in the direct link
    with its providers.However, the wide adoption of RFC 3178 multi-homing solution
    impliesthe manual configuration of numerous tunnels on the ISPs, which mayimpose
    an important workload in ISP network administrators. This noteproposes the usage
    of Multi-Homing Tunnel Brokers to automaticallyconfigure the ISP tunnel endpoint
    in order to ease the adoption ofthe solution.</p>"
