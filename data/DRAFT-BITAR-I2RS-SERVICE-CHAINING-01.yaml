abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>        Service chaining is the concept of applying an ordered
    set of\n        services to a packet or a flow. Services in the chain may\n        include
    network services such as load-balancing, firewalling,\n        intrusion prevention,
    and routing among others. Criteria for\n        applying a service chain to a
    packet or flow can be based on\n        packet/flow attributes that span the OSI
    layers (e.g., physical\n        port, Ethernet MAC header information, IP header
    information,\n        transport, and application layer information). This document\n
    \       describes use cases and I2RS (Information to the Rousting\n        System)
    requirements for the discovery and maintenance of\n        services topology and
    resources. It also describes use cases\n        and I2RS requirements for controlling
    the forwarding of a\n        packet/flow along a service chain based on packet/flow\n
    \       attributes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
