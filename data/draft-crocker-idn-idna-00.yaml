abstract:
  content: "<p>Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) use Unicode fordomain name, rather
    than using a subset of ASCII. Thisincreased name space, as well the requirement
    tomaintain compatibility with the existing domain nameservice means that IDNs
    must be encoded in a form thatcan be supported without changes to any portion
    of theDNS that does not participate in the upgrade to IDN.This specification defines
    a mechanism called IDNA forhandling them in a standard fashion and specifies anIDNA
    profile for domain names used as host references.IDNA allows non-ASCII characters
    to be represented usingthe same octets used in so-called host names today. Thisrepresentation
    allows IDNs to be introduced with minimalchanges to the existing DNS infrastructure.
    IDNA is onlymeant for processing domain names, not free text.</p>"
