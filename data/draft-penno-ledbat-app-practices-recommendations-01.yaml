abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections. For example,P2P
    applications maintain connections to a number of different peersand web browsers
    perform concurrent download from the same webserver. Application designers pursue
    different goals when doing so:P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected mesh
    in the swarm whileweb browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize
    requeststhat involve application latency on the web server side. Howeverthis practice
    also has impacts to the host and the network as awhole. For example, an application
    can obtain a larger fraction ofthe bottleneck than if it had used fewer connections.
    Althoughcapacity is the most commonly considered bottleneck resource,middlebox
    state table entries are also an important resource for anend system communication.This
    document clarifies the current practices of application designinvolving concurrent
    TCP connections and reasons behind them, anddiscusses the tradeoffs surrounding
    their use, whether to onedestination or to different destinations. Other resource
    types mayexist, and the guidelines are expected to comprehensively discussthem.Conventions
    used in this documentThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.</p>"
