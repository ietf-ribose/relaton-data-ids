abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Domain name registries and registrars report to each other
    by sharing\n   bulk information through files.  This document creates two IANA\n
    \  registries to create a standard reporting mechanism between domain\n   name
    registries and registrars.  The first IANA registry lists\n   standard data elements
    and their syntax for inclusion in the files.\n   The second IANA registry lists
    standard reports based on the standard\n   data elements.  Each report is a file
    formatted as a CSV file.  The\n   advantage of this reporting mechanism is that
    reports, each file, can\n   be imported by recipients without any prior knowledge
    of their\n   contents, although reporting is enhanced with a minimum of knowledge\n
    \  about the files.  The mechanism for the transmission and reception of\n   the
    files is a matter of local policy.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
