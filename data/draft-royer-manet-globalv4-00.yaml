abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes how to provide Internet connectivity tomobile
    ad hoc networks. It describes a mechanism whereby the Adhoc On-Demand Distance
    Vector (AODV) Routing protocol can cooperatewith the Mobile IP protocol such that
    mobile nodes within an ad hocnetwork, which are out of direct transmission range
    of a foreignagent, can obtain a care-of address and register with the foreignagent
    to obtain Internet connectivity. Mobile IP is used for mobilenode registrations
    with a foreign agent, while AODV is used forrouting within the ad hoc network
    and for obtaining routes to theforeign agent. Once a manet node has a care-of
    address, it may senddata packets to destinations in the Internet by routing through
    theforeign agent.</p>"
