abstract:
- content: <p>In some inter-AS (Autonomous System) and inter-area deployment scenarios
    for RFC 4379 ("Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and Traceroute"), a replying Label
    Switching Router (LSR) may not have the available route to an initiator, and the
    Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded, resulting in false
    negatives or a complete failure of operation of the LSP Ping and Traceroute. This
    document describes extensions to the LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying
    LSR to have the capability to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate
    nodes to the initiator. This document updates RFC 4379.</p>
