abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
    version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
    version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.
    The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0,
    and was, until recently, documented as a comletely separate protocol. This document
    will give rise to a suite of documents which collectively obsolete RFC 8881. In
    addition to many corrections and clarifications, it will rely on NFSv4-wide documents
    to substantially revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization,
    and security, superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the protocol appearing
    in RFCs 5661 and 8881.</p>"
