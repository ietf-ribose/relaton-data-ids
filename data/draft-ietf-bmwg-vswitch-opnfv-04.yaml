abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes the contributions of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)
    project on Virtual Switch Performance (VSPERF), particularly in the areas of test
    setups and configuration parameters for the system under test. This project has
    extended the current and completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working
    Group in the IETF and references existing literature. The Benchmarking Methodology
    Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated
    physical implementations of internetworking functions. Therefore, this memo describes
    the additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on general-purpose
    hardware. The expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV mission
    to support virtualization of the "telco" infrastructure.</p>
