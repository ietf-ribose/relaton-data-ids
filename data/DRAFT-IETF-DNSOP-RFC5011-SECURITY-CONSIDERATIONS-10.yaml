abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing\n
    \  advice that must be followed by the publisher in order to maintain\n   security.
    \ Specifically, this document describes the math behind the\n   minimum time-length
    that a DNS zone publisher must wait before\n   signing exclusively with recently
    added DNSKEYs.  This document also\n   describes the minimum time-length that
    a DNS zone publisher must wait\n   after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming
    that all active\n   RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation-marked key
    and\n   removed it from their list of trust anchors.\n\n   This document contains
    much math and complicated equations, but the\n   summary is that the key rollover
    / revocation time is much longer\n   than intuition would suggest.  If you are
    not both publishing a\n   DNSSEC DNSKEY, and using RFC5011 to advertise this DNSKEY
    as a new\n   Secure Entry Point key for use as a trust anchor, you probably don't\n
    \  need to read this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
