abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>DiffServ architecture provides a set of 'user plane' tools for
    IP QoS.\nDeployment of DiffServ is starting with static, single-domain solutions.\nDynamic
    QoS and multi-domain QoS are still open issues, as witnessed by\nthe activity
    of the IETF NSIS WG, related to the 'signaling plane'.\nIn order to realize true
    end-to-end QoS services in the Internet,\nspanning multiple administrative domains,
    efficient and scalable\nsignaling and resource control mechanisms are needed.\nThis
    document describes a scalable inter-domain resource control\narchitecture for
    DiffServ networks. The architecture is called BGRP\nPlus, as it extends the previously
    proposed BGRP framework.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
