abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses the communication between an application\n
    \  server and media server.  The current work in SIPPING and XCON\n   working
    groups show these logical entities but do not address the\n   physical decomposition
    and the protocol between the entities.\n\n   This document presents the requirements
    from a media server control\n   protocol (MCP) that enables an application server
    to use a media\n   server.  It will address the aspects of announcements, IVR
    and\n   conferencing media services.\n\t </p>\n      "
