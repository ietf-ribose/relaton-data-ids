abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses issues with assigning an IP address to
    a host\ninterface such that the IP address may only be used with a restricted\nset
    of ports.  This concept is referred to herein as a port-\nrestricted IP address.
    \ A number of issues with this concept are\ndocumented, and the issues are contrasted
    with other approaches to\ndealing with IPv4 address exhaustion.\n\t </p>\n      "
