abstract:
- content: "<p>Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple administrative
    domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models. This document proposes the use
    of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services to offer topology and
    resources addressing network service discovery and provisioning by multi-domain
    orchestrators. The ALTO services with the proposed protocol extensions offer aggregated
    views on various types of resources contributing to a more simple and scalable
    solution for resource and service discovery in multi-domain, multi-technology
    environments.</p>"
