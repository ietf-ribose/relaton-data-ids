abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile IPv6 allows a MN to receive incoming packets to its home\naddress
    while it is away from its home network.  In a heterogeneous\nenvironment, a MN
    may have multiple interfaces, each with different\ncharacteristics.  While a MN
    is in a visited network, due to the\nperformance of the interfaces or to the user
    preferences, the MN may\nwant to forbid the redirection from its home agent of
    a kind of flow,\nor to indicate a target CoA for a kind of flow.  In this draft,
    we\npropose new mobility options that allow a MN to advertise filters to\nits
    home agent.  A filter is associated with a CoA, in such a way\nthat the MN can
    register several CoA and can register several filters\nfor one CoA.  A filter
    may indicate that a flow which maps to a\nfilter must be dropped or must be redirected
    to the indicated CoA.\n\t </p>\n      "
