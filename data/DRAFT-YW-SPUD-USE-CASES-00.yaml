abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The purpose of SPUD is to provide a standardized layer below
    the\n   transport layer, to behavior as a communication channel between the\n
    \  host and network devices.  So when a new transport protocol is\n   deployed,
    it's easy for network devices to cooperate with it.  New\n   transports could
    have a common encapsulation to middleboxes.  On the\n   other hand, the transport
    layer could also make use of the state of\n   network devices collected by the
    SPUD, to improve transport\n   performance.\n\n   This document provides some
    exemplary use cases for SPUD, especially\n   in stateful firewall and TCP optimization.
    \ The objective of this\n   draft is not to cover all conceivable p2a or a2p signaling
    in detail.\n   Rather, the intention is to explain the requirements in these use\n
    \  cases as far as it is required to complement the problem statement of\n   the
    SPUD.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
