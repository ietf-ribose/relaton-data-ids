abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\n
    \  stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\n   most
    costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router\n   hardware simply
    because the FIB has run out of space, and router\n   vendors must design routers
    that have adequate FIB.\n\n   FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress
    on the FIB by NOT\n   loading selected RIB entries into the FIB.  Simple Virtual\n
    \  Aggregation (S-VA) is a simple form of Virtual Aggregation (VA) that\n   allows
    any and all edge routers to shrink their RIB and FIB\n   requirements substantially
    and therefore increase their useful\n   lifetime.\n\n   S-VA does not increase
    FIB requirements for core routers.  S-VA is\n   extremely easy to configure considerably
    more so than the various\n   tricks done today to extend the life of edge routers.
    \ S-VA can be\n   deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is
    not\n   required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.\n\n\t </p>\n
