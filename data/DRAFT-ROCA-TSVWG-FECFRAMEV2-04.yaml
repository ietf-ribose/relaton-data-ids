abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction\n
    \  (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP networks to\n   provide
    protection against packet loss.  The framework supports\n   applying FEC to arbitrary
    packet flows over unreliable transport and\n   is primarily intended for real-time,
    or streaming, media.  However\n   FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block
    FEC codes.  The\n   present document extends FECFRAME to support FEC Codes based
    on a\n   sliding encoding window, in addition to Block FEC Codes, in a\n   backward
    compatible way.  During multicast/broadcast real-time\n   content delivery, the
    use of sliding window codes significantly\n   improves robustness in harsh environments,
    with less repair traffic\n   and lower FEC-related added latency.\n\n\t </p>\n
