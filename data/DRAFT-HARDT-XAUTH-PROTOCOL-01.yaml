abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Client software often desires resources or identity claims
    that are\n   managed independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/\n
    \  or resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release\n   of
    identity claims to an authorization server.  Client software can\n   then request
    access to resources and/or identity claims by calling\n   the authorization server.
    \ The authorization server acquires consent\n   and authorization from the user
    and/or resource owner if required,\n   and then returns the authorization and
    identity claims that were\n   approved.  This protocol can be extended to support
    alternative\n   client authentication mechanisms, authorizations, claims, and\n
    \  interactions.\n\n   [Editor: suggestions on how to improve this are welcome!]\n\n
    \  [Editor: suggestions for other names than XAuth are welcome!]\n\n\t </p>\n
