abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined how
    the\n   WebRTC framework can be used to provide access to IMS services.\n   Users
    can use \"web credentials\" (e.g. a username and password) to\n   retrieve an
    authorization token (e.g. an OAuth 2.0 access token),\n   which is included in
    the user registration request sent towards the\n   IMS network.\n\n   3GPP has
    specified a requirement, that the eP-CSCF shall be able to\n   include a string
    value, representing the identity of the WAF, in the\n   REGISTER request forwarded
    towards the S-CSCF.  The S-CSCF can use\n   the identity for e.g. policy and routing
    decisions.\n\n   This document defines a new Authorization header field parameter,\n
    \  'authorization-entity', which the eP-CSCF can include in a REGISTER\n   request
    in order to convey the identity of the WAF towards the\n   S-CSCF.\n\n\t </p>\n
