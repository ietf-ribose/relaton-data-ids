abstract:
- content: "<p>When two endpoints with multiple media sources are in communication,
    each media source or each receiver within either endpoint may send or receive
    reception report independently. This may incur a lot of duplicated reception report
    to and from the endpoint with multiple sources. This document discusses how to
    tackle these problems and propose three phases for suppressing reception reports.</p>"
