abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar
    contains\n   the \"name-addr / addr-spec\" alternative to use name-addr when certain\n
    \  characters appear.  Unfortunately it expressed the constraints with\n   prose
    copied into each header field definition, and at least one\n   header field was
    missed.  Further, the constraint has not been copied\n   into documents defining
    extension headers whose grammar contains the\n   alternative.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC3261 to state the constraint generically,\n   and clarifies that the
    constraint applies to all SIP header fields\n   where there is a choice between
    using name-addr or addr-spec.  It\n   also updates the RFCs that define extension
    SIP header fields using\n   the alternative to clarify that the constraint applies
    (RFCs 3325,\n   3515, 3892, 4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
