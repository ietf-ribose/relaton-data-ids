abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a simple, incremental, autonomous system
    \n\n (AS)-based inter-domain routing architecture to solve the scalability \n\n
    problems of the Internet, by separation of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) \n\n for
    identifying endpoints and Routing Identifiers (RIDs) for locating \n\n endpoints
    in the Internet. The proposed architecture uses AS numbers \n\n as RIDs so that
    global routing tables can grow only with of AS \n\n numbers, thus avoiding the
    rapid growth driven by constantly \n\n increasing IP prefixes. \n\n\n This proposal
    was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the \n\n Amsterdam IAB Routing
    and Addressing Workshop in October 2006.\n\t </p>\n      "
