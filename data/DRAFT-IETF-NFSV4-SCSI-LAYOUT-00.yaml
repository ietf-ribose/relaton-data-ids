abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File Sharing version 4
    (RFC5661)\n   to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used
    by\n   the NFSv4 server.  This ability to bypass the server for data access\n
    \  can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires\n   additional
    client functionality for data access, some of which is\n   dependent on the class
    of storage used.  The main pNFS operations\n   document specifies storage-class-independent
    extensions to NFS, the\n   pNFS Block/Volume Layout (RFC5663) specifies the additional\n
    \  extensions for use of pNFS with block-and volume-based storage, while\n   this
    document provides extensions to the pNFS Block/Volume Layout\n   document to provide
    reliable fencing and better device\n   discoverability for SCSI based shared storage
    devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
