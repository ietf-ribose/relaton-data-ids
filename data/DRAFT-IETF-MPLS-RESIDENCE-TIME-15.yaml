abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies a new Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
    for Residence Time Measurement (RTM) and describes how it can be used by time
    synchronization protocols within an MPLS domain.\n\n Residence time is the variable
    part of the propagation delay of timing and synchronization messages; knowing
    this delay for each message allows for a more accurate determination of the delay
    to be taken into account when applying the value included in a Precision Time
    Protocol event message.\n\t </p>\n      "
