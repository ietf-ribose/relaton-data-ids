abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to encapsulate IPv6 packets
    over\n   the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).  The LLDP is a single\n   layer-two
    protocol with its own ethertype.  It is never forwarded,\n   which is a desireable
    property when building the IPv6-over-IPsec-\n   over-IPv6-Link-Local tunnels that
    make up the ANIMA Autonomic Control\n   Plane (ACP).\n\n   This unorthodox encapsulation
    avoids unwanted interactions between\n   the ACP packets and native packet forwarding
    engines, as well as\n   being safe for layer-2 switches which might otherwise
    have no IPv6\n   capabilities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
