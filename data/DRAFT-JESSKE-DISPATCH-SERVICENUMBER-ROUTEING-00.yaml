abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The combination of \"rn\" and \"npdi\" parameters which are normally
    used\nfor number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing\nproblems.
    \ Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not only\nneeded for NP, but also
    for the routing of service numbers and short\ncode numbers in the PSTN and also
    in SIP networks.  This document\ndefines the use of the tel URI parameters defined
    for NP (\"rn\" and\n\"npdi\") to route service numbers and short code numbers.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
