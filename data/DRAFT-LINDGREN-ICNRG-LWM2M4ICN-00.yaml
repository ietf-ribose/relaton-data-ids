abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet-of-things (IoT) supports many applications and
    services\n   where collection and distribution of data from and to devices is\n
    \  central, fitting the named data communication model of information-\n   centric
    networking (ICN) quite well.  Many applications and use cases\n   of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) imply information centric usage\n   patterns.  The IoT differs
    from many typical information centric\n   application because of the dynamic nature
    of IoT devices and the\n   large number of such devices.  This creates a requirement
    for easy\n   deployability in new locations without the need for complex setup
    or\n   configuration of the devices.  This draft provides a study of how the\n
    \  OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol for IoT device management can\n   potentially
    be used for configuration and management of ICN\n   parameters in an IoT network.
    \ We will address some of the tradeoffs\n   that need to be considered and give
    an initial example of how key\n   LWM2M functionality can be mapped to the ICN/IoT
    scenario.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
