abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes virtual machine mobility solutions
    commonly\n   used in data centers built with overlay-based network. This document\n
    \  is intended for describing the solutions and the impact of moving\n   VMs (or
    applications) from one Rack to another connected by the\n   Overlay networks.\n\n
    \  For layer 2, it is based on using an NVA (Network Virtualization\n   Authority)
    - NVE (Network Virtualization Edge) protocol to update\n   ARP (Address Resolution
    Protocol) table or neighbor cache entries\n   after a VM (virtual machine) moves
    from an Old NVE to a New NVE.\n   For Layer 3, it is based on address and connection
    migration after\n   the move.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
