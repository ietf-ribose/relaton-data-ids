abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation
    for\nDefining the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IP\nProtocol
    Specifications. Which is accomplished by first, Renaming\nthese Protocols to 'IPt1'
    and 'IPt2', where the 't' represents\n'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And
    second, by eliminating\neither all, or most of the extraneous information, which
    is not\nessential (at least not anymore) for understanding the overall\nSchematic
    Structure, nor the benefits, these Protocol Specifications\nactually represent.
    Which is further emphasized with a comparison,\nthat uses The New and the Modern
    Binary Systems. Where is it shown\nthat an increase in efficiency still exist,
    while the Number of IP\nAddresses remains Astronomically Large in both cases.\nIn
    other words, the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2' IP Specifications represents a\nformat, which
    is nothing more than a 'Telephone Number Implementation'\nthat can be used as
    the primary IP Addressing format in any\nTelecommunications System, regardless
    of the choice for the Method in\nBinary Enumeration. Which means, in essence,
    this a Telecommunications\nProtocol that is essentially the 'Computer's Telephone
    Number'.\n\t </p>\n      "
