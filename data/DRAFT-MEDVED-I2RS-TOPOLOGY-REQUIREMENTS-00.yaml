abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes requirements for collecting topology
    data\n   from network elements and other sources, creating a coherent view of\n
    \  the network topology from the collected data, and presenting the\n   topology
    view to various applications that need to: a) understand the\n   topology; and,
    b) leverage topology information in order to improve\n   application specific
    mechanisms such as path selection, resources\n   reservation, etc.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
