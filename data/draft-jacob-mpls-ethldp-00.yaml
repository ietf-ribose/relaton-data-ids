abstract:
  content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can
    carryanydata payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision
    new servicewith any expense. The benefit of this technology is core router need
    not understand thefull customer route. If the service a layer 2 then thereis no
    need of vrf, for customer theservice provider cloud is like a virtual switch.The
    protocol used for label distribution is LDP,BGP,RSVP. The most popular protocol
    for outer label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit ofadding more TLV to
    its payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating labelsfor mac
    address rather for ip address which gives the benefit to service provider not
    torun complex routing protocol on core, this does not require ip address. This
    gives serviceprovider the flexibility to deploy any services, there is no need
    for changes in network layer when thecustomer goes for ipv4 to ipv6. This can
    reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reduces thehardware cost too.</p>"
