abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an open and extensible log format to be used
    by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and trace activities that occur
    in the cloud. The logs and traces can be utilized for billing, charging, and debugging
    purposes. In addition, these logs and traces are equally applicable for cloud
    infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services. CloudLog
    is different in content, but not in nature from the traditional logging as it
    takes in account transient nature of Identities and resources in the cloud.</p>"
