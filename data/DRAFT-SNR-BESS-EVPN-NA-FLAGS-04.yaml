abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MAC/IP Advertisement route specified in [RFC7432] can optionally\n
    \  carry IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote\n   PEs
    can use this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4\n   ARP requests
    and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages and\n   reduce/suppress the flooding produced
    by the Address Resolution\n   procedure. However, if the Neighbor information
    is learnt via EVPN,\n   the PE would not know if a particular IPv6-&gt;MAC pair
    belongs to a\n   host, a router or a host with an anycast address as this information\n
    \  is not carried in the MAC/IP route advertisements. This document\n   proposes
    an OPTIONAL advertisement of the Flags defined in [RFC4861]\n   along with the
    EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes, so that an EVPN PE\n   implementing a proxy-ND
    function can reply to Neighbor Solicitations\n   with the correct Flag information
    in Neighbor Advertisements.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
