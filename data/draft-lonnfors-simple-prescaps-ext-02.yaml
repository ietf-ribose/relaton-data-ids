    in IMPP Working Group. IMPP WG has come up with baselineinteroperable operations
    and formats for Presence and InstantMessaging systems. However, these base formats
    might needstandardized extensions in order to enable building rationalapplications

    document format to be used inSIMPLE based Presence systems [1] but may also be
    applied to otherprotocols as well.</p>"
