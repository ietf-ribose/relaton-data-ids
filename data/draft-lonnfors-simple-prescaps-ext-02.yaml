abstract:
- content: "<p>Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been defined
    in IMPP Working Group. IMPP WG has come up with baseline interoperable operations
    and formats for Presence and Instant Messaging systems. However, these base formats
    might need standardized extensions in order to enable building rational applications
    using Presence and Instant Messaging. This memo proposes an extension to PIDF
    presence document format to be used in SIMPLE based Presence systems [1] but may
    also be applied to other protocols as well.</p>"
