abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Organisations such as BBC Monitoring monitor radio and television\nbroadcasts
    worldwide.  Traditional monitoring methods incur expensive\ninternational telephone
    call charges.  This document describes a\nsystem whereby remote broadcasts can
    be monitored using a computer\nconnected to a radio or television receiver and
    to the Internet,\nusing inexpensive local calls to its local Internet Service
    Provider.\nThis document also defines the protocol used between the central\nserver
    and the remote clients which implement this system.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
