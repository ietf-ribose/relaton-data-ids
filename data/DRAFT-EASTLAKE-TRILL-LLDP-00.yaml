abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP, IEEE Std 802.1AB)
    is a one-\n   way, unacknowledged protocol for the announcement of a station's\n
    \  capabilities to its peers.  The set of peers that receive these\n   frames
    and the scoping of the frame, such as whether or not it\n   traverses certain
    types of bridges, is primarily determined by the\n   destination MAC address of
    the LLDP frame.  This document specifies\n   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links) support of LLDP\n   and updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
