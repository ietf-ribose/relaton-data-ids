abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (RFC-
    4193) can be used in wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as MANET Local IPv6
    Addresses (MLAs). MLAs are intended to be used inside a MANET and are not expected
    to be routable on the global Internet. Each MANET router is expected to generate
    its MLA locally without any coordination with other MANET routers.</p>"
