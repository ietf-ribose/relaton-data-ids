abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The protocol described in this document provides the basis
    for the IP\n   Device  Control  (IPDC)  family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols
    are\n   proposed as a  protocol  suite,  components  of  which  can  be  used\n
    \  individually   or  together  to  perform  connection  control,  media\n   control,
    and signaling transport for environments where  the  service\n   control logic
    is separated from the network access server. Please see\n   the references section
    for other IPDC documents.\n \n   According to the framework provided by Cuervo
    et  al  [1],  the  IPDC\n   protocol  suite operates between the Media Gateway
    Controller and the\n   Media Gateway.  In terms of previous contributions to the
    experts  of\n   Questions  13-14/16,  the corresponding entities are the Call
    Control\n   and Media Control portions of the H.323 Gateway.   The  operation
    \ of\n   IPDC in the service of H.323 is clarified in a companion contribution\n
    \  entitled 'IPDC Architectural Framework' [3].\n\n\t </p>\n      "
