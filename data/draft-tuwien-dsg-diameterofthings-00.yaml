abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter of Things (DoT) protocol is intended to provide a realtime
    telemetry framework for IoT applications in resource-constraint gateways. Such
    metering capability is needed when lack of resources among competing applications
    dictates our schedule and credit allocation. The DoT protocol can be incorporated
    to implement real-time AAA of IoT services for prepaid subscribers. The DoT employs
    mechanisms to meter the IoT composite application units used/charged over a client
    credit. Such metering methods come in two models of session-based and event-based
    patterns. The former is used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously
    consumed while the latter is typically used when units are implicit invocation
    events.</p>"
