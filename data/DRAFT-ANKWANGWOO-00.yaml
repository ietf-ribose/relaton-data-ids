abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo provides information on the transition of IPV4\nto IPV6.
    \ This information explains the IPV6's address \npacket definition.  The method
    used is an efficient way to \ncontrol all electric goods in a network with one
    IP \naddress (telephone number).\nThis type of packet definition will reduce hop
    count which\ndramatically improves speed, reliability, connections, and\noverall
    performance.\n\t </p>\n      "
