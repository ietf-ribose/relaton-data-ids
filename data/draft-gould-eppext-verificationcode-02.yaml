abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) extension
    for including a verification code for marking the data for a transform command
    as being verified by a 3rd party, which is referred to as the Verification Service
    Provider (VSP). The verification code is digitally signed by the VSP using XML
    Signature and is "base64" encoded. The XML Signature includes the VSP signer certificate,
    so the server can verify that the verification code originated from the VSP.</p>
