abstract:
  content: "\t <t>MIME is a method of packaging and labeling aggregations of data;
    itis used both for email and the Web. Many usage scenarios wouldbenefit by having
    an objective method of assessing the validity ofMIME data, based on an authenticated
    identity. MIMEAUTH leveragestechnology developed for DKIM to provide such a method.
    Its use canbe extended to cover specific header-fields of a containing emailmessage
    or World Wide Web HTTP content. Existing authenticationmechanisms have achieved
    only limited success due to challenges withadministration and use. MIMEAUTH has
    very low administration and useoverhead, through self-certifying keys in the DNS
    and a labelingmethod that can be transparent to end-users. For relayed andmediated
    sequences, MIMEAUTH can be implemented within a service andtherefore can be transparent
    to end-system software.</p>"
