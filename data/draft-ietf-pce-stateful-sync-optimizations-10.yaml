abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the
    information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) but
    also the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its computation.
    The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state information allows the PCE to compute
    constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their interactions. This
    requires a State Synchronization mechanism between the PCE and the network, the
    PCE and Path Computation Clients (PCCs), and cooperating PCEs. The basic mechanism
    for State Synchronization is part of the stateful PCE specification. This document
    presents motivations for optimizations to the base State Synchronization procedure
    and specifies the required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    extensions.</p>"
