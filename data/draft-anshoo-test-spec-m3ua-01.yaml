abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the test specification for M3UA (MTP3 User Adaptation)
    protocol (RFC 3332), which can be used to test M3UA implementations for conformance
    to the protocol definition. The list of test is exhaustive and covers almost all
    the categories of test. This draft can also be used in conjunction with M3UA specification
    by implementers of protocol as implementers guide, as the pictorial representation
    of various scenarios help easy understanding of the protocol. Next revision of
    the draft will cover the additions done to the protocol revision and any subsequent
    RFC published by IETF.</p>"
