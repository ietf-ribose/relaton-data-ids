abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>As the Internet grows, it becomes inevitable even for the general
    \nusers to take measures against the security risks such as tapping, \nunauthorized
    access, and so on. For example, we can consider the use \ncase of networked home
    appliances which cannot have the rich \ncalculation resources and may use the
    dedicated transport protocol \nfor the media session. In such a case, it is effective
    to connect \nsuch devices securely using IPsec [1] because it does not require
    the \nrich resources, and is independent of the upper layer protocol. Also \nfrom
    the viewpoint of implementation, IPsec is not only widespread in \nIPv4, but also
    mandatory in IPv6 which is expected in the networked \nhome appliances region(this
    use case is just the one of examples, and \nthis document does not focus only
    on home appliances but also on the \ngeneral applications which use the dedicated
    media protocols, where \nIPsec is suitable as the security protocol). \n\n\t </p>\n
