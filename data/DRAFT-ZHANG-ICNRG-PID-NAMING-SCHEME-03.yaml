abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable\n
    \  object or entity with a name, such as a named data chunk, a device,\n   or
    a service end.  Different from host-centric connectivity, ICN\n   connects named
    entities using name-based routing and forwarding.  At\n   the same time, network
    entities, end devices, and applications have\n   variant demands to verify the
    integrity and authenticity of these\n   entities through names.  This document
    proposes a generic naming\n   schema called PID, which supports trust provenance,
    content lookup,\n   routing, and inter-domain resolution for ICN.  With PID schema,
    a\n   name consists of three components: principal(s), identifier(s), and\n   domain(s).
    \ In this draft, we only illustrate the principle and\n   concept of PID and the
    functional role of each component, and leave\n   encoding approaches as implementation
    options.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
