abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual
    links\n   using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  AERO interfaces\n
    \  use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the\n   IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding.\n   Prefix delegation/registration
    services are employed for network\n   admission and to manage the routing system.
    \ Multilink operation,\n   mobility management, quality of service (QoS) signaling
    and route\n   optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache\n
    \  updates.  Standard IP multicasting services are also supported.  AERO\n   is
    a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service especially\n   well-suited
    to aviation services, mobile Virtual Private Networks\n   (VPNs) and many other
    applications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
