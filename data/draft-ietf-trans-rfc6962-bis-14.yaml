abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence
    of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued or observed,
    in a manner that allows anyone to audit certification authority (CA) activity
    and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate
    logs themselves. The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates
    that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates
    to the logs. Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations
    for submissions and queries that are defined in this document.</p>"
