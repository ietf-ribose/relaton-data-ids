abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle low
    power and lossy networks. Automobiles are already equipped with several sensors
    and devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for controlling, monitoring and
    entertainment, etc. For the future in- vehicle networks, the shift to wireless
    is desirable due to heavy weight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able
    to efficiently install devices. However, with the limitation of low power, in-
    vehicle network still requires reliability and scalability in nature of the rolls
    of ECU. The routing protocol should support the features of low-power, high-reliability,
    Subnetting, QoS, Mobility, etc. This document briefly explains the in-vehicle
    networks and ECUs, then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in-
    vehicle networks.</p>"
