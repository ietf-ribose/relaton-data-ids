abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle lowpower
    and lossy networks. Automobiles are already equipped withseveral sensors and devices
    named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) forcontrolling, monitoring and entertainment,
    etc. For the future in-vehicle networks, the shift to wireless is desirable due
    to heavyweight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able to efficientlyinstall
    devices. However, with the limitation of low power, in-vehicle network still requires
    reliability and scalability in natureof the rolls of ECU. The routing protocol
    should support thefeatures of low-power, high-reliability, Subnetting, QoS, Mobility,etc.
    This document briefly explains the in-vehicle networks andECUs, then discusses
    the requirements for the future wireless in-vehicle networks.</p>"
