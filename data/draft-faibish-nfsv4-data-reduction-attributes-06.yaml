abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to add new RECOMMENDED
    attributes to be used in the protocol to provide information about the data reduction
    properties of files. The new data reduction attributes are proposed to allow the
    client application to communicate to the NFSv4 server data reduction attributes
    associated with files and directories using new metadata, communicated to the
    Block Storage data reduction engines. Corresponding new RECOMMENDED attributes
    are proposed to allow clients and client applications to query the server for
    data reduction attributes support and allow to get and set data reduction attributes
    on files and directories. Such data reduction metadata is used as hints to the
    file server about what type of data reduction to apply. The proposed data reduction
    attributes include achievable ratios for compression and deduplication plus whether
    each data reduction technique applies to a file or directory.</p>"
