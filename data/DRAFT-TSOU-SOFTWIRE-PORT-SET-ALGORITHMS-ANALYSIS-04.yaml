abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo analyzes some port set definition algorithms used
    for\n   stateless IPv4 to IPv6 transition technologies.  The transition\n   technologies
    using port set algorithms can be divided into two\n   categories: fully stateless
    approach and binding approach.  Some\n   algorithms can work for both approaches.\n\n\t
