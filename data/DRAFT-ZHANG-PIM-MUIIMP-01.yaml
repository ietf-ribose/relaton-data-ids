abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>       In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1]
    and\n       subsequently  updated  in  [2],  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple\n
    \      upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The\n       MUIIMP
    inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends\n       with multiple
    upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each\n       upstream interface
    of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to\n       the same data simultaneously.\n\n\n\n
    \   \n\t </p>\n      "
