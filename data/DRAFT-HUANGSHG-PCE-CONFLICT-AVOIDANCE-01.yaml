abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a PCE based link state conflict avoidance\n
    \  mechanism.  Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute a network path\n   or
    route based on the information stored in Traffic Engineering\n   Database (TED)
    and TED collects the link resources information\n   through the OSPF-TE protocol.
    \ The proposed conflict avoidance\n   mechanism gives each link two state which
    respectively represents the\n   resource in this link is changed or not.  The
    extended OSPF-TE\n   protocol will also flood the link state information when
    it floods\n   the link resources information.  PCE will add the link state to
    the\n   calculated path when it returns the calculated path to Path\n   Computation
    Clients (PCC).  When the RSVP-TE protocol reserves the\n   resource along the
    calculated path, it will compare the link state\n   stored in the calculated path
    with the link state stored in the\n   local.  If the link state between the calculated
    path and the local\n   is inconsistent then the RSVP-TE protocol will stop the
    resource\n   reservation process, release the reserved resource and promote the\n
    \  OSPF-TE protocol to flood the Link resources information immediately.\n\n\t
