abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of
    \n  devices that implement traffic control based on classification such \n  as
    diff-serv code point (DSCP) criteria.  The methodology is to be \n  applied to
    measurements made on the data plane to evaluate the \n  performance of the traffic
    control mechanisms.  The methodology \n  permits the specific traffic control
    mechanisms and configuration \n  commands to vary between DUTs.  The methodology
    provides procedures \n  using existing Terminology to benchmark DUT performance
    traffic \n  control mechanisms applied to physical and logical interfaces using
    \n  DSCP as the classification criteria. This includes scenarios where \n  Forwarding
    Congestion occurs due to interface congestion.\n\t </p>\n      "
