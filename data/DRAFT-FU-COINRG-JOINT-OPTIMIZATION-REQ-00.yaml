abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the development of edge computing, there is a trend that\n
    \  computing is widely deployed in network rather than at other end of\n   network,
    and provides services at nearer location.  With the deep\n   integration of network,
    traditional optimization and scheduling\n   within network domain is not enough,
    the endpoint of the path matters\n   a lot.  So the relationship between computing
    and network are new and\n   important topics to be studied.  This document focus
    on the\n   requirements of computing and network joint optimization and\n   scheduling
    based on the newly arising service requirements.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
