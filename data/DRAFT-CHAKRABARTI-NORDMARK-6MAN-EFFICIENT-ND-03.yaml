abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed
    for\n   neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address\n   autoconfiguration,
    router advertisement and solicitation.  With the\n   progress of Internet adoption
    on various industries including home,\n   wireless, M2M and cellular networks
    there is a desire for optimizing\n   the legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol.
    \ This document describes\n   a method of optimization by reducing multicast messages
    and\n   introducing an IPv6 address Registration mechanism.  The optimization\n
    \  of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for Wirless and low-\n   power
    IPv6 networks and as well as Data Centers and Home Networks.\n   The solution
    is capable of handling existing legacy IPv6 nodes in the\n   network with local
    mobility.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
