abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>It is quite common that application developers and system architects\nare
    in need for authentication and authorization support in a\ndistributed environment.
    \ At least three parties need to cooperate,\nnamely the end host, the identity
    provider, and the relying party.\nAt the end of the exchange the identity provider
    asserts identity\ninformation or certain attributes to the relying party without\nexposing
    the user's long-term secret to the relying party.\n\nAlthough the problem sounds
    challenging and interesting, it is not\nnew.  In fact, various IETF groups have
    produced specifications to\nsolve this problem, such as Kerberos, RADIUS, and
    Diameter.  Outside\nthe IETF various Single-Sign-On solution for HTTP-based applications\nhave
    been developed as well.\n\nThe reader might therefore wonder about the need for
    new work given\nthe existence of readily available solutions.  This document tries
    to\nanswer this question in a compact fashion.  Note that the description\nin
    this document focuses on the scope of the new work as part of the\n\"Federated
    Authentication Beyond The Web\" BOF being proposed rather\nthan what could be
    theoretically done.\n\t </p>\n      "
