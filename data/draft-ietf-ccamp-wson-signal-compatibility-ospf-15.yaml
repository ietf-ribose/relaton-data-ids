abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
    Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing enhancements to support signal compatibility
    constraints associated with Wavelength- Switched Optical network (WSON) elements.
    These routing enhancements are applicable in common optical or hybrid electro-optical
    networks where not all of the optical signals in the network are compatible with
    all network elements participating in the network. This compatibility constraint
    model is applicable to common optical or hybrid electro optical systems such as
    Optical-Electronic-Optical (OEO) switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters
    since such systems can be limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.</p>"
