abstract:
- content: "<p>LRDD (pronounced 'lard') provides a process for obtaining information
    about a resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The 'information
    about a resource' - a resource descriptor - provides machine-readable information
    that aims to increase interoperability and enhance interactions with the resource.
    LRDD provides a narrow and well-defined set of rules for obtaining and processing
    link-based descriptors (found in multiple sources such as HTTP headers, document
    markup, and resource descriptors) which are often required for security and consistent
    client behavior.</p>"
