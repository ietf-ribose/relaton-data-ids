abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes two methods for producing an integrity
    check\n   value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an\n
    \  integrity check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair.  This behavior\n   is
    needed for such operations as creating the signature of a PKCS #10\n   certification
    request.  These algorithms are designed to provide a\n   proof-of-possession rather
    than general purpose signing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
