abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be used
    to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional LSP. When an
    associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path
    as its forward LSP. This document updates the Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined
    in RFC 4090 to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated
    bidirectional LSPs. This document also updates the procedure for associating two
    reverse LSPs defined in RFC 7551 to support co-routed bidirectional LSPs. The
    FRR procedures can ensure that for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed
    paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure event.</p>"
