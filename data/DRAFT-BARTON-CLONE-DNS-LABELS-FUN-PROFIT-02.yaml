abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a method for making one or more Domain
    Name\n   System (DNS) labels behave in the DNS \"as if\" they were actually an\n
    \  entirely different label.  E.g., the delegee for the example.org zone\n   could
    define bar.example.org to be a CLONE of foo.example.org.  This\n   method is designed
    to meet the needs of those managing\n   Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) zones
    that have been determined\n   to be semantically similar, and therefore should
    be treated \"as if\"\n   they were identical.  This method can also be used more
    generally to\n   handle situations where either CNAME or DNAME Resource Records
    are\n   currently being used.\n\n   A key design goal for the CLONE method is
    that all of the semantic\n   benefits are available by updating only the authoritative
    servers for\n   the zone.  Domain managers who want to support DNSSEC for the
    CLONEd\n   labels/zones may do so with dynamic signing of the CLONEs, or rely
    on\n   users being behind a CLONE-Aware resolving name server.\n\nForeword\n\n
    \  [RFC Editor, please remove this Section at publication time.\n   Thanks.]\n\n
    \  This is my first draft, please be gentle. :) I'm definitely open to\n   the
    possibility that there are better ways to accomplish the concepts\n   presented
    herein.  I'm sure that there are a non-zero number of\n   errors in the formatting,
    references, etc.  Also Sections 2 and 3 may\n   be under-specified, unclear, or
    unworkable.  So please don't be\n   afraid to offer (constructive) criticism.\n\n
    \  TODO:\n\n      Update/add/improve references?\n\n      Add/improve examples?\n\n
