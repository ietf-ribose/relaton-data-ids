abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP). TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet stack, and
    has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. In this
    time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793,
    though these are only documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects
    and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.
    This document obsoletes RFC 793 and several other RFCs (TODO: list actual RFCs).</p>"
