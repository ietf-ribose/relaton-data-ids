abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy\n
    \  implications of different types of \"numeric identifiers\" used in IETF\n   protocols,
    and tries to categorize them based on their\n   interoperability requirements
    and the associated failure severity\n   when such requirements are not met.  Subsequently,
    it provides advice\n   on possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy
    the\n   interoperability requirements of each identifier category, while\n   minimizing
    the security and privacy implications, thus providing\n   guidance to protocol
    designers and protocol implementers.  Finally,\n   this describes a number of
    algorithms that have been employed in real\n   implementations to generate transient
    numeric identifiers and\n   analyzes their security and privacy properties.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
