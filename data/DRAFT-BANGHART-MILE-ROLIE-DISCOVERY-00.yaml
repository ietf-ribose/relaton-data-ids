abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a mechanism that allows consistent
    discovery\n   of ROLIE repositories.  This discovery is extremely important for\n
    \  automated tools that cannot use out-of-band Service Document\n   discovery.
    \ Any human operators are also able to use this mechanism\n   to avoid relying
    on inconsistent human to human communication.  This\n   document updates the ROLIE
    core specification.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
