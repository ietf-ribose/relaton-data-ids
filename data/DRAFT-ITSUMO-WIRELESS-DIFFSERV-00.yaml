abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This   document  presents   a  QoS   architecture   framework
    \ with\npreliminary protocol specifications for next generation wireless IP\nnetworks.
    The  architecture is based on  differentiated services in\nthat traffic are aggregated
    and forwarded in backbone network based\non per  hop behaviors.  In the proposed
    \ architecture, there  is at\nleast  one   global  server  and   several  local
    \ nodes   in  each\nadministration domain. The server is  referred to as the QoS
    Global\nServer (or QGS), and local nodes are referred to as QoS local nodes\n(or
    \ QLN).   QLNs  are  ingress  nodes of  the  DS  (Differentiated\nService)  domain.
    \  They reside  generally  in  the  edge of  wired\nbackbone networks.  The QGS
    retains  the global information  of the\ndomain, and  informs QLNs  what to do
    \ when traffic comes  in.  The\nmobile station (MS) has the  QoS signaling with
    QGS only.  Once the\nQoS signaling is done, the QGS updates the QoS profile in
    each QLN.\nThe MS  is then free to  move within the same  domain without other\nQoS
    signaling.  The actual traffic generated by MS goes through QLN\nonly.  The QGS
    is in control plane and QLNs are in transport plane.\nBy  retaining   the  global
    \ information  in   central  server  and\nseparating  control and  transport,
    the  architecture  is flexible,\neasy  to   add  new  services,   and  more  efficient
    \  for  mobile\nenvironment.\n\t </p>\n      "
