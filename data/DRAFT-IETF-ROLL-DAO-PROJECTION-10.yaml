abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document enables a RPL Root to install and maintain Projected\n
    \  Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of nodes that may or\n   may
    not include self, for a chosen duration.  This potentially\n   enables routes
    that are more optimized or resilient than those\n   obtained with the classical
    distributed operation of RPL, either in\n   terms of the size of a source-route
    header or in terms of path\n   length, which impacts both the latency and the
    packet delivery ratio.\n   Projected Routes may be installed in either Storing
    and Non-Storing\n   Modes Instances of the classical RPL operation, resulting
    in\n   potentially hybrid situations where the mode of some Projected Routes\n
    \  is different from that of the other routes in the RPL Instance.\n\n\t </p>\n
