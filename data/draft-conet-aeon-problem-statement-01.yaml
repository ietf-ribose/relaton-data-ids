abstract:
- content: "<p>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
    many application providers and network operators. They often rely on these capabilities
    to deploy and/or support a wide range of applications. These applications generate
    flows that may have specific connectivity requirements that can be met if made
    known to the network. Historically, this functionality has been implemented to
    the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect and infer flow characteristics.
    Heuristics may be based on port ranges, network separation (e.g. subnets or VLANs,
    Deep Flow Inspection (DFI), or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). But many application
    flows in current usages are dynamic, adaptive, time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer,
    asymmetric, used on multipurpose devices, and have different priorities depending
    on direction of flow, user preferences, and other factors. Any combination of
    these properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and may result
    in compromises to application security or user privacy.</p>"
