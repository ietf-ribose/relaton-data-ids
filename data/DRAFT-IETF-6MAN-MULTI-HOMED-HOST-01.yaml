abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a network
    that\n   has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that\n
    \  implements BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple\n   routers
    to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as\n   the usage of stateful
    firewalls that effectively act as address-based\n   filters.\n\n   This host behavior
    may interact with source address selection in a\n   given implementation, but
    logically follows it.  Given that the\n   network or host is, or appears to be,
    multihomed with multiple\n   provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected
    to use a\n   source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all\n   neighboring
    routers are advertising that prefix in their Router\n   Advertisement Prefix Information
    Options, this document specifies to\n   which router a host should present its
    transmission.  It updates RFC\n   4861.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
