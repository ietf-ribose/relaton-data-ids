abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware\n
    \  internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes\n   the
    properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and provides\n   for endpoints
    and applications to use these properties to select\n   paths through the Internet
    for their traffic.  This document poses\n   questions in path-aware networking
    open as of 2019, that must be\n   answered in the design, development, and deployment
    of path-aware\n   intetnetworks.  It was originally written to frame discussions
    in the\n   Path Aware Networking proposed Research Group (PANRG), and has been\n
    \  published to snapshot current thinking in this space.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
