abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC)\n   framework, which provides header compression and fragmentation\n   functionality.
    \ SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area\n   Networks (LPWAN).\n\n   SCHC
    compression is based on a common static context stored in LPWAN\n   devices and
    in the network.  This document applies SCHC compression\n   to IPv6/UDP headers.
    \ This document also specifies a fragmentation\n   and reassembly mechanism that
    is used to support the IPv6 MTU\n   requirement over LPWAN technologies.  Fragmentation
    is mandatory for\n   IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has
    not been\n   possible to apply such compression, still exceed the layer two\n
    \  maximum payload size.\n\n   The SCHC header compression mechanism is independent
    of the specific\n   LPWAN technology over which it will be used.  Note that this
    document\n   defines generic functionality.  This document purposefully offers\n
    \  flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices,\n   that
    are expected to be made in other, technology-specific,\n   documents.\n\n\t </p>\n
