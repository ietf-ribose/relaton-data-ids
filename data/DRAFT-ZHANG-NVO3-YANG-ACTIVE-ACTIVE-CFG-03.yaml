abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When a Tenant System is not collocated with Network Virtualization\n
    \  Edges (NVEs), it's possible for this Tenant System to connect to a\n   group
    of NVEs or a single NVE with multiple underlay IP addresses to\n   use the active-active
    multihoming L2/L3 service provided by these\n   NVEs.\n\n   This document defines
    the YANG data model that can be used to\n   configure NVEs of a NVO3 network to
    achieve active-active multi-\n   homing.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
