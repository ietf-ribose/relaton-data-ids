abstract:
- content: "<p>Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
    currently learn the mapping between MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and their
    egress TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or by
    the TRILL ESADI (End-Station Address Distribution Information) protocol. When
    an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame for a destination address (MAC&amp;Label)
    that the switch does not know, the data frame is flooded within the frame's Data
    Label across the TRILL campus. This document describes the framework for using
    directory services to assist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination
    frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND (Address Resolution
    Protocol / Neighbor Discovery), thus improving TRILL network scalability and security.</p>"
