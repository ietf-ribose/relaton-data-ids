abstract:
  content: "<p>In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
    diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for the use of
    non-ASCII characters in RFCs. While English remains the accepted language of the
    Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be in UTF-8. This document describes
    the RFC Editor requirements and guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters
    in RFCs. This document updates the RFC Style Guide [I-D.iab-styleguide]. Please
    review the PDF or HTML versions of this draft to see the full text, examples,
    and references.</p>"
