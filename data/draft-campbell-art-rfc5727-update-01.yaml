abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5727 defines several processes for the Real-time Applications and
    Infrastructure (RAI) area. These processes include the evolution of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related protocols, as well as the operation of the
    DISPATCH and SIPCORE working groups. This document updates RFC 5727 to allow flexibility
    for the area and working group structure, while preserving the SIP change processes.
    It also generalizes the DISPATCH working group processes so that they can be easily
    adopted by other working groups.</p>"
