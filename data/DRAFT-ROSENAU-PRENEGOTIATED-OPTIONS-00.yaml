abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In many cases (example: PPTP [RFC2637]) a data transfer between
    two\n   hosts is initiated by using \"generic\" protocols (in the case of PPTP\n
    \  this is UDP) and later on \"special\" protocols (in the case of PPTP\n   this
    is GRE) are used.\n\n   The drawback in this case is that the IANA has to assign
    protcol\n   numbers (in the case of GRE this is 47)\n\n   The same is true for
    TCP header \"options\" and ICMP packet \"types\".\n\n   To avoid assigning numbers
    by the IANA this document proposes to\n   reserve a range of protocol numbers
    for \"negotiation\" instead.\n   During the phase using \"generic\" protocols
    the two hosts negotiate a\n   protocol number in that range.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
