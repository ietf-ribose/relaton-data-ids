abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between
    a client\n   running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host\n
    \  that has opted-in to communications from that code.  Since it\n   requires
    one TCP connection for every WebSocket connection, having\n   multiple WebSocket
    connections between the same client and the same\n   server is inefficient.  On
    the other hand, HTTP/2.0 specifies a fast,\n   secure, multiplexed framing protocol.
    \ This document provides bi-\n   directional multiplexed communication by layering
    WebSocket on top of\n   HTTP/2.0.\n\n   Please send feedback to the ietf-http-wg@w3.org
    mailing list.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
