abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for how a client discovers its local network's NAT64
    prefix (RFC7050) defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but
    in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations section that specification indicates
    that the name actually has no particularly special properties would require special
    handling, and does not request IANA to record the name in the Special-Use Domain
    Names registry. Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of
    the name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain Names registry
    as a name with special properties. This document describes the special treatment
    required, formally declares the special properties of the name, adds similar declarations
    for the corresponding reverse mapping names, and updates RFC7050.</p>"
