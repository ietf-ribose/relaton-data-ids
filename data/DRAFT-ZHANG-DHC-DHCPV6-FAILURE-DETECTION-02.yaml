abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In DHCPv6 failover or other multiple servers deployment scenarios,
    an\n   automatic failure detection capability may be desirable.  This\n   document
    describes a detection method, with which the secondary\n   server can detect the
    link failure between the primary server and\n   clients.  This document does not
    define any protocol details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
