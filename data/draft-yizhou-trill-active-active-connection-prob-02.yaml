abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid failover for both unicast
    and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology between TRILL
    switches. Active-active at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics
    to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational
    document discusses the high level problems and goals when providing active-active
    connection at the TRILL edge.</p>"
