abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a pilot implementation of a protocol
    change\n   within the IETF.  The essence of the change is to have workgroup\n
    \  chairs handle the feedback of AD (Area Director) Evaluation comments\n   on
    a draft to the authors (and workgroup if necessary) and make sure\n   that needed
    draft changes are made, and the AD notified when a new\n   draft which resolves
    the comments is available.\n\t </p>\n      "
