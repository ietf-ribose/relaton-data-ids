  content: "\n\t <p>This document introduces a dynamic secondary routing structure
    with\nthe destination address and subnet mask as the first index and DSCP\nvalue
    as the second. DSCP values of various applications are\nextracted and packets
    are forwarded in accordance with them.\nTherefore, applications with different
    demands of Quality of Service\n(QoS) can be served accordingly, which can promote
    the quality of\ntransmission and finally achieve differentiated services.\n\t
