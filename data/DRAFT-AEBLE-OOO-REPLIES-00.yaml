    modern\nInformation Technology. It is often considered business critical.\nMost
    current email systems have means for automated replies to\nincoming messages.
    These are mostly used for so-called out-of-office\nreplies or OoO-replies for
    short.\nThis document discusses problems of out-of-office replies and\nsuggests
    best practices and controls that should be put in place.\n\t </p>\n      "
