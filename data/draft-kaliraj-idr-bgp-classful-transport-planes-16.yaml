abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Service Mapping"
    to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes satisfying a certain
    SLA using BGP. The document describes a framework for classifying underlay routes
    into transport classes and mapping service routes to specific transport class.
    The "Transport class" construct maps to a desired SLA and can be used to realize
    the "Topology Slice" in 5G Network slicing architecture. This document specifies
    BGP protocol procedures that enable dissemination of such service mapping information
    that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be
    administetered by the same provider or by closely co-ordinating provider networks.
    A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for this purpose
    that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding. This new address
    family is called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT. BGP CT makes it possible
    to advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus avoiding need
    of multiple loopbacks on the egress node. It carries transport prefixes across
    tunnel domain boundaries (e.g. in Inter-AS Option-C networks), which is parallel
    to BGP LU (SAFI 4) . It disseminates "Transport class" information for the transport
    prefixes across the participating domains, which is not possible with BGP LU.
    This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled network.
    Though BGP CT family is used only in the option-C inter-AS neworks, the Service
    Mapping procedures described in this document apply in the same manner to Intra-AS
    service end points as well as Inter-AS option-A, option-B and option-C variations.</p>
