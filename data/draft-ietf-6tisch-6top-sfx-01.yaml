abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a Scheduling Function called "Experimental Scheduling
    Function" (SFX). SFX dynamically adapts the number of scheduled cells between
    neighbor nodes, based on the amount of currently allocated cells and the neighbor
    nodes' cell requirements. Neighbor nodes negotiate in a distributed neighbor-to-neighbor
    basis the number of cell(s) to be added/deleted. SFX uses the 6P signaling messages
    to add/delete cells in the schedule. This function selects the candidate cells
    from the schedule, defines which cells will be added/deleted and triggers the
    allocation/deallocation process.</p>
