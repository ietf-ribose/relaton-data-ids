abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The concepts in this document are based on work onQ.Flowstatesig
    in the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signalinghas been worked on in the ITU for
    the past 13 years. However,this document stands on its own since no IETF compatible
    formathas yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide(1) a technique
    to have network nodes provide available rateflows (like TCP) rapid and periodic
    feedback to the sender as tothe maximum rate they should send and (2) to provide
    networkfeedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak ratethey require
    can be statistically assured. Network traffic usingthis protocol should experience
    reduced response time, lessqueuing delay and less packet discards. The use of
    this protocolis limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and is to beconverted
    to and from standard IP flows at the subnetboundaries.</p>"
