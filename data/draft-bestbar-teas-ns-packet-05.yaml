abstract:
  content: "<p>Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
    into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and functions so
    that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or customers. Network slices
    need to operate in parallel while providing slice elasticity in terms of network
    resource allocation. The Differentiated Service (Diffserv) model allows for carrying
    multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying on compliant
    nodes to apply specific forwarding treatment (scheduling and drop policy) on to
    packets that carry the respective Diffserv code point. This document adopts the
    Diffserv principles and proposes a scalable approach to realize network slicing
    in IP/MPLS networks. The solution does not mandate Diffserv to be enabled in the
    network to provide a specific forwarding treatment, but can co- exist with and
    complement it when enabled.</p>"
