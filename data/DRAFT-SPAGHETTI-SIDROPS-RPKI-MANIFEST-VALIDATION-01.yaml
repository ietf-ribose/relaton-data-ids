abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Manifests are a critical cornerstone to the global Resource
    Public\n   Key Infrastructure (RPKI).\n\n   RFC 6486 describes a validation decision
    tree which introduced the\n   notion of 'local policy', creating space for ambiguity.
    \ This\n   ambiguity has led to various RPKI implementations producing different\n
    \  output when presented with the same input, but also leads to severe\n   operational
    security implications.\n\n   This document updates RFC 6486 and introduces the
    notion of a default\n   policy for Manifest validation to encourage harmony between\n
    \  implementations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
