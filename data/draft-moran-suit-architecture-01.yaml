abstract:
- content: "<p>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
    need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for
    constrained devices. Incorporating such update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities,
    to update configuration settings as well as adding new functionality is recommended
    by security experts. This document lists requirements and describes an architecture
    for a firmware update mechanism suitable for IoT devices. The architecture is
    agnostic to the transport of the firmware images and associated meta-data. This
    version of the document assumes asymmetric cryptography and a public key infrastructure.
    Future versions may also describe a symmetric key approach for very constrained
    devices.</p>"
