    the rathervague language in 822bis in a way which preserves compatibilitywith
    the largest possible subset of existing mail user agents. This document should
    be read in conjunction with Jacob Palme'sMail-Followup-To proposal (draft-ietf-drums-mail-followup-to-00.txt),which
    the working group chair, Jacob Palme and the author regard as anatural complement
    of this proposal.</p>"
