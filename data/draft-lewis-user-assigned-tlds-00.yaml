abstract:
- content: "<p>The practice governing the delegation of ASCII two-letter domain names
    in the DNS root zone is to follow the ISO 3166-1 standard?s alpha 2 codes. This
    standard is maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency. Contained within the
    gamut of ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 codes is a set of values designated as User Assigned.
    This document recommends that values designated as user assigned be reserved from
    delegation in the root zone. A specific range of these codes is assigned expressly
    for private-use.</p>"
