abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP. This framework
    includes how to discover the need for transcoding services in a session and how
    to invoke those transcoding services. Two models for transcoding services invocation
    are discussed: the conference bridge model and the third-party call control model.
    Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation
    to support deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-impaired individuals. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
