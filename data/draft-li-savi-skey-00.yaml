abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a mechanism to provide source addressvalidation
    for IPv6 networks using a shared key (Skey) signatureapproach. The basic idea
    is that a device generates a signatureusing a shared key and its IP address and
    then the signature is sentto a validating device for source address validation.
    The proposedmechanism is intended to complement ingress filtering techniques witha
    finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.</p>"
