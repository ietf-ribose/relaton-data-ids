abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations
    it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers).
    \ In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an
    intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification defines
    a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host
    to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using
    the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in that it allows
    a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t
