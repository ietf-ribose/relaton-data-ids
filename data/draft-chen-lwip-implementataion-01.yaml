abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Since small devices such as sensors are often required to bephysically
    small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internetprotocols will have to
    deal with having limited computing resourcesand memory. This report describes
    the design and implementation of asmall TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small
    enough to be used inminimal systems.</p>"
