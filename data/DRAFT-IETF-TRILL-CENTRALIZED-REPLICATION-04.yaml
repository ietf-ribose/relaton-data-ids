abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue
    may\n   occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [RFC7781] is used. This\n   draft
    describes a solution to resolve the RPF check failure issue\n   through centralized
    replication. All ingress RBridges send BUM\n   (Broadcast, Unknown unicast and
    Mutlicast) traffic to a centralized\n   node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.
    When the centralized node\n   receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets
    and forwards\n   them to all destination RBridges using a distribution tree\n
    \  established as per TRILL base protocol[RFC6325]. To avoid RPF check\n   failure
    on a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge and the\n   centralized replication
    node, some change of RPF calculation\n   algorithm is required. RPF calculation
    on each RBridge should use\n   the centralized node as ingress RB instead of the
    real ingress\n   RBridge which is denoted as RBv in [RFC7781] to perform the\n
    \  calculation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
