abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing\n   information
    about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is\n   currently in production usage
    by a number of equipment vendors and\n   carriers and this document is submitted
    to request the registration\n   of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also
    be used in some\n   situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN\n
    \  interconnection.\n\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the Internet Draft will
    be the last\n   with this name, as the SIPPING Working Group no longer exists.
    \ The\n   next version of this Internet Draft will be through the DISPATCH\n   Working
    Group and will be draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info-00.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
