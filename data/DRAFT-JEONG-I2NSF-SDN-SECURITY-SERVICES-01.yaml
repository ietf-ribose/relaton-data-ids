abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides requirements for security services based
    on\n   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with two representative use cases:\n
    \  (i) centralized firewall system and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack\n   mitigation
    system.  For the centralized firewall system, this\n   document raises challenging
    issues in existing firewalls and proposes\n   a solution for such challenges with
    a use case of the centralized\n   firewall system based on SDN.  For the centralized
    DDoS-attack\n   mitigation system, this document also raises challenging issues
    in\n   existing DDoS-attack mitigation techniques and proposes a solution\n   for
    such challenges with a use case of the centralized DDoS-attack\n   mitigation
    system based on SDN.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
