abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    It is very common that implementers of HTTP severs require
    the ability\n    to associate an identifier to an HTTP request and or response,
    this can\n    be for a number of reasons which could include checking for duplicate\n
    \   requests, allowing the caller of an API to maintain a record of their\n    interaction
    with the server or to track client/server requests through\n    a disparate system
    of services. In any case, the implementer will quite\n    often use a custom HTTP
    header and either assign a value itself or\n    require the caller to supply the
    value. This document outlines a\n    consistent storage mechanism for this identifier
    by way of a standard\n    HTTP header and a new status code for when a mandated
    identifier is\n    omitted. The purpose is to create better consistency for clients
    of\n    third-party HTTP servers and HTTP based APIs by introducing this\n    standard
    request and response header.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
