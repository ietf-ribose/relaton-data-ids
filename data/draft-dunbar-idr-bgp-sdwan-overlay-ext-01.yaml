abstract:
- content: <p>The document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise
    a SD-WAN edge node's capabilities in establishing SD-WAN overlay tunnels with
    other SD-WAN nodes through third party untrusted networks. The goal is for SD-WAN
    network to scale, enabling SD-WAN overlay tunnels among large number of SD-WAN
    nodes to be established with few provisioning needed. A "SD-WAN" tunnel refers
    to a point-to-point IPsec overlay path between two end-points that can aggregate
    multiple different types of underlay networks. An "end-point" is referring to
    a port on a SD- WAN node throughout this document. This document specifies new
    sub-TLVs for the SD-WAN Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.</p>
