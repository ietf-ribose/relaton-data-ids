abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Cryptographically Generated Addresses as defined for IPv6 Secure\nNeighbor
    Discovery are generated locally on the host using the CGA.\nHowever, it can be
    desireable for other systems to be involved in the\ngeneration and use of CGAs
    in a number of ways: offloading the heavy\ncryptography for generating or validating
    CGAs, proxy-generation of\nCGAs for hosts that don't support the CGA-related protocols\nthemselves
    or registration of CGA addresses for the purposes of\ncentral address administration.
    \ When additional hosts are involved\nin aspects of CGA, it's necessary to discover
    these other hosts\nand/or additional configuration items such as the Sec value.
    \ The\nDHCPv6 is a natural choice for doing this.  This document provides an\noverview
    of the opportunities and issues in this area.\n\t </p>\n      "
