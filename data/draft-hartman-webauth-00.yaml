abstract:
- content: "<p>It is often useful to be able to use distributed identity--an identity
    from one organization for accessing resources from another. for example it would
    be useful to use an identifier corresponding to your work identity when accessing
    business partners' websites. Similarly collaborative projects can benefit from
    distributed identity. This memo proposes a scheme for distributed identity that
    meets requirements to minimize the risk of phishing attacks for HTTP- based applications
    including websites.</p>"
