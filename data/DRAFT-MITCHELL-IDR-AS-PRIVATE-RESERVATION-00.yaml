abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System
    numbers\n   (ASNs) that may be used within networks but should not be advertised\n
    \  to the Internet, known as private use ASNs.  This document enlarges\n   the
    total space available for private use ASNs by documenting the\n   reservation
    of a second larger range and updates RFC 1930.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
