abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol\nDiet
    EXchange (HIP DEX).  HIP DEX is a variant of the HIP Base\nEXchange (HIP BEX)
    [RFC5201-bis] specifically designed to use as few\ncrypto primitives as possible
    yet still deliver the same class of\nsecurity features as HIP BEX.\n\nThe design
    goal of HIP DEX is to be usable by sensor devices that are\nmemory and processor
    constrained.  Like HIP BEX it is expected to be\nused together with another suitable
    security protocol, such as the\nEncapsulated Security Payload (ESP).  HIP DEX
    can also be used\ndirectly as a keying mechanism for a MAC layer security protocol
    as\nis supported by IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE.802-15-4.2006].\n\t </p>\n      "
