abstract:
- content: <p>This document aims to illustrate possible approaches to make network
    management and operations more autonomic in several aspects. The ultimate goal
    is that the network could run all by itself, so that users and administrators
    may feel that there is no network to take care of at all (a.k.a. "Networkless").
    The approaches are described in a form of different levels (inspired by the Self-Driven
    Car levels). The higher the level is, the more autonomic management capabilities
    the network would have. Although some specific technologies are categorized into
    different levels, it is not the document's intent to rank them; rather, this document
    is more about discussing the possible next stage and the ultimate vision. Hopefully,
    this document could collect people's consensus in the industry and provide guidance
    for future technology developments.</p>
