abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Spurious retransmission timeouts (RTOs) cause suboptimal TCPperformance,
    because they often result in unnecessary retransmissionof the last window of data.
    This document describes the 'Forward RTORecovery' (F-RTO) algorithm for detecting
    spurious TCP RTOs. F-RTO isa TCP sender only algorithm that does not require any
    TCP options tooperate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segmenttriggered
    by an RTO, the F-RTO algorithm at a TCP sender monitors theincoming acknowledgements
    to determine whether the timeout wasspurious and to decide whether to send new
    segments or retransmitunacknowledged segments. The algorithm effectively helps
    to avoidadditional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCPperformance
    in case of a spurious timeout.</p>"
