abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition] provides a definition\n
    \  of the route leak problem, and also enumerates several types of route\n   leaks.
    \ This document first examines which of those route-leak types\n   are detected
    and mitigated by the existing origin validation (OV)\n   [RFC 6811].  It is recognized
    that OV offers a limited detection and\n   mitigation capability against route
    leaks.  This document specifies\n   enhancements that significantly extend the
    route-leak prevention,\n   detection, and mitigation capabilities of BGP.  One
    solution\n   component involves carrying a per-hop route-leak protection (RLP)\n
    \  field in BGP updates.  The RLP field is proposed be carried in a new\n   optional
    transitive attribute, called BGP RLP attribute.  The\n   solution is meant to
    be initially implemented as an enhancement of\n   BGP without requiring BGPsec
    [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].\n   However, when BGPsec is deployed in the future,
    the solution can be\n   incorporated in BGPsec, enabling cryptographic protection
    for the RLP\n   field.  That would be one way of implementing the proposed solution\n
    \  in a secure way.  The document also includes a stopgap method for\n   detection
    and mitigation of route leaks for an intermediate phase\n   when OV is deployed
    but BGP protocol on the wire is unchanged.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
