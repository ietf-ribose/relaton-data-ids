abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide additional guidance to operators
    of end-systems, operators of networks, and researchers beyond that provided in
    [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id] and [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled] in order to
    ensure successful deployment of L4S [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4s-arch] in the Internet.
    The focus of this document is on potential interactions between L4S flows and
    Classic ECN ([RFC3168]) flows in Classic ECN bottleneck links. The document discusses
    the potential outcomes of these interactions, describes mechanisms to detect the
    presence of [RFC3168] bottlenecks, and identifies opportunites to prevent and/or
    detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks.</p>"
