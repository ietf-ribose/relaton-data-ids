abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a centralized DF Designated Forwarder
    election\n   mechanism to be used between an SDN (Software Defined Network)\n
    \  controller and each PE (Provider Edge) device in an EVPN network.\n   Such
    a mechanism overcomes some issues with the current standalone DF\n   election
    defined in RFC 7432. A new BGP capability and an additional\n   DF Election Result
    Route Type are specified to support this\n   centralized DF election mechanism.\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
