abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enables a RPL Root to install and maintain Projected
    Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of nodes that may or may not include
    self, for a chosen duration. This potentially enables routes that are more optimized
    or resilient than those obtained with the classical distributed operation of RPL,
    either in terms of the size of a source-route header or in terms of path length,
    which impacts both the latency and the packet delivery ratio. Projected Routes
    may be installed in either Storing and Non-Storing Modes Instances of the classical
    RPL operation, resulting in potentially hybrid situations where the mode of some
    Projected Routes is different from that of the other routes in the RPL Instance.</p>"
