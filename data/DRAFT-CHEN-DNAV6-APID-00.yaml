abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an IPv6 network attachment detection
    \n   mechanism in which access routers disseminate the identifiers of on-\n   link
    access points reported by hosts.  By caching the identifiers, \n   hosts assess
    the likelihood of an L3 link change right after an \n   access point change.  The
    hosts are hence able to quickly determine \n   whether an existing IP address
    configuration can be reused or a new \n   one should be acquired.  The mechanism
    aims to achieve fast L3 \n   connectivity re-establishment with less signaling
    overhead. \n\t </p>\n      "
