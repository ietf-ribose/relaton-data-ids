abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The RADIUS over TLS experiment described in RFC 6614 has opened\n
    \  RADIUS to new use cases where the 4096-octet maximum RADIUS packet\n   proves
    problematic.  This specification extends the RADIUS over TCP\n   experiment to
    permit larger RADIUS packets.  This specification\n   compliments other ongoing
    work to permit fragmentation of RADIUS\n   authorization information.\n\n\t </p>\n
