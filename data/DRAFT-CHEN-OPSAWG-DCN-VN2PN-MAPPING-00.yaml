  content: "\n\t <p>   Cloud tenant needs virtual network to interconnect their VMs
    on\n   server. In order to effectively and efficiently map virtual network\n   to
    physical network, certain mechanism should be employed.\n\n   This memo analysis
    the existing VN2PN mapping technique employed in\n   DataCenter and point out
    the potential shortcomings lie in it. This\n   memo also try to provide a generic
    mechanism to facilitate the VN2PN\n   mapping in DataCenter network.\n\n\t </p>\n
