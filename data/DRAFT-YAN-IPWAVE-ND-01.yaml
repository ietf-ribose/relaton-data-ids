abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For C-ACC, platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, direct
    IP\n   communication between neighbor vehicles poses the following two\n   issues:
    1) how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the demanded\n   service; and 2) how
    to discover the link-layer address of the\n   neighbor vehicle and selected server.
    \ This draft presents a solution\n   to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].\n\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
