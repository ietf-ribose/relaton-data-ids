abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a mechanism to solve an existing issue
    with\n   Longest Prefix Match (LPM), that exists where an operator domain is\n
    \  divided into multiple areas or levels where summarization is\n   utilized.
    \ This draft addresses a fail-over issue related to a multi\n   areas or levels
    domain, where a link or node down event occurs\n   resulting in an LPM component
    prefix being omitted from the FIB\n   resulting in black hole sink of routing
    and connectivity loss.  This\n   draft introduces a new control plane convergence
    signaling mechanism\n   using a negative prefix called Prefix Unreachable Announcement
    (PUA),\n   utilized to detect a link or node down event and signal the RIB that\n
    \  the event has occurred to force immediate control plane convergence.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
