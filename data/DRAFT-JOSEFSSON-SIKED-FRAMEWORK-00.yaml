abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The debate over whether to store cryptographic keys used by\napplications
    in the Domain Name System or not has been going on for\nsome time.  There are
    arguments for and against [6].  This document\ntries to take a step further and
    provides some initial terminology,\nproblem statement and use cases for storing
    application keys in DNS,\nin order to enable more substantiated input to the discussion.
    \ We\nmention some proposed solutions so far.  We also give some\nrequirements
    on a solution (be it DNS based or not) that would\nsatisfy the use cases.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
