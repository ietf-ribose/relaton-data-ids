abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections
    \ \ncontrolled either by GMPLS (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by  \nManagement
    System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently  \ncoexist, the ability
    of transforming an existing PC into a SPC and  \nvice versa - without actually
    affecting Data Plane traffic being  \ncarried over it - is a valuable option.
    This applies especially when  \na GMPLS based Control Plane is first introduced
    into an existing  \nnetwork and there may be the need, from a Carrier point of
    view, to  \npass under GMPLS control existing connections already set up over
    \ \nData Plane. In other terms, such operation could be seen as a way of  \ntransferring
    the ownership and control of an existing and in-use Data \nPlane connection between
    the Management Plane and the Control Plane,  \nleaving its Data Plane state untouched.
    \ \nThis memo provides a minor extension to GRSVP-TE signaling protocol,  \nwithin
    GMPLS architecture, to enable such connection ownership  \ntransfer and describes
    the proposed procedures.  \n  \n\n\n\n  \nConventions used in this document  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",  \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].\n\t </p>\n      "
