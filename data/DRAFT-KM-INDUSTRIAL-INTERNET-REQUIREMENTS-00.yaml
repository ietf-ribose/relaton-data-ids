abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Industry Control Networks host a diverse set of non-internet\n
    \  protocols for different purposes.  Even though they operate in a\n   controlled
    environment, one end of industrial control applications\n   run over internet
    technologies (IT) and another over operational\n   technology (OT) protocols.
    \ This memo discusses the challenges and\n   requirements relating to converegence
    of OT and IT networks.  One\n   particular problem in convergence is figuring
    out reachability\n   between the these networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
