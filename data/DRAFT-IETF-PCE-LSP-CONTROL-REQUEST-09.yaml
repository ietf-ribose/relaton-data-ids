abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information
    about\n   the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n   Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  When a PCE has stateful\n   control over LSPs
    it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify\n   the attributes (especially
    the paths) of the LSPs.  A Path\n   Computation Client (PCC) has set up LSPs under
    local configuration\n   may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE.\n\n
    \  There are use-cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain\n   control
    of locally configured LSPs of which it is aware but that have\n   not been delegated
    to the PCE.\n\n   This document describes an extension to the Path Computation
    Element\n   communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make such requests.\n\n\t
