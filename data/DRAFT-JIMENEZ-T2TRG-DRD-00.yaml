abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   NB: This document was submitted in 2013 and then discontinued.
    \ It is\n   now submitted to T2TRG for discussion on the replication of the\n
    \  Resource Directory.  References and many operations would need\n   updating.
    \ Architecture and functions should remain the same.\n\n   In some M2M scenarios,
    it is convenient to offer non-centralized\n   alternatives for discovery and rendezvous.
    \ This document defines a\n   Distributed Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained
    Application\n   Protocol (CoAP).  Distribution is achieved by means of a structured\n
    \  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay.  The DHT-based P2P overlay provides\n   discovery,
    rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points as\n   well as HTTP proxy
    service for Web clients.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
