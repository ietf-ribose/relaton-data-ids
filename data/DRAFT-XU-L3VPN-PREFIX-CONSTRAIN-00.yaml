abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines MP-BGP procedures that allow BGP speakers
    to\n   exchange VPN route interest information.  This information can be\n   used
    to control VPN route distribution at the granularity of address\n   prefix, which
    is applicable in the context of Virtual Subnet and may\n   also be applicable
    in other BGP/MPLS IP VPN environments.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
