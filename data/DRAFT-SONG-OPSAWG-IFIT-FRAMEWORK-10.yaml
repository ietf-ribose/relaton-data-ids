abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As networks increase in scale and network operations become
    more\n   sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance\n
    \  (OAM) methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques,\n   running
    in active and passive modes, become more susceptible to\n   measurement accuracy
    and misconfiguration errors.  With the advent of\n   programmable data-plane,
    emerging on-path telemetry techniques\n   provide unprecedented flow insight and
    realtime notification of\n   network issues.\n\n   This document enumerates the
    key deployment challenges for flow-\n   oriented on-path telemetry techniques,
    especially in carrier operator\n   networks.  To address these issues, a high-level
    framework, In-situ\n   Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT), is outlined. iFIT includes
    several\n   essential functional components that can be materialized and\n   assembled
    to implement a complete solution for on-path telemetry.\n\n   This informational
    document aims to clarify the problem domain, and\n   summarize the best practices
    and sensible system design\n   considerations.  The iFIT framework helps to guide
    the analysis on\n   the current standard status and gaps, and motivate new works
    to\n   complete the ecosystem.  It also helps to inspire innovative network\n
    \  telemetry applications supporting advanced network operations.  As a\n   reference
    and open framework, iFIT does not specify the\n   implementation of the components
    and the interfaces between the\n   components.  The compliance with iFIT framework
    is not mandatory for\n   telemetry applications either.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
