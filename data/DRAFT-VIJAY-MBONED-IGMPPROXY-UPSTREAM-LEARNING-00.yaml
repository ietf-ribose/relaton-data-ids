abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   This document specifies a mechanism for the dynamic determination
    of\n   the upstream interface of a device running IGMP/MLD Proxy, as opposed\n
    \  to manual configuration.  The learning of the upstream interface is\n   achieved
    by listening for IGMP/MLD General Query messages on the\n   interfaces of the
    proxy device.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
