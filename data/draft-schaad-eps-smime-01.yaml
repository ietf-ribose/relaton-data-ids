abstract:
- content: "<p>When using the Email Policy Service model, there exist the communications
    with the policy server which are based in XML and there are the communications
    which are S/MIME based and thus done in ASN.1. This document covers the ASN.1
    requirements and the modifications in S/MIME processing needed to implement an
    Email Policy Service system.</p>"
