abstract:
- content: "<p>A darknet is a set of routable but unused IP addresses whose monitoring
    is an effective way of detecting malicious activities on the Internet. We have
    developed an alert system - called DAEDALUS - based-on a large-scale distributed
    darknet that consists of several organizations that mutually observe the malicious
    packets transmitted from the inside of the organizations. This draft shares the
    schema of an alert of the DAEDALUS to exchange incident information among organizations.</p>"
