abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Recording of a conversation presents a possible breach of privacy.\n
    \  This document presents a use of the SIP Preconditions Framework to\n   negotiate
    the recording guidelines for the session.  One party may\n   assert either their
    desire to record or their restriction of the\n   other party's recording.  In
    order to establish the session, the\n   other party must respond that it agrees
    to the conditions.  While\n   this does not have the power to limit the physical
    recording by the\n   user on the end system, it provides evidence of the expressed
    wishes\n   of one party and the agreement of the other.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
