abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A number of TCP enhancements in diverse fields as congestion
    control,\n   loss recovery or side-band signaling could be improved by allowing\n
    \  both ends of a TCP session to interpret the value carried in the\n   Timestamp
    option.  Further enhancements are enabled by changing the\n   receiver side processing
    of timestamps in the presence of Selective\n   Acknowledgements.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC1323 and specifies a backward-compatible\n   method for negotiating
    for additional capabilities for the Timestamp\n   option, and lists a number of
    benefits and drawbacks of this\n   approach.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
