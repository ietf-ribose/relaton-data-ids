abstract:
- content: "<p>A use case describing transmission of an application on the Internet
    that has several unique characteristics of Augmented Reality (AR) applications
    is presented for the consideration of the Media Operations (MOPS) Working Group.
    One key requirement identified is that the Adaptive-Bit-Rate (ABR) algorithms'
    current usage of policies based on heuristics and models is inadequate for AR
    applications running on the Edge Computing infrastructure.</p>"
