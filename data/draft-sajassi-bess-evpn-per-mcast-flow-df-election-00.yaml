abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder (DF) at
    the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of VLANs in case
    of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service). However, the current level of granularity
    of per-VLAN is not adequate for some of applications. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ac-df]
    and [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election] improves base line DF election. This document
    is an extension to HRW base drafts ([I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-ac-df] and [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election])
    and further enhances HRW algorithm to do DF election at the granularity of (ESI,
    VLAN, Mcast flow).</p>"
