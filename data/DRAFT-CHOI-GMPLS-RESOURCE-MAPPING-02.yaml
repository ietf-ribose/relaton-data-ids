abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The new forms of label used in GMPLS to deal with the widening
    scope \nof MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to\nas
    a 'Generalized Label' related to resource. In this draft, we\ndescribe the relationship
    of labels and resources. We also describe\nthe resource mapping methods for GMPLS
    with heterogeneous interfaces.\nParticularly we present the methods for resource
    mapping at incoming\nand outgoing switching interface where data flows with label
    of a\ndifferent granularity are aggregated into the data flow of large\nbandwidth.\n\t
