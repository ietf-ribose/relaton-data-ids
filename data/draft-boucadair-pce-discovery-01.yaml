abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a simple mechanism that ease discovery of remote
    Autonomous Systems (AS) supporting inter-domain MPLS-based constrained tunnels
    service (this service is also denoted by Path Computation Service (PCSv)) thanks
    to the use of Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Remote ASs could be managed by
    a single or distinct Internet Network Providers (INP). Particularly, this draft
    describes how Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to announce Path Computation
    Service unique identifiers across the Internet in order for other PCEs to be able
    to discover a path towards every AS supporting this Path Computation Service.</p>"
