abstract:
- content: <p>With PIM-Bidir, the RPA does not have to be associated with a router.
    Rather, it only needs to be a routable address on a RPL (typically a multi-access
    network). Such a scenario is commonly referred as Phantom RPA. This achieves RP
    resiliency to some extent, because the "RP" will not fail. However, if the RPL
    itself partitions, traffic converged to one partition will not be able to reach
    other parts of the network where joins converge to the other partitions of the
    RPL. This document proposes simple procedures, which does not require signaling
    extensions, to achieve RPL resiliency.</p>
