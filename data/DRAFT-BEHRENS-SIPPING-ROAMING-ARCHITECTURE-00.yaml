abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>           This draft describes an authentication mechanism which
    can \n           be used to enable users of VoIP to globally roam between any
    \n           number of ITSPs (Internet Telephony Service Providers) \n           without
    needing to have a prior customer or billing \n           relationship with all
    of them. This enables profiles and one- \n           line-billing. \n           Providers
    using this authentication mechanism do neither \n           need full-mesh \n
    \          trust relationships or roaming agreements with every other \n           possible
    provider nor do they need to rely on a centralized \n           brokerage entity
    to process calls. \n           The Home Network (HN), which handles all AAA for
    a user \n           attempting to use an ITSP's service is determined through
    a \n           unique identifier submitted by the user. This Network Access \n
    \          Identifier [RFC2486] contains information about the trust \n           domain
    or trust realm the user belongs to. Based on a simple \n           discovery mechanism
    a provider can establish a trust path to \n           this home network. Once
    this is \n           established, the provider can authenticate the user and \n
    \          check his credit with the home network. Accounting and rate \n           information
    will be sent to the home network for mediation \n           and processing. \n\t
