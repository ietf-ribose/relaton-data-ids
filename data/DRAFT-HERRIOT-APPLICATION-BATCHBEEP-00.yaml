abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Application/BatchBeep content-type, like the Multipart/Related\ncontent-type,
    provides a mechanism for representing objects that\nconsist of multiple components.
    \ An Application/BatchBeep entity\ncontains the wire representation of the client-to-server
    part of a\nBEEP (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) session, which consists
    of\nsequence of frames. Each frame contains a message or a part of a\nmessage.
    Each message (other than channel 0 messages) represents a\ncomponent of the compound
    object, just as a body part of a\nMultipart/Related entity represents a component.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
