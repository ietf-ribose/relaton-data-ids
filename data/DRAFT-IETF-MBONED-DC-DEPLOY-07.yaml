abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The volume and importance of one-to-many traffic patterns in
    data\n   centers is likely to increase significantly in the future.  Reasons\n
    \  for this increase are discussed and then attention is paid to the\n   manner
    in which this traffic pattern may be judiously handled in data\n   centers.  The
    intuitive solution of deploying conventional IP\n   multicast within data centers
    is explored and evaluated.  Thereafter,\n   a number of emerging innovative approaches
    are described before a\n   number of recommendations are made.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
