abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component
    capable\n   of selecting paths through a traffic engineering network.  These\n
    \  paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may\n   be
    unsolicited requests issued by the PCE to network elements.  Both\n   approaches
    use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the\n   details of the computed
    path.\n\n   Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\n   Specifications\".
    \ RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification and\n   describes how Flow Specification
    Components are used to describe\n   traffic flows.  RFC 8955 also defines how
    Flow Specifications may be\n   distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows
    to be associated\n   with routes.\n\n   RFC XXXX specifies a set of extensions
    to PCEP to support\n   dissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE
    to indicate\n   what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.\n\n
    \  The extensions defined in this document extends the support for\n   Ethernet
    Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN)\n   traffic filtering
    rules either by themselves or in conjunction with\n   L3 flowspecs.\n\n   RFC
    Editor Note: Please replace XXXX in the Abstract with the RFC\n   number assigned
    to draft-ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec when it is published.\n   Please remove this note.\n\n\t
