abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity
    trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency
    Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss are becoming key requirements for path computation
    along with other constraints and metrics. These metrics are associated with the
    Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers. The Link
    Bandwidth Utilization (the total bandwidth of a link in current use for the forwarding)
    is another important factor to consider during path computation. IGP Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Metric extensions describes mechanisms with which network performance information
    is distributed via OSPF and IS-IS respectively. The Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform
    path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This
    document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency Variation,
    Packet Loss, and Link Bandwidth Utilization as constraints for end to end path
    computation.</p>"
