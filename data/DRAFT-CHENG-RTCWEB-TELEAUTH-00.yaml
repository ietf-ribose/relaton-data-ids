abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p> The WebRTC use-cases and related requirements are defined in\n
    \  [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] that contains browser to\n   browser
    use-cases and browser-GW/server use-cases (e.g., telephony\n   terminal). In the
    use-case of telephony terminal, it is necessary for\n   telephony terminal to
    be able to attest his identity to the telephony\n   operator. Unlike the current
    authentication specified in\n   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security] such as PKI based
    authentication and web\n   based peer authentication WebRTC communication is directly
    controlled\n   by the telephony operator, which poses new authentication methods,\n
    \  including re-using existence authentication mechanism of telephony\n   operator
    and authentication by using web credentials. This document\n   presents the security
    authentication of WebRTC communication for\n   telephony terminal.\n\n\t </p>\n
