abstract:
  content: "<p>The forwarding performance of an IP router is highly dependent on theinformation
    in its forwarding information base. This document describesthe methodology to
    be used to determine the IP packet forwardingperformance of an IP router as a
    function of the routers ability toproperly form and optimize its forwarding information
    base.</p>"
