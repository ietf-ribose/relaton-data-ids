abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes implications of applying end-to-end\n
    \  encryption at the transport layer.  It identifies in-network uses of\n   transport
    layer header information.  It then reviews the implications\n   of developing
    end-to-end transport protocols that use authentication\n   to protect the integrity
    of transport information or encryption to\n   provide confidentiality of the transport
    protocol header and expected\n   implications of transport protocol design and
    network operation.\n   Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact
    of network\n   characteristics have been important to the design of current\n
    \  transport protocols, it also considers the impact on transport and\n   application
    evolution.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
