abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Several technologies such as Traffic Engineering (TE), Service\n
    \  Function Chaining (SFC), and policy based routing are used to steer\n   traffic
    through a specific, user-defined path.  This document defines\n   mechanisms to
    securely prove that traffic transited a defined path.\n   These mechanisms allow
    to securely verify whether, within a given\n   path, all packets traversed all
    the nodes that they are supposed to\n   visit.  This document specifies a data
    model to enable these\n   mechanisms using YANG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
