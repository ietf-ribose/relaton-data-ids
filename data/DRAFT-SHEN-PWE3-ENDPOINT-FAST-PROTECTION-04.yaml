abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires\n
    \  (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment\n   circuit
    failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE\n   failure, and multi-segment
    PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the\n   basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy,
    upstream label assignment and\n   context specific label switching, the mechanism
    enables local repair\n   to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure.
    \ In\n   particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of\n
    \  milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a\n   pre-established
    bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can reduce\n   traffic loss before global
    repair reacts to the failure and the\n   network converges on the topology changes
    due to the failure.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
