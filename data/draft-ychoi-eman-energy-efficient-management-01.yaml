abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless network devices which have limited resources (e.g., power
    supply, memory, computing capabilities, and so on) should consider energy-efficient
    management. However, the existing network architectures for the network devices
    have some problems on energy management about device failures and errors. To improve
    the energy management problem, this document proposes energy-efficient management
    framework for the network devices.</p>"
