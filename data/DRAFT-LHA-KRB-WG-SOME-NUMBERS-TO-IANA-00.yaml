abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Kerberos have many registers where only some have been registered,\nthis
    document tries to cover the rest of them.  There is a private\nspace but that
    can not be used for implementation in released\nsoftware.  Also private is not
    avaible for all types.  This document\nmoves control over the numbers to an IANA
    number registerty.\n\t </p>\n      "
