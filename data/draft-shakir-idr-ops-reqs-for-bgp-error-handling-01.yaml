abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System routingprotocol
    in modern IP networks. The failure modes as defined by theoriginal protocol standards
    are based on a number of assumptionsaround the impact of session failure. Numerous
    incidents both in theglobal Internet routing table and within Service Provider
    networkshave been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATEmessage
    causing large-scale failures in one or more AutonomousSystems.This memo describes
    the current use of BGP-4 within Service Providernetworks, and outlines a set of
    requirements for further work toenhance the mechanisms available to a BGP-4 implementation
    whenerroneous data is detected. Whilst this document does not providespecification
    of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a setof enhancements to BGP-4
    to improve the protocol's robustness to suitits current deployment.</p>"
