abstract:
  content: "<p>Part of the charter of the Protocol Design Group of the HTTP-NG project
    is toidentify a set of formal interfaces that will allow the current functionality
    ofthe Web to be captured, as well as support future needs. Before delving into
    thespecific interfaces, the kinds of concepts involved need to be described. Theactual
    interface descriptions here are cast in terms of distributed objectsystems, the
    merits of which as a foundation for the Web have been discussed in'Migrating the
    Web toward Distributed Objects'(ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/webilu.html)
    and elsewhere. The intent isnot to imply that what is presented here is complete
    or final, but rather toprovide a starting point for how the Web should look in
    the future.</p>"
