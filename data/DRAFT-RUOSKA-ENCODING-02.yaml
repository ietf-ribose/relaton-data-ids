abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding\n
    \  format called the Ruoska Encoding (RSK).  The main design goals are\n   minimal
    resource usage, well defined structured with good selection\n   of widely known
    data types, and still extendable for future usage.\n\n   The main benefit when
    compared to non binary hierarchically\n   structured formats like XML is simplicity
    and minimal resource\n   demands.  Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming\n
    \  operation.\n\n   When compared to other binary formats like encoding formats
    of ASN.1\n   the main benefit is simplicity.  ASN.1 with different encondings
    is\n   complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of effort.\n\n\t </p>\n
