abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a central policy controlling network-based\nmobility
    management solution through Authentication, Authorization,\nAccounting (AAA),
    and policy controller interactions between Proxy\nMobile IPv6 entities(both Mobile
    Access Gateway and Local Mobility\nAnchor) under an AAA server and policy server
    group within a Proxy\nMobile IPv6 Domain. The AAA and policy interactions are
    not only used\nto download and update mobile node specific user data information\nbetween
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities and a remote policy store, but\nalso update the local
    mobility anchor about the current location of\nthe mobile node instead of signaling
    messages between the mobile\naccess gateway and local mobility anchor.\n\t </p>\n
