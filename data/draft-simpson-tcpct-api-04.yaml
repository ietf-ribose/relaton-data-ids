abstract:
  content: "\t <t>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of |connections
    and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder(server) state during the
    initial handshake. The Initiator (client)has sole responsibility for ensuring
    required delays betweenconnections. The cookie exchange may carry data, limited
    to inhibitamplification and reflection denial of service attacks.This document
    provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API)to support \"basic\" and
    \"advanced\" TCPCT applications. TCP/IPapplications written using the sockets
    API have enjoyed a high degreeof portability.Copyright NoticeCopyright (c) 2011
