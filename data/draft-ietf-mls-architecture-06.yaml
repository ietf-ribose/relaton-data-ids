abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol [MLSPROTO] document has
    the role of defining a Group Key Agreement, all the necessary cryptographic operations,
    and serialization/deserialization functions necessary to create a scalable and
    secure group messaging protocol. The MLS protocol is meant to protect against
    eavesdropping, tampering, message forgery, and provide good properties such as
    forward-secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) in the case of past or
    future device compromises. This document, on the other hand is intended to describe
    a general secure group messaging infrastructure and its security goals. It provides
    guidance on building a group messaging system and discusses security and privacy
    tradeoffs offered by multiple security mechanism that are part of the MLS protocol
    (ie. frequency of public encryption key rotation). The document also extends the
    guidance to parts of the infrastructure that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol
    document and left to the application or the infrastructure architects to design.
    While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow in order
    to interoperate at the protocol level, most will vastly influence the overall
    security guarantees that are achieved by the overall messaging system. This is
    especially true in case of active adversaries that are able to compromise clients,
    the delivery service or the authentication service.</p>"
