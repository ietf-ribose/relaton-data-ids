abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets\n
    \  encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4\n   service
    continuity.  A number of differing functional approaches have\n   been developed
    for this, each having their own specific\n   characteristics.  As these approaches
    share a similar functional\n   architecture and use the same data plane mechanisms,
    this memo\n   describes a specification whereby a single CPE can interwork with
    all\n   of the standardized and proposed approaches to providing encapsulated\n
    \  IPv4 in IPv6 services.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
