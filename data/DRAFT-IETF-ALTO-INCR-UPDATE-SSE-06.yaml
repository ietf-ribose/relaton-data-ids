abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285]
    protocol\n   provides network related information, called network information\n
    \  resources, to client applications so that clients can make informed\n   decisions
    in utilizing network resources.  For example, an ALTO\n   server can provide network
    and cost maps so that an ALTO client can\n   use the maps to determine the costs
    between endpoints when choosing\n   communicating endpoints.\n\n   However, the
    ALTO protocol does not define a mechanism to allow an\n   ALTO client to obtain
    updates to the information resources, other\n   than by periodically re-fetching
    them.  Because some information\n   resources (e.g., the aforementioned maps)
    may be large (potentially\n   tens of megabytes), and because only parts of the
    information\n   resources may change frequently (e.g., only some entries in a
    cost\n   map), complete re-fetching can be extremely inefficient.\n\n   This document
    presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO server to push\n   updates to ALTO clients,
    to achieve two benefits: (1) Updates can be\n   immediate, in that the server
    can send updates as soon as they are\n   available; and (2) Updates are incremental,
    in that if only a small\n   section of an information resource changes, the server
    can send just\n   the changes.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
