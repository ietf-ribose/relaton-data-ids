abstract:
- content: "<p>Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
    used by television stations available for secondary use as a result of the switch
    from analog to digital. The spectrum in such cases is still owned by the primary
    user to whom it is licensed. However parts of the spectrum may be unused at a
    given location or time and hence can be made available for secondary use. In order
    to use such spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list
    of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time. This document
    specifies protocol elements that can be used to query a white space database and
    obtain a response by a device.</p>"
