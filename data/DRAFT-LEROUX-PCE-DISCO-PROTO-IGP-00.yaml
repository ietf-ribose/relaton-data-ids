abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In various situations it would be highly useful for a Path
    \n   Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically \n   discover
    a set of Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), along with some \n   of information
    relevant for PCE selection. When the PCE is an LSR \n   participating to the IGP,
    or even a server participating passively to \n   the IGP, a simple and efficient
    way for PCE discovery, consists of \n   relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose
    this document defines \n   simple OSPF and ISIS extensions for the advertisement
    of PCE \n   Discovery information within and across IGP areas.  \n\t </p>\n      "
