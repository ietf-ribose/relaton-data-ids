abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Source route based Extensible IP Network(EIPv4) implementation
    can\n   efficiently resolve the problem of IP address shortage. It is\n   necessary
    to provide domain name service in EIPv4 to make it suitable\n   for practical
    application. Here provides a way to DNS extension for\n   EIPv4. It discusses
    how to extend the architecture of DNS into\n   two-level extensible IP network
    architecture to provide query between\n   domain name and IP node position denotation.
    And a new DNS RR type\n   has been defined for this purpose.\n   \n\n\t </p>\n
