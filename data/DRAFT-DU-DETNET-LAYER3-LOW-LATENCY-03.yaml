abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   It is complex to support deterministic forwarding in a large
    scale\n   network because there is too much dynamic traffic in the network and\n
    \  the data model becomes hard to predict after aggregation in the\n   intermediate
    nodes.  This document introduces the problem of micro-\n   bursts in layer3 network,
    and proposed a method to decrease the\n   micro-bursts in layer3 network for low-latency
    traffic.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
