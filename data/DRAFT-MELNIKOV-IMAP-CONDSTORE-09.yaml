abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Often, multiple IMAP clients need to coordinate changes to a common\nIMAP
    mailbox.  Examples include different clients for the same user,\nand multiple
    users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients\nneed a mechanism to synchronize
    state changes for messages within the\nmailbox. They must be able to guarantee
    that only one client can change\nmessage state (e.g., message flags or annotations)
    at any time.  An\nexample of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox as
    a message\nqueue with multiple dequeueing clients.\nThe Conditional Store facility
    provides a protected update mechanism for\nmessage state information that can
    detect and resolve conflicts between\nmultiple writers.\n\t </p>\n      "
