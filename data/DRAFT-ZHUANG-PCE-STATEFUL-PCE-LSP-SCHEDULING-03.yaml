abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes a set of extensions needed to the stateful\n
    \  Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as\n   to
    enable Labeled Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation\n   and LSP
    setup/deletion based on the actual network resource usage\n   duration of a traffic
    service in a centralized network environment.\n   A scheduled LSP can be setup
    at its starting time and deleted after\n   its usage duration such that LSPs for
    the other traffic services can\n   take over these network resources beyond that
    period.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
