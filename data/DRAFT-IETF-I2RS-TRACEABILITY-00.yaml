abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a framework for traceability in the
    Interface\n   to the Routing System (I2RS) and information model for that\n   framework.
    \ It specifies the motivation, requirements, use cases, and\n   defines an information
    model for recording interactions between\n   elements implementing the I2RS protocol.
    \ This framework provides a\n   consistent tracing interface for components implementing
    the I2RS\n   architecture to record what was done, by which component, and when.\n
    \  It aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be\n   used
    for troubleshooting, auditing, forensics, and accounting\n   purposes.\n\n\t </p>\n
