abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>During the last year  several attempts have been made to provide
    a \ngeneralized framing mechanism for protocols using TCP. The main pur-\npose
    of those mechanisms is to enable hardware network adapter \nbuilders to discover
    fast the next Upper Layer Protocol Data Unit \nboundary and thus minimize the
    amount of memory required on the \nnetwork adapters in order to handle packet
    drop or reordering in the \nnetwork.\n\t </p>\n      "
