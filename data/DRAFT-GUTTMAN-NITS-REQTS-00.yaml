abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Networks in the Small (NITS) are a particular class of networks.\nThese
    networks may be established in the home, in small offices or\neven on an impromptu
    basis.  NITS networks typically do not have and\nshould not be expected to have
    network infrastructure such as DHCP\nservers, DNS and the like.  These networks
    may have only occasional\nconnectivity to larger networks where these services
    exist.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
