abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The increase in the use of different access networks which involves
    \ndifferent mechanisms for authentication and access authorizations, \ndemands
    the new mechanisms to roam at any time anywhere with low \nlatency. To overcome
    this process we need new mechanisms where a user \nterminal roams in different
    access networks with low latency and \n \n \n efficiently. There is a need for
    unified signaling mechanisms for \nchoosing and accessing networks. \n\nIn this
    draft we have discussed some of the processes involved in \nnetwork selection,
    mobility management, security management in detailed \nto perform handover. The
    Handover information is passed to home server \nusing the new handover method
    using EAP proposed vice versa in this \ndraft. Even though there are different
    mechanisms provide this support \nsuch as IAPP context transfer mechanisms for
    seamless mobility some of \nthe instances like supporting different access networks,
    roaming in \naccess networks etc is not considered. The proposed mechanism is
    \ninteroperable with the existing procedures involving security \nauthentication
    and mobility during roaming.\n\t </p>\n      "
