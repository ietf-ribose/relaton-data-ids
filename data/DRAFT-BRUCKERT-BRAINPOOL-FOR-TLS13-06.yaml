abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   ECC Brainpool curves were an option for authentication and
    key\n   exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2,\n
    \  but were deprecated by the IETF for use with TLS version 1.3 because\n   they
    had little usage.  However, these curves have not been shown to\n   have significant
    cryptographical weaknesses, and there is some\n   interest in using several of
    these curves in TLS 1.3.\n\n   This document provides the necessary protocol mechanisms
    for using\n   ECC Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3.  This approach is not endorsed
    by\n   the IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
