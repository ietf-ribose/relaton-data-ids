abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol-independent method that employs
    two bits to allow endpoints to signal packet loss in a way that can be used by
    network devices to measure and locate the source of the loss. The signaling method
    applies to all protocols with a protocol- specific way to identify packet loss.
    The method is especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport
    header and do not allow an alternative method for loss detection.</p>"
