abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the existing inadequacies in the handling
    of\n   security issues within the NFSv4 protocols and the steps that need to\n
    \  be taken to correct the situation, including the preparation of new\n   standards-track
    documents updating existing treatments of NFSv4\n   security.  Because the security
    approach has been and should remain\n   the same for all minor versions, it is
    expected that the basics of\n   security for all the NFSv4 protocols will be addressed
    together in a\n   single NFSv4-wide standards-track document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
