abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.
    \ This\n   openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n
    \  it can allow bad communications as well as good.  Thus, as the\n   Internet
    has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact\n   of abusive or
    illegal communications.  Recently, there has been an\n   increasing emphasis on
    \"blocking\", the active prevention of abusive\n   or illegal communications.
    \ This document examines several technical\n   approaches to Internet service
    blocking in terms of their fit with\n   the overall Internet architecture.  In
    general, the approach to\n   service blocking that is most coherent with the Internet
    architecture\n   is to inform endpoints about bad services, so that the communicants\n
    \  can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
