abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Used in Massive Data Centers (MDCs), BGP-SPF and similar protocols\n
    \  need link neighbor discovery, link encapsulation data, and Layer 2\n   liveness.
    \ The Link State Over Ethernet protocol provides link\n   discovery, exchanges
    supported encapsulations (IPv4, IPv6, ...),\n   discovers encapsulation addresses
    (Layer 3 / MPLS identifiers) over\n   raw Ethernet, and provides layer 2 liveness
    checking.  The interface\n   data are pushed directly to a BGP-LS API, obviating
    the need for\n   centralized controller architectures.  This protocol is intended
    to\n   be more widely applicable to other upper layer routing protocols\n   which
    need link discovery and characterisation.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
