abstract:
- content: "<p>6TiSCH Packet Replication and Elimination mechanism consists in duplicating
    data packets into several paths in the network to increase reliability and provide
    low jitter. Over a wireless medium, this technique can take advantage of communication
    overhearing, when parallel transmissions over two adjacent paths are scheduled.
    This document presents the concept and details the required changes to the current
    specifications that will be necessary to enable this.</p>"
