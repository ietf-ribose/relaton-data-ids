abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined
    since the\n   1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild\n   conformance
    to the specifications.  The malformed messages that\n   result are non-standard.
    \ Nonetheless, decades of experience has\n   shown that handling with some tolerance
    the malformations that result\n   is often an acceptable approach, and is better
    than rejecting the\n   messages outright as nonconformant.  This document includes
    a\n   collection of the best advice available regarding a variety of common\n
    \  malformed mail situations, to be used as implementation guidance.\n\n\t </p>\n
