abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is one of the companion documents which describes
    the\n   infrastructure layer security baseline YANG output for network\n   infrastructure
    devices.  The infrastructure layer security baseline\n   includes all the fundamental
    security capabilities/functions about\n   the device itself, which may also be
    provided by the device to the\n   upper layer applications as a secure environment.
    \ In this particular\n   document, the integrity measurement, cryptography security,
    secure\n   key management, and secure certificate management are summarized to\n
    \  generate the data model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
