abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to encapsulate IPv6 packets over
    the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). The LLDP is a single layer-two protocol
    with its own ethertype. It is never forwarded, which is a desireable property
    when building the IPv6-over-IPsec- over-IPv6-Link-Local tunnels that make up the
    ANIMA Autonomic Control Plane (ACP). This unorthodox encapsulation avoids unwanted
    interactions between the ACP packets and native packet forwarding engines, as
    well as being safe for layer-2 switches which might otherwise have no IPv6 capabilities.</p>"
