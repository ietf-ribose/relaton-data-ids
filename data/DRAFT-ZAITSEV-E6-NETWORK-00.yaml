abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes new E6 addressing scheme for the creation
    of\nworld-wide networks totally constructed on the base of Ethernet\ntechnology.
    Hierarchic E6 addresses with the length of 6 octets are\nused instead of both
    Ethernet MAC-addresses and IP-addresses which\nallows the routing within world-wide
    networks and cuts overhead of\nTCP, IP headers; the address space is extended
    in 16K times regarding\nIP addresses. Standard Ethernet LLC2 facilities are employed
    for\nguaranteed delivery of information. E6 Network Architecture\nsimplifies packets
    processing aglorithms that improves the network\nperformance and QoS.\n\t </p>\n
