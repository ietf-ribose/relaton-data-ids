abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States government has published the NSA Commercial National
    Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies a profile of the Certificate
    Management over CMS (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates
    in applications using the CNSA Suite. It is a refinement of RFCs 5272, 5273, and
    5274. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of
    all components of US National Security Systems that manage X.509 public key certificates
    over CMS. US National Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication
    SP-800-59. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process
    high-value information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and
    operators of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
