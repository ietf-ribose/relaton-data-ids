abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol
    strings\n   need to prepare such strings in order to perform comparison\n   operations
    (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).\n   This document defines
    a framework enabling application protocols to\n   perform the preparation and
    comparison of internationalized strings\n   (a.k.a.  \"PRECIS\") in a way that
    depends on the properties of Unicode\n   code points and thus is agile with respect
    to versions of Unicode.\n   As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable
    approach to\n   the handling of internationalized strings than the previous\n
    \  framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A specification that\n   reuses
    this framework can either directly use the base string classes\n   or subclass
    the base string classes as needed.  This framework takes\n   an approach similar
    to the revised internationalized domain names in\n   applications (IDNA) technology
    (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC\n   5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the
    high-level design goals\n   described in RFC 4690, albeit for application technologies
    other than\n   the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.\n\n\t
