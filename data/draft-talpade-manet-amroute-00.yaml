abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The Adhoc Multicast Routing Protocol (AMRoute) allows for robust
    IPMulticast in mobile adhoc networks by exploiting user-multicast trees anddynamic
    cores. It creates a bidirectional shared-tree for datadistribution using only
    the group senders and receivers as tree nodes.Unicast tunnels are used as the
    tree links to connect neighbors on the'user-multicast tree.' Thus, AMRoute does
    not need to be supported bynetwork nodes that are not interested/capable of multicast,
    and cost isincurred only by group senders and receivers. AMRoute makes certain
    nodes'core nodes' to initiate the signaling component of AMRoute, such asdetection
    of group members and tree setup. Core nodes differ significantlyfrom those in
    CBT and PIM-SM, since they are not a central point for datadistribution and can
    move dynamically among member nodes. Since AMRoute isnot dependent on any specific
    unicast routing protocol, it can operateseamlessly over separate domains with
    different unicast protocols.</p>"
