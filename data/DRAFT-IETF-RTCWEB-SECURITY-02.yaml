abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTC-Web) working group
    is\n   tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications\n   between
    Web browsers.  The major use cases for RTC-Web technology are\n   real-time audio
    and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data\n   transfer.  Unlike most
    conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-\n   based soft phones) RTC-Web communications
    are directly controlled by\n   some Web server, which poses new security challenges.
    \ For instance,\n   a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a
    server to\n   place a video call.  Unrestricted access to such an API would allow\n
    \  any site which a user visited to \"bug\" a user's computer, capturing\n   any
    activity which passed in front of their camera.  This document\n   defines the
    RTC-Web threat model and defines an architecture which\n   provides security within
    that threat model.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
