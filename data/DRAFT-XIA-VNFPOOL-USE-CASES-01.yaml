abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network function appliances such as subscriber termination,\n
    \  firewalls, tunnel switching, intrusion detection, and routing are\n   currently
    provided using dedicated network function hardware.  As\n   network function is
    migrated from dedicated hardware platforms into\n   a virtualized environment,
    a set of use cases with application\n   specific resilience requirements begin
    to emerge.\n\n   These use cases and requirements cover a broad range of capabilities\n
    \  and objectives, which will require detailed investigation and\n   documentation
    in order to identify relevant architecture, protocol\n   and procedure solutions
    to ensure reliance of user services using\n   virtualized functions.\n\n   This
    document provides an analysis of the key reliability\n   requirements for applications
    and functions that may be hosted within\n   a virtualized environment.  These
    NFV engineering requirements are\n   based on a variety of uses cases and goals
    , which include\n   reliability scalability, performance, operation and automation.\n\n
    \  Note that this document is not intended to provide or recommend\n   protocol
    solutions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
