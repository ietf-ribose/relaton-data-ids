abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification
    to RFC\n2598. The primary motivation for this draft is that the definition\nof
    EF PHB given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EF\nPHB, and has
    been determined to be unimplementable in a manner\ncompliant with the definition.
    In particular, no work-conserving\nscheduler, including all of the schedulers
    listed in the\nImplementation Examples section of RFC 2598, can comply with the\ndefinition
    given in that RFC.\nThis draft gives a rigorous definition of EF PHB which in
    our\nopinion preserves the spirit of the EF PHB as intended by RFC 2598\nwhile
    allowing a number of reasonable compliant implementations. The\ndocument also
    provides implementation guidance and lists several\npossible implementation examples
    which conform to the definition\ngiven in this draft.\n\t </p>\n      "
