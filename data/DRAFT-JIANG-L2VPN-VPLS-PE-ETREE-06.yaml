abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which
    uses\n   VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model\n
    \  is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-\n   Tree
    VPLS PEs are interconnected by  PWs which carry the VLAN\n   indicating the E-Tree
    attribute, the MAC address based Ethernet\n   forwarding engine and the PW work
    in the same way as before. A\n   signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and
    VLAN mapping\n   negotiation is further described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
