abstract:
- content: <p>The Designated Forwarder (DF) in EVPN networks is the PE responsible
    for sending multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast traffic to a multi-homed
    CE, on a given Ethernet Tag on a particular Ethernet Segment (ES). The DF is selected
    based on the list of PEs that advertise the Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI)
    to the EVPN network. While PE node or link failures trigger the DF re-election
    for a given &lt;ESI, EVI&gt;, individual Attachment Circuit (AC) or MAC-VRF failures
    do not trigger such DF re-election and the traffic may therefore be permanently
    impacted, even though there is an alternative path. This document improves the
    DF election algorithm so that the AC status can influence the result of the election
    and this type of "logical" failures can be protected too.</p>
