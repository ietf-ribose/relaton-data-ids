abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet community's
    expectations of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with respect to security. It
    is not the intent of this document to define a set of requirements that would
    be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to raise awareness among ISPs of the community's
    expectations, and to provide the community with a framework for discussion of
    security expectations with current and prospective service providers.</p>"
