abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Remote access clients, in particular IPsec-based ones, are heavily\ndeployed
    in enterprise environments.  In many enterprises the\nsecurity policy allows remote-access
    clients to switch to unprotected\noperation when entering the trusted network.
    \ This document specifies\na method that lets a client detect this situation in
    a secure manner,\nwith the help of a security gateway.  We propose a minor extension
    to\nIKEv2 to achieve this goal.\n\t </p>\n      "
