abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy
    proper\n   PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments.  As a\n   result,
    domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications\n   using certificates
    that identify the hosting service, not the hosted\n   domain.  Such deployments
    force end users and peer services to accept\n   a certificate with an improper
    identifier, resulting in obvious\n   security implications.  This document defines
    two methods that make\n   it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity
    checking\n   in non-HTTP application protocols.  While these methods developed
    for\n   use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a\n   Domain
    Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in\n   other non-HTTP
    application protocols.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
