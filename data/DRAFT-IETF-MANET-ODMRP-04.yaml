abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing\nprotocol
    designed for ad-hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is\na mesh-based, rather
    than a conventional tree-based, multicast\nscheme and uses a Forwarding Group
    concept (only a subset of nodes\nforwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding).
    It applies\non-demand procedures to dynamically set up routes and maintain\nmulticast
    group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad-hoc\nwireless networks with mobile
    hosts where bandwidth is limited,\ntopology changes frequently and rapidly, and
    power is constrained.\n\t </p>\n      "
