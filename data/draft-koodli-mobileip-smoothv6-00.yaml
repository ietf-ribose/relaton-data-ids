abstract:
  content: "\t <t>During handover from one access router to another, a wireless mobilenode
    may need to have a certain amount of state information passed fromthe Previous-Router
    to the new one. This document specifies extensionsto Mobile IPv6 which allow additional
    control structures enabling thetransfer of the necessary state during handovers.
    This state transferallows the applications running on the mobile node to operate
    withreduced latency, minimal disruption, and reduced packet loss duringhandovers.</p>"
