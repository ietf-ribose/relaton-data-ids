abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Multihoming to upstream ISPs is a requirement today for most
    networks\n   in the Internet. The most common motivation to multihome is for\n
    \  reliable, non-stop access to the Internet. However, Multihoming\n   creates
    scaling problems for the global routing infrastructure by\n   making route aggregation
    more difficult for multihomed networks.\n   Multihoming also complicates the addressing
    scheme used by the\n   network. Another requirement for multihomed networks is
    the ability\n   to load balance traffic between the multiple links to upstream
    ISPs.\n   This requirement is difficult to fulfill for traffic flow in both\n
    \  directions as the multihomed network has no control over the return\n   path
    of the packet.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
