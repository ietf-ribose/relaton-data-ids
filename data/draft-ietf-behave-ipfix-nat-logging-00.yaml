abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
    translations and information about the resources it is managing. With the wide
    deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the logging of events have become
    very important for legal purposes. The logs are required in many cases to identify
    an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various
    other purposes of accounting. Since there is no standard way of logging this information,
    different NAT devices behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect a
    consistent behavior. The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write
    the collector applications that would receive this data and process it to present
    useful information. This document describes the information that is required to
    be logged by the NAT devices.</p>"
