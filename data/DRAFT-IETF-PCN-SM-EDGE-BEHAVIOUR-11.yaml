abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting
    the\n   quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv\n   domain.
    \ The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This\n   memo is one
    of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours\n   for a PCN-domain.
    \ The behaviour described here is that for a form of\n   measurement-based load
    control using two PCN marking states, not-\n   marked, and excess-traffic-marked.
    \ This behaviour is known\n   informally as the Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node
    behaviour.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
