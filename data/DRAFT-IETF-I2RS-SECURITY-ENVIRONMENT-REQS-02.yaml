abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides environment security requirements for
    the I2RS\n   architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent
    of\n   the protocol used for I2RS.  The I2RS protocol security requirements\n
    \  set the security for the communication between I2RS client and agent\n   while
    the security environment requirements are rather intended for\n   deployment or
    implementations features independent of the I2RS\n   protocol.  The environmental
    security requirements described in this\n   document provide the good security
    practices to be used with the I2RS\n   protocol so that I2RS protocol implementations
    can be securely\n   deployed and operated.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
