abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft documents low latency requirements in several diverse\n
    \  industries including virtual reality, electrical utilities protection\n   and
    cloud-based service. For each case, this document will identify\n   the application,
    representative solutions used today and its\n   requirements on deterministic
    latency mechanism.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
