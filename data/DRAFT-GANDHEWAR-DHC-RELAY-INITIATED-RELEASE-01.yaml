abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is initiated
    by a DHCP\n   client.  A DHCP server can force DHCP client to send DHCPRENEW by\n
    \  sending a DHCPFORCERENEW message.  There may be multiple DHCP network\n   devices
    connected in between a DHCP client and a server, each one\n   reserving resources
    for the DHCP client.  There are no DHCP messages\n   that a relay can initiate
    in order to control the client binding.\n\n   A DHCP client may not always send
    a DHCPRELEASE message when it no\n   longer needs the IP address and network resources
    for the associated\n   services it is using.  This document specifies a way to
    request\n   release message to be initiated by an intermediate DHCP network\n
    \  device, e.g.  DHCP relay, on behalf of DHCP client.  This helps to\n   relinquish
    network resources sooner than the lease expiration time.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
