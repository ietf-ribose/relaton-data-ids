abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label\n
    \  Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful\n   Intercept
    is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN\n   models do not have
    any provider provisioned methods of lawful\n   intercept that are comprehensive,
    quick and easy to provision from\n   one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning
    of lawful\n   intercept for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and\n
    \  consequent re-direction of these streams to the appropriate\n   government
    network has not been covered without multiple instances of\n   having to configure
    the intercept at various points in the network\n   both in the Single-AS case
    and the Inter-Provider VPN case.\n\n   In this paper, we propose a technique which
    uses a set of pre-defined\n   labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method
    for provisioning\n   lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these
    labels\n   both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single\n
    \  point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is\n   mirrored
    on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs\n   participating in the VPN.
    A technique called the Domino-effect\n   provisioning of these Label-based Provider
    Provisioned Lawful\n   Intercept mechanism is also outlined.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
