abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   HTTP is often used as a substrate for other application protocols\n
    \  (a.k.a.  HTTP-based APIs).  This document specifies best practices\n   for
    such protocols' use of HTTP when they are defined for diverse\n   implementation
    and broad deployment (e.g., in standards efforts).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
