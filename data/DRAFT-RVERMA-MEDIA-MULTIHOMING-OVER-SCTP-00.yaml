abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document discusses the requirements and procedures to achieve
    the\nmultihoming of media for voice over IP sessions using the transport layer\nprotocol
    as signaling Control Transmission Protocol.\n\nMedia is an essential part of any
    voice over IP session. SIP (RFC 3261)\nis a text based signaling protocol and
    Multihoming using SIP can be\nachieved by using the SCTP as a transport protocol
    (RFC 4168),\ntherefore the application level resiliency can be guaranteed even
    in\ncase of any middle node or terminal failures. But any voice over IP or\nmultimedia
    session is nearly insignificant, if the media path is broken\nduring a call and
    is waiting for a timeout which further shall lead to a\ncall drop.A complete solution
    to Multihoming can be achieved if a system\nis capable of a performing the failovers
    \ at both application and media\nplane and still maintaining the session irrespective
    of the application\nor media path failures or at least to detect a signaling or
    media path\nfailure and terminate the session rather than waiting for timeouts.
    The\nrequirement of Multihoming in media can also be derived from the fact\nthat
    in any voice, video or data session, the signaling and call setup\ntime use to
    be incomparably short than that of real media session at\nmedia plane. Therefore
    providing the resiliency at the signaling level\ndoes not provide the guaranteed
    and best effort service from a media\nsession point of view as not only signaling
    but media is an integral\npart of it.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
