abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a method for transporting timing messages, such
    as Precision Time Protocol (PTP) or Network Time Protocol (NTP), over a Multiprotocol
    Label Switched (MPLS) network. The method facilitates efficient recognition of
    timing packets to enable their port level processing in both Label Edge Routers
    (LERs) and Label Switched Routers (LSRs). The basic mechanism is to transport
    timing messages inside "Timing LSPs", which are dedicated MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) that carry only timing, and possibly related Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM) or management packets, but do not carry customer traffic.
    Two encapsulations methods are defined. The first transports UDP/IP encapsulated
    timing messages directly over the dedicated LSP. The second transports Ethernet
    encapsuled timing messages inside an Ethernet pseudowire.</p>
