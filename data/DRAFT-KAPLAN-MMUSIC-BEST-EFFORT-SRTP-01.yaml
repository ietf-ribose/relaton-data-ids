abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines the requirements and a proposed solution
    for \n   an SDP Offer/Answer exchange model for negotiating best-effort SRTP \n
    \  keys, i.e., in a backward-compatible manner with non-SRTP devices.  \n   The
    proposed solution is a trivial interpretation of the usage of \n   the profile
    and the usage of SDP indication of [sdesc] and [kmgmt]. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
