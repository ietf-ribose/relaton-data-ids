abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a measurement method, the IP flow performance
    measurement (IPFPM). With IPFPM, data packets are marked into different blocks
    of markers by changing one or more bits of packets. No additional delimiting packet
    is needed and the performance is measured in-service and in-band without the insertion
    of additional traffic.</p>"
