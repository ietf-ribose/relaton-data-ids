abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In many applications, direct placement of data avoids the overhead
    \nof multiple copies or excessive context switching and is a \ndesirable feature.
    \ To accomplish this using an Internet Protocol, \na direct placement adaptation
    layer is defined within this \ndocument.  This adaptation exists as a small shim
    sitting above \nSCTP.  This shim fragments messages for path compliance, prefixes
    \nthe placement header, and may place data directly into a user \nbuffer.  The
    ultimate goal is to have placement occur by the \nnetwork interface card, where
    this shim coordinates such placement \nwhile proper network layering is maintained.
    \ As SCTP was not \ndesigned to directly handle offset based fragmentation, the
    shim \nhandles message fragmentation to introduce the offsets as well as \ndetermine
    message reception signaling as a result of unordered \ndelivery needed for immediate
    placement.\n\t </p>\n      "
