abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC7344 specifies how DNS trust can be partially maintained
    in-band\n   between parent and child.  There are two features missing in that\n
    \  specification: initial trust setup and removal of trust anchor.  This\n   document
    addresses both these omissions.\n\n   Changing a domain's DNSSEC status can be
    a complicated matter\n   involving multiple unrelated parties.  Some of these
    parties, such as\n   the DNS operator, might not even be known by all organizations\n
    \  involved.  The inability to disable DNSSEC via in-band signalling is\n   seen
    as a problem or liability that prevents some DNSSEC adoption at\n   large scale.
    \ This document adds a method for in-band signalling of\n   this DNSSEC status
    changes.\n\n   Initial trust is considered a much harder problem, this document
    will\n   seek to clarify and simplify the initial acceptance policy.\n\n\t </p>\n
