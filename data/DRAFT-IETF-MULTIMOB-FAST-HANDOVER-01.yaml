abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a multicast handover optimization mechanism\n
    \  for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to accelerate the delivery of multicast traffic\n   to
    mobile nodes after handovers.  The mechanism is based on speeding\n   up the acquisition
    of mobile nodes' active multicast subscriptions\n   information by the mobile
    access gateways.  To do that, extensions to\n   the current Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol are proposed.  These\n   extensions are not only applicable to the base
    solution for multicast\n   support in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but also can be applied
    to other\n   solutions envisioned as possible architectural evolutions of it.\n
    \  Furthermore, they are also independent of the role played by the\n   mobile
    access gateway within the multicast network (either acting as\n   multicast listener
    discovery proxy or multicast router).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
