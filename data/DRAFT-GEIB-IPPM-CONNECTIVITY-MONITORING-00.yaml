abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routed measurement packets can be sent along pre-determined\n
    \  paths.  This allows new kinds of measurements.  Connectivity\n   monitoring
    allows to supervise the state of a connection or a\n   (sub)path from one or a
    few central monitoring systems.  This\n   document specifies a suitable type-P
    connectivity monitoring metric.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
