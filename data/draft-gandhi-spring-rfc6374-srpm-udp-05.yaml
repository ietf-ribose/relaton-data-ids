abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. Segment
    Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR- MPLS) and
    IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This document specifies procedures for using UDP path
    for sending and processing probe query and response messages for Performance Measurement
    (PM). The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 6374 for Performance Delay
    and Loss Measurement. The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6
    data planes for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies measurements.</p>"
