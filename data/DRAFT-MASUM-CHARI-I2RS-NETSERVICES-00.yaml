abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   One of the major features or requirements of Cloud is on-demand
    CRUD\n   (Create / Read / Update / Delete) of Cloud resources or associated\n
    \  resources.  The on-demand feature dictates that resources are CRUD in\n   a
    time-frame in the order of seconds or few minutes since the arrival\n   of the
    resource CRUD request.  Many network resources cannot be CRUD\n   in that time-frame.
    \ With the support of programmable networking (or\n   SDN) in the model of I2RS
    will facilitate programming of network\n   resources rapidly, thus facilitating
    CRUD of Cloud or related network\n   resources on-demand.  Network resources associated
    with many network\n   services can be either a Cloud resource or directly associated
    with a\n   Cloud resource.  These resources should be CRUD on-demand in Cloud\n
    \  timescale.  In this draft, employing Hybrid (virtual) Cloud as a use\n   case
    and using I2RS as the \"model\", we will define few requirements\n   for programmable
    on-demand interfaces to network services or I2NS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
