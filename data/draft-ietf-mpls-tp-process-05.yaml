abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and theITU-T is document in
    RFC 5317 as the decision of the Joint WorkingTeam on MPLS-TP.This document provides
    additional detail of the processes for thedevelopment of IETF RFCs on MPLS-TP.
    It provides an adaptation of theIETF working group process; identifies the expected
    participation inthe process by the ITU-T; and clarifies the rules and conventionsregarding
    MPLS-TP documents.This document does not specify any ITU-T process; ITU-T activitieswill
    be done according to ITU-T process/rules.This document does not specify or modify
    the normal IETF workinggroup process. It is limited to the specific adaptations
    of thatprocess to facilitate the cooperation agreement between the IETF andthe
    ITU-T on MPLS-TP, and to ensure a good and consistent documentreview across the
    two organizations.This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
    Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union TelecommunicationStandardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support thecapabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network.</p>"
