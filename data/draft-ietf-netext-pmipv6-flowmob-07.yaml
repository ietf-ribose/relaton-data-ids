abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces. This document describes extensions
    to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are required to support network based flow
    mobility over multiple physical interfaces. The extensions described in this document
    consist on the operations performed by the local mobility anchor and the mobile
    access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of
    the mobile node, as well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network
    to ensure consistent flow mobility management.</p>"
