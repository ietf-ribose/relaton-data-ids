abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In packet transport networks, there are requirements where
    reverse\n   unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same\n
    \  path as its forward unidirectional LSP.  This document describes how\n   the
    RSVP association signaling is used to bind two co-routed\n   point-to-point unidirectional
    LSPs into an associated co-routed\n   bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning
    case.  Fast-reroute\n   procedures are defined to ensure that the traffic flows
    on the\n   co-routed path after a failure event.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
