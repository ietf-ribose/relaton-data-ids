abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes some extensions to the Post Office Protocol
    [POP3] and are described here for historical purposes. The status of this Internet
    Draft will be Historic. [XTND] describes a mechanism to extend the POP3 protocol,
    called XTND. Two extensions which have been implemented on some server implementations
    are XTND XMIT and XTND XLST; this memo describes these extensions. New implementations
    of POP3 clients and servers are not expected to implement these extensions; other
    mechanisms should be used instead. For example, [SMTP] should be used instead
    of XTND XMIT for sending email. If authentication is needed for sending email,
    then the proposed [ESMTP] [AUTH] extension should be used.</p>"
