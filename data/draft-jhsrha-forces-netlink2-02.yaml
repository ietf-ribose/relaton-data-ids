abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Netlink2, which is an extension of Linux Netlink
    [Netlink]. This document is intended as a proposal for the ForCES IETF working
    group protocol. ForCES attempts to define a clear separation between the two enti-
    ties of the NE in order to have them evolve separetely as opposed to the current
    monolithic evolution.</p>"
