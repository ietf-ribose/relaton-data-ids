abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where
    network\n   nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   incipient
    congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-\n   capable transport protocol
    feed back this information to the sender.\n   ECN is specified for TCP in such
    a way that only one feedback signal\n   can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time
    (RTT).  Recently, new TCP\n   mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data
    Center TCP\n   (DCTCP) need more accurate ECN feedback information whenever more\n
    \  than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document specifies an\n   experimental
    scheme to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT\n   in the TCP header.
    \ Given TCP header space is scarce, it overloads\n   the three existing ECN-related
    flags in the TCP header and provides\n   additional information in a new TCP option.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
