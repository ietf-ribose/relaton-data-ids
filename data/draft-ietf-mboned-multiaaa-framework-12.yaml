abstract:
  content: <p>IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting orvideoconferencing
    raise the issue of making sure that potentialcustomers are fully entitled to access
    the corresponding contents.There is indeed a need for service and content providers
    to identifyusers (if not authenticate, especially within the context ofenforcing
    electronic payment schemes) and to retrieve statisticalinformation for accounting
    purposes, as far as content and networkusage are concerned. This memo describes
    the framework forspecifying the Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA)capabilities
    that could be activated within the context of thedeployment and the operation
    of IP multicast-based services. Thisframework addresses the requirements presented
    in "Requirements forAccounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed
    IPMulticasting Services" [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req]. The memoprovides a basic
    AAA enabled model as well as an extended fullyenabled model with resource and
    admission control coordination.</p>
