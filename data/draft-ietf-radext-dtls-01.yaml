abstract:
  content: <p>The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authenticationand
    encryption of RADIUS packets. The protocol transports data "inthe clear", although
    some parts of the packets can have "hidden"content. Packets may be replayed verbatim
    by an attacker, andclient-server authentication is based on fixed shared secrets.
    Thisdocument specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)protocol
    may be used as a fix for these problems. It also describeshow implementations
    of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUSsystems.</p>
