abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)Transport
    Profile in cooperation between IETF and ITU-T does notfully define and document
    processes for development of the requiredRFCs.This document complements the processes
    documented in the JWTdecision with a few separate elements; it:o provides an adaptation
    of the IETF working group process,o identifies the expected participation in the
    process by the ITU-T,o clarifies the decision rules regarding MPLS-TP documents.This
    document is not intended to specify any ITU-T process; to theextent necessary
    ITU-T activities will be done according to ITU-Tprocess/rules.Nor is this document
    is intended to specify the IETF working groupprocess, it is limited to the temporary
    adaptations of that processthat is the result of that IETF and ITU-T accepted
    the proposal inthe JWT report to jointly develop the MPLS Transport Profile. Ingeneral
    it may be said that these adaptations are introduced toensure a good and consistent
    document review across the twoorganizations.</p>"
