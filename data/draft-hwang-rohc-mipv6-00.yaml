abstract:
  content: "\t <t>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, definesa
    framework for header compression, along with compression protocols(profiles) for
    IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressedpacket streams. And another
    draft [IPPROFILE] posted by Jonssondeals with the IP only profile. However, no
    profile was defined forcompression of IP extension headers. But in the coming
    wirelessapplications, mobile IP will play an important role. In mobile IPv4,there
    is no difference to the packet's IP header, so we don't have tomake a profile
    for mobile IPv4; while as to mobile IPv6[MIPV6], thereis difference, since some
    specific IPv6 extension headers will beincluded in almost every packet in the
    mobile IPv6 packets. Theextension headers will also cost a lot of bandwidth, and
    we should docompression over them. This document addresses this issue anddefines
    a ROHC compression profile for mobile IPv6, which may work asa complementarity
    to the profiles defined by RFC3095.</p>"
