abstract:
- content: "<p>Adaptive DNS Discovery is chartered to define mechanisms that allow
    clients to discover and select encrypted DNS resolvers. This document describes
    one common use case, namely that of clients that connect to a network but where
    they cannot securely authenticate the identity of that network. In such cases
    the client would like to learn which encrypted DNS resolvers are designated by
    that network or by the Do53 resolver offered by that network. It lists requirements
    that any proposed discovery mechanisms should seek to address.</p>"
