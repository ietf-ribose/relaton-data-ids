abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   While the networking technologies have evolved over the years,
    the\n   layered approach has been dominant in many network solutions.  Each\n
    \  layer may have multiple interchangeable, competing alternatives that\n   deliver
    a similar set of functionality.  In order to provide an\n   objective benchmarking
    data among various implementations, the need\n   arises for a common abstract
    model for each network service layer,\n   with a set of required and optional
    specifications in respective\n   layers.  Many overlay and or underlay solutions
    can be described\n   using these models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
