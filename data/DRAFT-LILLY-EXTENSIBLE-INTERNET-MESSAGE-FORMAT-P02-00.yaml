abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in
    RFC 561\n   has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed\n
    \  difficulties for some desirable operations such as digitally signed\n   messages,
    have led to clutter in message content which in turn has\n   led user agent implementers
    to suppress display of some originator\n   message content, leading in some cases
    to user confusion, surprise,\n   and embarrassment.  This memo is part of a multi-document
    series that\n   specifies an extensible message format which is intended to\n
    \  facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format\n   and
    to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content.  This memo\n   defines
    and provides registration information for media types\n   relevant to the extensible
    message format.\n\t </p>\n      "
