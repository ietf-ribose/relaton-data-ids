abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In an EVPN-IRB based network overlay, EVPN LAG enables all-active\n
    \  multi-homing for a host or CE device connected to two or more PEs via\n   a
    LAG bundle, such that bridged and routed traffic from remote PEs\n   can be equally
    load balanced (ECMPed) across the multi-homing PEs.\n   This document defines
    extensions to EVPN procedures to optimally\n   handle unequal access bandwidth
    distribution across a set of multi-\n   homing PEs in order to:\n\n     o provide
    greater flexibility, with respect to adding or\n       removing individual PE-CE
    links within the access LAG\n\n     o handle PE-CE LAG member link failures that
    can result in unequal\n       PE-CE access bandwidth across a set of multi-homing
    PEs\n\n\t </p>\n      "
