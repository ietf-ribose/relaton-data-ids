abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.\n
    \  However, it is expected that some constituent networks of the\n   Internet
    will be \"single protocol\" networks.  One kind of single\n   protocol network
    can parse only IPv4 packets and can process only\n   IPv4 routing information;
    another kind can parse only IPv6 packets\n   and can process only IPv6 routing
    information.  It is nevertheless\n   required that either kind of single protocol
    network be able to\n   provide transit service for the \"other\" protocol.  This
    is done by\n   passing the \"other kind\" of routing information from one edge
    of the\n   single protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the \"other\n
    \  kind\" of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels are\n   known
    as \"Softwires\".  This framework document explains how the\n   routing information
    and the data packets of one protocol are passed\n   through a single protocol
    network of the other protocol.  The\n   document is careful to specify when this
    can be done with existing\n   technology, and when it requires the development
    of new or modified\n   technology.\n\t </p>\n      "
