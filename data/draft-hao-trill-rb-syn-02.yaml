abstract:
- content: "<p>In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge in [TRILLPN],
    was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem at remote RBridges. Based
    on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT]
    was introduced to solve the related RPF issues. In this document, additional problems
    are described regarding virtual Bridges members' state synchronization in multi-homing
    scenario, including virtual RBridge membership auto discovery, pseudo-nickname
    static configuration consistency check, dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT
    configuration synchronization ,LACP configuration and state synchronization, node/link
    failure detection, MAC table synchronization, DHCP snooping information, and dynamically
    joined VLANs and multicast groups. To address these problems, a communication
    protocol among members of a virtual RBridge group should be provided. Requirements
    for this protocol is also discussed.</p>"
