abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Sieve Email Filtering \"include\" extension permits users
    to\ninclude one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing\nlarge scripts
    or multiple sets of scripts much easier, as well as\nsupporting common 'libraries'
    of scripts.  Users are able to include\ntheir own personal scripts or site-wide
    scripts provided by the local\nSieve implementation.\n\nChange History (to be
    removed prior to publication as an RFC)\n\nChanges from -05 to -06:\na.  Aaron
    Stone joins as author.\nb.  Removed | characters from the script examples.\nc.
    \ Updated draft references to published RFCs.\n\nChanges from -04 to -05:\na.
    \ Fixed examples.\nb.  Relaxed requirement that imported/exported variables be
    set\n\n before being used.\n\nChanges from -03 to -04:\na.  Fixed missing 2119
    definitions.\nb.  Defined interaction with variables through use of import and\n\n
    export commands.\n\nChanges from -02 to -03:\na.  Refreshing expired draft (updated
    for nits).\nb.  Syntax -&gt; Usage.\nc.  Updated to 3028bis reference.\n\nChanges
    from -01 to -02:\na.  Minor formatting changes only - refreshing expired draft.\n\nChanges
    from -00 to -01:\na.  Added IPR boiler plate.\nb.  Re-ordered sections at start
    to conform to RFC style.\nc.  Moved recursion comment into General Considerations
    section.\nd.  Switched to using optional parameter to indicate personal vs\n\n
    global.\ne.  Explicitly state that an error occurs when a missing script is\n\n
    included.Open Issues (to be resolved prior to publication as an RFC)\n\na.  Interaction
    with variables (scoping).  Should variables be\n\n carried over between scripts
    that are included?  Or should\n\n variables defined in an included script be local
    to that script\n\n only?\n\t </p>\n      "
