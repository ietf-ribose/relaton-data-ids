abstract:
- content: <p>An Endorsement is defined by the RATS Architecture as a "secure statement
    that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of an Attester's
    signing capability". This documents defines Claims to be used in CBOR Web Tokens
    in the same fashion attestation Evidence can be represented via Entity Attestation
    Tokens (EAT). The defined Claims can be included in Endorsement Tokens. Endorsement
    Tokens can be provided by a manufacturer or a third party authority to vouch for
    the capabilities and characteristics of a hardware component a RATS Attester is
    not capable to create Evidence about.</p>
