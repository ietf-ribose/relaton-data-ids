abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   By now, most Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates
    are\n   issued via the ACME protocol.  Recently, several attacks against\n   domain
    validation (DV) have been published, including IP-use-after-\n   free, (forced)
    on-path attacks, and attacks on protocols used for\n   validation.  In general,
    these attacks can be mitigated by\n   (selectively) requirering additional challenges,
    e.g., DNS\n   validation, proof of prior-key-ownership, or in severe cases even\n
    \  extended validation (EV) instead of DV.  This document provides a\n   list
    of critical cases and describes which mitigations can be used to\n   reduce the
    threat of issuing a certificate to an unauthorized party.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
