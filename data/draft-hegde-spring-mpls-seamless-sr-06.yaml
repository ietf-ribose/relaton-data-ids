abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents a set of use cases and requirements for end-to-
    end intent-based paths spanning multi-domain packet networks. The document explicitly
    focuses on use cases that require high scale and availability, which will likely
    benefit from distributed solutions. It is intended that the requirements in this
    document serve as a basis for future IETF work to develop distributed solutions
    for inter-domain intent-based transport paths.</p>"
