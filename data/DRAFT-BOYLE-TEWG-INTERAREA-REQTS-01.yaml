abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n    Traffic engineering using MPLS within a single IGP area
    has become\n    quite prevalent in networks today.  This gives a network operator\n
    \   several advantages, including better traffic measurement\n    capabilities,
    faster restoration times, and of course the ability\n    to better manage congestion
    points within their network.  However,\n    the current uses have been limited
    to one IGP area.  OSPF based\n    networks usually do traffic engineering only
    in their backbone\n    area, and many ISIS networks still operate at a single
    level.  It\n    would be useful to be able to extend these capabilities across\n
    \   hierarchical areas within a single IGP, as well as to be able to\n    extend
    across AS boundaries if it is found to be useful and\n    possible.  This document
    first considers current applications of\n    MPLS traffic engineering (TE), and
    then it addresses how these\n    might be used (or precluded) across IGP areas.
    \ For the purposes\n    of this document, IGP areas refers both to OSPF areas
    and ISIS\n    multi-level hierarchies.  Requirements for Inter-AS TE can be\n
    \   found in [INTER-AS-TE].\n\n    Please direct comments on this document to
