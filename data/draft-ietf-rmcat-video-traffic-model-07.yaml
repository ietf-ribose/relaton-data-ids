abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two reference video traffic models for evaluating
    RTP congestion control algorithms. The first model statistically characterizes
    the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on the target
    video rate. The second model is trace-driven and emulates the output of actual
    encoded video frame sizes from a high-resolution test sequence. Both models are
    designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and authenticity
    in modeling the interactions between a live video traffic source and the congestion
    control module. Finally, the document describes how both approaches can be combined
    into a hybrid model.</p>"
