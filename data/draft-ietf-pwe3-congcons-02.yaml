abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling traffic,
    and may be found in unmanaged scenarios competing for network resources both with
    other PWs and with non-PW traffic, such as TCP/IP flows. It is thus worthwhile
    specifying under what conditions such competition is safe, i.e., the PW traffic
    does not significantly harm other traffic or contribute more than it should to
    congestion. We conclude that PWs transporting responsive traffic behave as desired
    without the need for additional mechanisms. For inelastic PWs (such as TDM PWs)
    we derive a bound under which such PWs consume no more network capacity than a
    TCP flow. We also propose employing a transport circuit breaker [I-D.fairhurst-tsvwg-circuit-breaker]
    that shuts down a TDM PW consistently surpassing this bound, as the emulated TDM
    service itself would be be of insufficient quality.</p>"
