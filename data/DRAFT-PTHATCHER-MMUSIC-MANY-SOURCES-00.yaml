abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple
    media\n   sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m=\n   sections,
    especially when there are a large number of video sources\n   which change frequently
    and need dynamic resolution changes, such as\n   in a video conferencing system.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
