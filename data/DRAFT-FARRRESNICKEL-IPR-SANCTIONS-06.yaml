abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF has developed and documented policies that govern
    the\n   behavior of all IETF participants with respect to Intellectual\n   Property
    Rights (IPR) about which they might reasonably be aware.\n\n   The IETF takes
    conformance to these IPR policies very seriously.\n   However, there has been
    some ambiguity as to what the appropriate\n   sanctions are for the violation
    of these policies, and how and by\n   whom those sanctions are to be applied.\n\n
    \  This document discusses these issues and provides a suite of\n   potential
    actions that can be taken within the IETF community in\n   cases related to patents.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
