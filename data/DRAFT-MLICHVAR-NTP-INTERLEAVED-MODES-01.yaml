abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document extends the specification of Network Time Protocol\n
    \  (NTP) version 4 in RFC 5905 with special modes called the NTP\n   interleaved
    modes, that enable NTP servers to provide their clients\n   and peers with more
    accurate transmit timestamps that are available\n   only after transmitting NTP
    packets.  More specifically, this\n   document describes three modes: interleaved
    client/server,\n   interleaved symmetric, and interleaved broadcast.\n\n\t </p>\n
