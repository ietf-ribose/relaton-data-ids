abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document proposes an approach to flood OSPF link state\n
    \  advertisements on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete OSPF\n   topology
    per underline physical network, so that the amount of\n   flooding traffic in
    the network is greatly reduced, and it would\n   reduce convergence time with
    a more stable and optimized routing\n   environment.  The approach can be applied
    to any network topology in\n   a single OSPF area, and can be used in both OSPFv2
    ([RFC2328])\n   network and OSPFv3 ([RFC5340]) network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
