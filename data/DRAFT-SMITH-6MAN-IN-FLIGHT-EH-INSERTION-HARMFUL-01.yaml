abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In the past few years, as well as currently, there have and
    are a\n   number of proposals to insert IPv6 Extension Headers into existing\n
    \  IPv6 packets while in-flight.  This contradicts explicit prohibition\n   of
    this type of IPv6 packet proccessing in the IPv6 standard.  This\n   memo describes
    the possible failures that can occur with EH\n   insertion, the harm they can
    cause, and the existing model that is\n   and should continue to be used to add
    new information to an existing\n   IPv6 and other packets.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
