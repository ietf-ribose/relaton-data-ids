abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric\n
    \  password authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual\n   authentication
    in a client-server setting without any reliance on\n   PKI.  OPAQUE is the first
    PKI-free aPAKE to accommodate secret salt\n   and therefore it is the first to
    be secure against pre-computation\n   attacks upon server compromise.  In contrast,
    prior aPAKE protocols\n   did not use salt and if they did, the salt was transmitted
    in the\n   clear from server to user allowing for the building of targeted\n   pre-computed
    dictionaries.  OPAQUE security has been proven by\n   Jarecki et al.  (Eurocrypt
    2018) in a strong and universally\n   composable formal model of aPAKE security.
    \ In addition, the protocol\n   provides forward secrecy and the ability to hide
    the password from\n   the server even during password registration.\n\n   Strong
    security, good performance and an array of additional features\n   make OPAQUE
    a natural candidate for practical use and for adoption as\n   a standard.  To
    this end, this draft presents several optimized\n   instantiations of OPAQUE and
    ways of integrating OPAQUE with TLS.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
