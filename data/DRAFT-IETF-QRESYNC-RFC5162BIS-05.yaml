abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate
    changes to\n   a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working
    on\n   behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared\n   mailboxes.
    \ These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state\n   changes for messages
    within the mailbox.  They must be able to\n   guarantee that only one client can
    change message state (e.g.,\n   message flags of the specific message being looked
    up) at any time.\n   An example of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox
    as a\n   message queue with multiple dequeueing clients.\n\n   The Conditional
    Store facility provides a protected update mechanism\n   for message state information
    that can detect and resolve conflicts\n   between multiple writing mail clients.\n\n
    \  The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly\n   resynchronize
    mailbox flag changes.\n\n   This document additionally defines another IMAP extension,
    which\n   gives an IMAP client the ability to quickly resynchronize any\n   previously
    opened mailbox as part of the SELECT command, without the\n   need for server-side
    state or additional client round-trips.  This\n   extension also introduces a
    new response that allows for a more\n   compact representation of a list of expunged
    messages (and always\n   includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs) expunged).\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
