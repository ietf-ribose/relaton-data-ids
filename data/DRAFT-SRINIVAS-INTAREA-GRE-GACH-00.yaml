abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 5586 defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism
    for\n   MPLS paths that enables multiplexing of auxiliary traffic over such\n
    \  paths along with the user traffic they carry.  Such auxiliary traffic\n   is
    commonly used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   protocols that
    enable monitoring and management of the path.  This\n   document describes the
    applicability of the G-ACh mechanism to\n   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
    tunnels.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
