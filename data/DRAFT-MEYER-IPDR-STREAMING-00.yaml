abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo defines a mechanism to deliver streams of network usage\ninformation
    which follow the Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR)\nformat.  This format
    provides an extensible means to exchange usage\ninformation between systems.  The
    model of extension is based on the\nuse of a subset of the XML Schema specification
    language, in\nconjunction with a well defined mapping to a binary format based
    on\nthe eXtensible Data Record (XDR).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
