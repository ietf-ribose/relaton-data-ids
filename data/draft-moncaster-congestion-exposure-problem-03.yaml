abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Today's Internet is a product of its history. TCP is the maintransport
    protocol responsible for sharing out bandwidth andpreventing a recurrence of congestion
    collapse while packet drop isthe primary signal of congestion at bottlenecks.
    Since packet drop(and increased delay) impacts all their customers negatively,
    networkoperators would like to be able to distinguish between overlyaggressive
    congestion control and a confluence of many low-bandwidth,low-impact flows. But
    they are unable to see the actual congestionsignal and thus, they have to implement
    bandwidth and/or usage limitsbased on the only information they can see or measure
    (the contentsof the packet headers and the rate of the traffic). Such measuresdon't
    solve the packet-drop problems effectively and are leading tocalls for government
    regulation (which also won't solve the problem).We propose congestion exposure
    as a possible solution. This allowspackets to carry an accurate prediction of
    the congestion they expectto cause downstream thus allowing it to be visible to
    ISPs andnetwork operators. This memo sets out the motivations for congestionexposure
    and introduces a strawman protocol designed to achievecongestion exposure.</p>"
