abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) is predicated
    on\n   the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-user requests in\n
    \  a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN (uCDN).  The\n   uCDN
    must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to handle\n   individual requests.
    \ The CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement\n   interface (FCI) is provided
    for the advertisement of capabilities and\n   the footprints to which they apply
    by the dCDN to the uCDN.  This\n   document describes an approach to implementing
    the CDNI FCI.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
