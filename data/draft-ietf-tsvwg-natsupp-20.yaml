abstract:
- content: "<p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provides a reliable
    communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP). With the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators
    (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT functions for TCP that allows multiple
    hosts to reside behind a NAT function and yet share a single IPv4 address, even
    when two hosts (behind a NAT function) choose the same port numbers for their
    connection. This additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and
    Port Translation (NAPT). This document describes the protocol extensions required
    for the SCTP endpoints and the mechanisms for NAT functions necessary to provide
    similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi point traversal scenario.
    Finally, a YANG module for SCTP NAT is defined.</p>"
