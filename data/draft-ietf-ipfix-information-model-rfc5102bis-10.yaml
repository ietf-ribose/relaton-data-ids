abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the data types and management policy for the information
    model for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol. This information model
    is maintained as the IANA "IPFIX Information Elements" registry, the initial contents
    of which were defined by RFC 5102. This information model is used by the IPFIX
    protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information related to
    the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering Process, and the Exporting
    Process. Although this model was developed for the IPFIX protocol, it is defined
    in an open way that allows it to be easily used in other protocols, interfaces,
    and applications. This document obsoletes RFC 5102.</p>
