abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Carrier grade NAT (CGN) devices are required to log events
    like\n   creation and deletion of translations and information about the\n   resources
    it is managing.  The logs are required in many cases to\n   identify an attacker
    or a host that was used to launch malicious\n   attacks and/or for various other
    purposes of accounting.  Since there\n   is no standard way of logging this information,
    different NAT devices\n   behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect
    a consistent\n   behavior.  The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to
    write\n   the collector applications that would receive this data and process\n
    \  it to present useful information.  This document describes the\n   information
    that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
