abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR)
    in\n   documents produced within the IETF stream is essential to the\n   accurate
    development of community consensus.  However, this process\n   is not always followed
    by IETF participants.  Regardless of the cause\n   or motivation, noncompliance
    with IPR disclosure rules can delay or\n   even derail completion of IETF specifications.
    \ This document\n   describes some strategies for promoting compliance with the
    IPR\n   disclosure rules.  These strategies are primarily intended for use by\n
    \  area directors, working group chairs, and working group secretaries.\n\n\t
