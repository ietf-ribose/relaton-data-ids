abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   A DECADE system must provide discovery mechanisms which enable
    the\n   automatic configuration of DECADE clients with all information\n   necessary
    to contact appropriate DECADE servers in the network.\n   Typically, this configuration
    information would include the domain\n   name or IP address of each DECADE server
    that should be considered by\n   the client.  Ideally, a DECADE discovery mechanism
    should capitalize\n   upon existing Internet protocols, such as DHCP, which is
    widely\n   deployed today.  This document discusses DECADE server discovery and,\n
    \  as a first step towards automatic discovery, specifies how a DECADE\n   client
    can obtain server location information using DHCP.  To this\n   end, it defines
    two DHCPv6 options which can be used to automatically\n   provision the domain
    name or IP address of suitable servers in a\n   DECADE system.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
