abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines
    an\n   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize\n   information
    exchange between the control plane and the forwarding\n   plane in a ForCES Network
    Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined\n   the ForCES Model provides a formal
    way to represent the capabilities,\n   state, and configuration of forwarding
    elements within the context of\n   the ForCES protocol, so that control elements
    (CEs) can control the\n   FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes
    the logical\n   functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these\n
    \  functions support, and how these functions are or can be\n   interconnected.\n\n
    \  The ForCES model provides the necessary abstractions to natively\n   support
    virtualization of the forwarding plane.  This documents\n   describes a formal
    approach to model the necessary parameters\n   required for defining and managing
    virtual network forwarding planes\n   to create virtual network elements.\n\n\t
