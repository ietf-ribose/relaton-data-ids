abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers
    to\n   participate in the IETF Nominating Committee.  It therefore also\n   updates
    the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall\n   petition.  The
    purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view\n   of increasing remote
    participation in the IETF and a probable decline\n   in face-to-face meetings.
    \ This document updates RFC8713.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
