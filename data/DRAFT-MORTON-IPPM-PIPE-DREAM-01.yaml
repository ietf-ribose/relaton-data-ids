abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo addresses the problem of defining relevant properties
    and\n   metrics with the goal of improving Internet access for all users.\n   Where
    the fundamental metrics are well-defined, a framework to\n   standardize new metrics
    exists and been used with success.  Users\n   consider reliability to be important,
    as well as latency and\n   capacity; it really depends who you ask and their current\n
    \  experiences.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
