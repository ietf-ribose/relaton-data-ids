abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that allows
    resource representations to indicate that they are following one or more profiles.
    A profile is defined to not alter the semantics of the resource representation
    itself, but to allow clients to learn about additional semantics (constraints,
    conventions, extensions) that are associated with the resource representation,
    in addition to those defined by the media type and possibly other mechanisms.
    Editorial Note (to be removed by RFC Editor) Please discuss this draft on the
    apps-discuss@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
