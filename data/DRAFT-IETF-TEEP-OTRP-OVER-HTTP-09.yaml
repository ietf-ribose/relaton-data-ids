abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol
    is\n   used to manage code and configuration data in a Trusted Execution\n   Environment
    (TEE).  This document specifies the HTTP transport for\n   TEEP communication
    where a Trusted Application Manager (TAM) service\n   is used to manage code and
    data in TEEs on devices that can initiate\n   communication to the TAM.  An implementation
    of this document can (if\n   desired) run outside of any TEE, but interacts with
    a TEEP\n   implementation that runs inside a TEE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
