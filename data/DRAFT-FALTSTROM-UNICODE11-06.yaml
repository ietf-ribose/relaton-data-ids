abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.3.0 and
    Unicode\n   11.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  It further suggests a path\n   forward
    for the IETF to ensure IDNA2008 follows the evolution of the\n   Unicode Standard.\n\n
    \  Some changes have been made in the Unicode Standard related to the\n   algorithm
    IDNA2008 specifies.  IDNA2008 allows adding exceptions to\n   the algorithm for
    backward compatibility; however, this document\n   makes no such changes.  Thus
    this document requests that IANA update\n   the tables to Unicode 11.\n\n   The
    document also recomments that all DNS registries continue the\n   practice of
    calculating a repertoire using conservatism and inclusion\n   principles.\n\n
    \  TO BE REMOVED AT TIME OF PUBLICATION AS AN RFC:\n\n   This document is discussed
    on the i18nrp@ietf.org mailing list of the\n   IETF.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
