abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking\n
    \  logic to elect single best path among multiple possible.  At the same\n   time,
    it has been common in virtually all BGP implementations to\n   allow for \"equal-cost
    multipath\" (ECMP) election and programming of\n   multiple next-hops in routing
    tables.  This documents summarizes some\n   common considerations for the ECMP
    logic, with the intent of\n   providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized
    feature.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
