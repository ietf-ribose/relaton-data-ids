abstract:
  content: "<p>Global roaming is one of the design objectives for next generation(3G)
    cellular networks. To efficiently support real-timeapplications for mobile users
    in these networks, signaling andpayload traffic delays must be minimal. It has
    been identified thatone of the sources causing long delays is triangle routing.
    That is,for example, in the registration process the registration requestshave
    to be transmitted from a foreign agent in the visited networkall the way to the
    home network every time the mobile node initiatesa call or when the mobile node
    roams into a different visitingnetwork [2].</p>"
