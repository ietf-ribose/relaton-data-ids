abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC
    object\n   for communicating errors.  That object has a defined format that\n
    \  permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As RSVP has been\n   developed
    and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in\n   defining new error
    codes.  Further, no provision for user defined\n   errors exists in RSVP.\n\n
    \  This document defines a new RSVP object to permit user defined error\n   values
    to be communicated.\n\t </p>\n      "
