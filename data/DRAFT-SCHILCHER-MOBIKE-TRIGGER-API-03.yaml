abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>MOBIKE is a protocol which adds mobility and multihome support
    for\nIKEv2.  MOBIKE peers continuously exchange a list of available IP\naddresses
    each other.  A MOBIKE peer should have some information\nabout the status of each
    address and interface in order to execute\nthe respective actions.  Examples may
    comprise switching from one\naddress or interface to another.  This information,
    which will be\nreferred as trigger, is distributed over a number of protocol daemons\nat
    an end host.  To make this information available to a MOBIKE\ndaemon, it is necessary
    to store it centrally at the host (called\ntrigger database) and to enable the
    protocols to insert the triggers\nand to allow MOBIKE to obtain timely information.\n\n\n\t
