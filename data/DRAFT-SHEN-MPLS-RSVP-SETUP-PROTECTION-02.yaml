abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism
    for\n   protecting established LSPs against link and node failures.  This\n   document
    extends the mechanism to provide so-called \"setup\n   protection\" for LSPs during
    their initial Path message signaling\n   time.  In particular, it enables a router
    to reroute an LSP via an\n   existing bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the
    immediate\n   downstream link or node along the desired path.  Therefore, it can
    be\n   used to reduce LSP setup time in such a situation, or allow LSPs with\n
    \  strict paths to be established successfully when alternative paths\n   are
    unavailable in the network or unable to be computed by ingress.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
