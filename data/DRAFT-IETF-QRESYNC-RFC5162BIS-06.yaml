abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate
    changes to\n   a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working
    on\n   behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared\n   mailboxes.
    \ These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state\n   changes for messages
    within the mailbox.  The Conditional Store\n   facility allows a client to quickly
    resynchronize mailbox flag\n   changes.\n\n   The Conditional Store facility also
    provides a protected update\n   mechanism for message state information that can
    detect and resolve\n   conflicts between multiple writing mail clients.  For example,
    the\n   mechanism can be used to guarantee that only one client can change\n   message
    state at any time.\n\n   This document additionally defines another IMAP extension,
    which\n   gives an IMAP client the ability to quickly resynchronize any\n   previously
    opened mailbox as part of the SELECT/EXAMINE command,\n   without the need for
    server-side state or additional client round-\n   trips.  That extension builds
    on top of the Conditional Store\n   extension and covers message deletions in
    addition to flag changes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
