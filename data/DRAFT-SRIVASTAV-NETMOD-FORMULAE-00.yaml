abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Operational data can be divided into multiple categories like
    i)\n   state data, ii) raw performance counter, iii) Derived/calculated\n   Counters
    by arithmetic operation on raw performance counters also\n   referred as KPIs.
    Existing YANG built-in-types only define the way to\n   model the state data and
    raw performance counters but have no\n   provision for modelling derived performance
    counters representing an\n   equivalent of a simple mathematical formula.\n\n
    \  This document define extensions for the modeling language YANG as new\n   language
    statements, which introduce a method to model KPIs aka\n   mathematical expression
    in YANG data modeling language and describes\n   the syntax and semantics of newly
    added .\n\n   As KPIs require limited number of mathematical operations viz. +,
    /,\n   -, *,minimum, maximum, summation are needed. Hence, +, /, -,\n   *,minimum,
    maximum, summation are needed. Hence, our proposal is to\n   enhance YANG to support
    formula based nodes for these basic\n   arithmetic operations. YANG is enhanced
    to model KPI formulae with\n   basic arithmetic operations.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
