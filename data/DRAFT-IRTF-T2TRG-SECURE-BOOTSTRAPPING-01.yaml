abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document provides an overview of terms that are commonly
    used\n   when discussing the initial security setup of Internet of Things\n   (IoT)
    devices.  This document also presents a brief but illustrative\n   survey of protocols
    and standards available for initial security\n   setup of IoT devices.  For each
    protocol, we identify the terminology\n   used, the entities involved, the initial
    assumptions, the processes\n   necessary for completetion, and the knowledge imparted
    to the IoT\n   devices after the setup is complete.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
