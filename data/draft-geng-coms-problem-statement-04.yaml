- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement of Common Operation and
    Management of Network Slicing (COMS). The purpose of this document is to identify
    the problem space of COMS and discuss the approach COMS is using to match the
    top-down network slice management concern with the underlay technologies. Furthermore,
    the role of a common information model is introduced and corresponding design
    principles are also discussed.</p>"
