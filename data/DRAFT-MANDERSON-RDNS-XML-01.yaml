abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema
    for\n   Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State\n
    \  Transfer (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that\n   has
    been developed and deployed by ICANN in a \"RESTful\" based system\n   since 2011
    and is being used by the registries responsible for\n   reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations
    underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA\n   through an X.509 certificate mediated
    HTTPS transaction.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
