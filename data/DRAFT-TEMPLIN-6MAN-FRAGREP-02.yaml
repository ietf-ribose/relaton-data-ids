abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) provides a fragmentation
    and\n   reassembly service for end systems allowing for the transmission of\n
    \  packets that exceed the path MTU.  However, loss of just a single\n   fragment
    requires retransmission of the original packet in its\n   entirety, with potentially
    devastating effects on performance.  This\n   document specifies an IPv6 fragment
    retransmission scheme that\n   matches the loss unit to the retransmission unit.
    \ The document\n   further specifies an update to Path MTU Discovery that distinguishes\n
    \  hard link size restrictions from reassembly congestion events.\n\n\t </p>\n
