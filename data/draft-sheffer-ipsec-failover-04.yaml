abstract:
  content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certaincomputational
    and communication overhead with respect to the numberof round-trips required and
    the cryptographic operations involved.In remote access situations, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocolis used for authentication, which adds several more round
    trips andtherefore latency.To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure
    recoverycondition is time consuming, especially when an IPsec peer, such as aVPN
    gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with variousend points. A
    high number of concurrent sessions might causeadditional problems for an IPsec
    peer during SA re-establishment.In many failure cases it would be useful to provide
    an efficient wayto resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session. This document proposesan
    extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SAwith a gateway
    in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previouslyestablished IKE SA.A client
    can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected,or alternatively migrate
    to another gateway that is associated withthe previous one. The proposed approach
    conveys IKEv2 stateinformation, in the form of an encrypted ticket, to a VPN client
    thatis later presented to the VPN gateway for re-authentication. Theencrypted
    ticket can only be decrypted by the VPN gateway in order torestore state for faster
    session setup.</p>"
