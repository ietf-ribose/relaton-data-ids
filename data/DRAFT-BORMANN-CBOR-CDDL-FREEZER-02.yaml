abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some\n
    \  features have turned up that would be nice to have.  In the interest\n   of
    completing this specification in a timely manner, the present\n   document was
    started to collect nice-to-have features that did not\n   make it into the first
    RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610.\n\n   It is now time to discuss thawing some of the concepts
    discussed\n   here.  A number of additional proposals have been added.\n\n\t </p>\n
