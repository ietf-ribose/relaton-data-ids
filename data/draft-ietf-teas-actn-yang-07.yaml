abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of
    virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage large-scale
    multi-domain TE networks, so as to facilitate network programmability, automation,
    efficient resource sharing, and end-to- end virtual service aware connectivity
    and network function virtualization services. This document explains how the different
    types of YANG models defined in the Operations and Management Area and in the
    Routing Area are applicable to the ACTN framework. This document also shows how
    the ACTN architecture can be satisfied using classes of data model that have already
    been defined, and discusses the applicability of specific data models that are
    under development. It also highlights where new data models may need to be developed.</p>"
