abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft presents a mechanism to simplify one of the cumbersome
    aspects of mailing, when one needs to send mails only to a subset of mail-ids
    from an alias [ALIAS] . The basic intention is only to minimize the complication
    and difficulty of a mail user when a mail needs to be sent to n - m mail IDs i.e.
    send it to a group Id of n and exclude mfrom the alias [ALIAS] list.</p>"
