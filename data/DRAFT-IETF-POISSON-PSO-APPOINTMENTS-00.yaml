    its 2\nrepresentatives to ICANN's Protocol Support Organization's Protocol\nCouncil
    (PSO-PC).  Additionally, mechanisms that the IETF will adopt\nfor identifying
    candidates for the PSO's appointments to the ICANN\nBoard of Directors are specified.
    \ This process specification\nreflects 2 years of IETF experience with ICANN,
    the PSO-PC and the\nPSO organization, since their inception in 1999.\n\t </p>\n
