abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to
    support\n   some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN and the underlay
    network.  A Virtual Transport Network\n   (VTN) is a virtual underlay network
    which consists of a subset of the\n   network topology and network resources allocated
    from the physical\n   network.  A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or
    a group of\n   VPN+ services.\n\n   In some network scenarios, each VTN can be
    associated with a unique\n   logicial network topology.  This document describes
    a mechanism to\n   build the SR based VTNs using IS-IS Multi-Topology together
    with\n   other well-defined IS-IS extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
