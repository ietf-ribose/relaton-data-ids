abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance
    Internet\n   technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points\n
    \  on Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be\n   built
    from the ground up to account for the fundamentally new\n   properties of quantum
    entanglement.  The first realisations of\n   quantum networks are imminent, but
    there is no practical proposal for\n   how to organise, utilise, and manage such
    networks.  In this memo, we\n   attempt to lay down the framework and introduce
    some basic\n   architectural principles for a quantum internet.  This is intended\n
    \  for general guidance and general interest, but also to provide a\n   foundation
    for discussion between physicists and network specialists.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
