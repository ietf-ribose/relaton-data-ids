abstract:
  content: "<p>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a wide
    variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit
    fabrics, and centralized control clusters. As a result of their role in tying
    together different elements of the system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced
    by all of these components. Therefore, flexibility is the most important aspect
    of a tunneling protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of technology.
    This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol designed to recognize
    and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs.</p>"
