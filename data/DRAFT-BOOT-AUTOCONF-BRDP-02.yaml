abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) may be attached to a fixed\ninfrastructure
    network, like the Internet.  This document specifies a\nmechanism for Border Router
    discovery and utilization in such a\nsubordinate, possibly multi-homed, MANET.
    \ It provides facilities for\nchoosing preferred Border Router(s) and configuring
    IP address(es)\nneeded for communication between MANET nodes and nodes on the\nInternet
    via the selected Border Router.  Autonomous MANETs do not\nhave Border Routers;
    a self-sufficient Address Autoconfiguration\nmechanism for Autonomous MANETs is
    defined as well.\n\t </p>\n      "
