abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of
    really\nbeing present.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video\nstreams
    are used to create this experience.  When these techniques\nare not similar, interoperability
    between different systems is\ndifficult at best, and often not possible.  Conveying
    information\nabout the relationships between multiple streams of media would allow\nsenders
    and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems\nto interwork.  This
    memo describes the most typical and important use\ncases for sending multiple
    streams in a telepresence conference.\n\t </p>\n      "
