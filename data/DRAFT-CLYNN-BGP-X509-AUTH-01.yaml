abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines three X.509 v3 Certificate Extensions.  The\nfirst
    binds a list of IP Address blocks to the public key of the\nsubject of a certificate.
    \ The second binds a list of Autonomous\nSystem Numbers to the public key of the
    subject of a certificate.\nThe third binds a BGP Router Identifier and an Autonomous
    System\nNumber to the public key of the subject of a certificate.  Third\nparties,
    e.g., BGP routers, may use these certificates to verify that\nthe holder of the
    private key corresponding to the public key in the\ncertificate has been properly
    authorized to use resources specified\nin the certificate extension.\n\t </p>\n
