abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>    The IETF is an international group that conducts most of its\n
    \   business using electronic mail however three times a year it\n    conducts
    an open meeting for one week. For the most part the actual\n    mechanics of the
    meeting are organised by the IETF secretariat but\n    there are some requirements
    placed on the organisation hosting the\n    meeting.\n \n    This document attempts
    to provide some guidelines for organisations\n    that wish to volunteer to act
    as host for one of these open\n    meetings. As the IETF growth pattern mirrors
    the Internet itself\n    this document expresses sizes as a percentage of the
    expected\n    attendance rather than use fixed numbers as we expect these numbers\n
    \   to change for each meeting. At the last meeting, in Washington DC\n    there
    were just over 1900 attendees.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
