abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft discusses variations in the TCP 'slow-start restart'
    (SSR)\n   algorithm, and the unintended failure of some variations to properly\n
    \  restart in some environments. SSR is intended to avoid line-rate\n   bursts
    after idle periods, where TCP accumulates permission to send\n   in the form of
    ACKs, but does not consume that permission\n   immediately. SSR's original 'restart
    after send is idle' is commonly\n   implemented as 'restart after receive is idle'.
    The latter\n   unintentionally fails to restart for bidirectional connections
    where\n   the sender's burst is triggered by a reverse-path data packet, such\n
    \  as in persistent HTTP. Both the former and latter are shown to permit\n   bursts
    in other circumstances. Three solutions are discussed, and\n   their implementations
    evaluated.\n \n   This document is a product of the LSAM project at ISI.  Comments
    are\n   solicited and should be addressed to the authors.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
