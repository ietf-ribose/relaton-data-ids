abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The MarNEW workshop aimed to discuss solutions for badnwidth\n
    \  optimisation on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current\n   solutions
    rely on unencrypted content which is not indicative of the\n   security needs
    of today's internet users.  The workshop gathered IETF\n   attendees, IAB members
    and various organisations involved in the\n   telecommunications industry including
    original equipment\n   manufacturers and mobile network operators.\n\n   The group
    discussed the current internet encryption trends and\n   deployment issues identified
    within the IETF, and the privacy needs\n   of users which should be adhered.  Solutions
    designed around sharing\n   data from the network to the endpoints and vice versa
    were then\n   discussed as well as analysing whether the current issues experienced\n
    \  on the transport layer are also playing a role here.  Content\n   providers
    and CDNs gave an honest view of their experiences delivery\n   content with mobile
    network operators.  Finally, technical responses\n   to regulation was discussed
    to help the regulated industries relay\n   the issues of impossible to implement
    or bad-for-privacy technologies\n   back to regulators.\n\n   A group of suggested
    solutions were devised which will be discussed\n   in various IETF groups moving
    forward.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
