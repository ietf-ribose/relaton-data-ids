abstract:
- content: "<p>Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are
    independent of the client. This protocol allows a user and/or resource owner to
    delegate resource authorization and/or release of identity claims to a server.
    Client software can then request access to resources and/or identity claims by
    calling the server. The server acquires consent and authorization from the user
    and/or resource owner if required, and then returns to the client software the
    authorization and identity claims that were approved. This protocol can be extended
    to support alternative authorizations, claims, interactions, and client authentication
    mechanisms.</p>"
