abstract:
  content: "<p>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) acrossmultiple
    domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLSnetworks presents a problem
    because no single point of pathcomputation is aware of all of the links and resources
    in eachdomain. A solution may be achieved using the Path ComputationElement (PCE)
    architecture.Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniquescan
    be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains aresimply-connected, or
    if the preferred points of interconnection arealso known, the Per-Domain Path
    Computation technique can be used.Where there are multiple connections between
    domains and there isno preference for the choice of points of interconnection,
    theBackward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used toderive an
    optimal path.This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path whenthe
    sequence of domains is not known in advance. The documentshows how the PCE architecture
    can be extended to allow the optimumsequence of domains to be selected, and the
    optimum end-to-end pathto be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship
    betweendomains.</p>"
