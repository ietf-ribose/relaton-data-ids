abstract:
- content: "<p>For C-ACC, Platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, how to establish
    direct IP communication paths between neighbor vehicles poses two issues : how
    to discover the neighbor vehicle and the nearby service (from the upper layer);
    how to discover the link-layer address of the selected vehicle (from the lower
    layer). This draft aims to solve these problems based on mDNS.</p>"
