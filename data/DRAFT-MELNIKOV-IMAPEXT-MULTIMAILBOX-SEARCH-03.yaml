abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected\nmailbox.
    \ A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\nclient that wishes to
    support this must issue a series of SELECT and\nSEARCH commands, waiting for each
    to complete before moving on to the\nnext.  This extension allows a client to
    search multiple mailboxes\nwith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting
    for various\nsearches to complete.  This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCH\nresponses,
    allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.Note\n\nA revised version
    of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC\neditor as a Proposed Standard
    for the Internet Community.  Discussion\nand suggestions for improvement are requested,
    and should be sent to\nietf-imapext@imc.org.\n\t </p>\n      "
