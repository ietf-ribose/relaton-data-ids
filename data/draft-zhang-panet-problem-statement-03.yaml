abstract:
- content: "<p>Energy consumption of network infrastructures is growing fast due to
    exponential growth of data traffic and the deployment of increasingly powerful
    equipment. There are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering,
    which adapt routing paths to traffic load in order to reduce energy consumption
    network-wide. This document outlines the design space and problem areas for potential
    IETF work.</p>"
