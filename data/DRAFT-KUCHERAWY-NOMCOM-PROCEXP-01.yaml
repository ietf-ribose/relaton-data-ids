abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The criteria by which one qualifies to be a selecting member
    of the\n   IETF Nominating Committee are somewhat limited, having been developed\n
    \  long before the current IETF meeting model that allows for greater\n   remote
    participation both during and between organized meetings.\n   This document describes
    a process experiment whereby those criteria\n   are extended to meet the IETF's
    current participation model.  If\n   successful, the results of this experiment
    can be folded into our\n   permanent NomCom procedures.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
