abstract:
- content: "<p>The SMTP STARTTLS option, used in negotiating transport-level encryption
    of SMTP connections, is not as useful from a security standpoint as it might be
    because of its opportunistic nature; message delivery is prioritized over security.
    This document describes a complementary SMTP service extension, REQUIRETLS. If
    the REQUIRETLS option is used when sending a message, it causes message transmission
    to fail if a TLS connection with the required security characteristics cannot
    be completed with the next hop MTA, or if that MTA does not also advertise that
    it supports REQUIRETLS. Message originators may therefore expect transport security
    to be used for messages sent with this option.</p>"
