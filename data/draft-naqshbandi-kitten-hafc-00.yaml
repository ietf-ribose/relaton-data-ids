abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the problem of attack on authenticity users.
    The problem is discussed with respect to fog computing environment. The threat
    exist when any user log in to access the service. The two aspects are either the
    fog server is fake or the user node is fake. The information stored on the server
    and transferred over the connection. This information can be highly confidential
    and sensitive. So to enhance security in this scenario, cloud server can authenticate
    both the parties and establish the connection. There are chances that it can get
    attacked and used by illegitimate users. Therefore, there was an utmost need to
    increase the security on authentication of the users. This document discusses
    a novel approach to overcome the problem by using a hybrid approach. The technique
    is based on user authentication and fog authentication by cloud server.</p>"
