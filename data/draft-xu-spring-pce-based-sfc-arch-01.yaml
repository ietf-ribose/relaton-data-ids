abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible way to construct
    services. When applying a particular service function chain to the traffic, the
    traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of service functions in the
    network. This ordered set of service functions in the network, referred to as
    a Service Function Path (SFP), is an instantiation of the service function chain
    in the network. Segment Routing (SR) technique can be leveraged to steer the traffic
    through the SFP in SR networks. This document describes a PCE-based SFC architecture
    in which the PCE is used to compute a service function path (i.e., instantiate
    a service function chain) in SR networks.</p>"
