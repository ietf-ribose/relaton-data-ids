abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses the inadequate approach to security
    within\n   the family of NFSv4 protocol specifications and proposes steps to\n
    \  correct the situation.  Because the security architecture is similar\n   for
    all NFSv4 minor versions, we recommend a single new standards-\n   track document
    to encapsulate NFSv4 security fundamentals, and\n   propose the introduction of
    several additional security-related\n   documents.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
