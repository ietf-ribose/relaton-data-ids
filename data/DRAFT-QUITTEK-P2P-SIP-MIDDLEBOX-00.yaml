abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Middleboxes, particularly firewalls and network address translators,\n
    \  are essential components of today's Internet infrastructure.  They\n   are
    designed to support client-server applications well, but very\n   often they are
    obstacles for peer-to-peer communication.  This memo\n   discusses middlebox traversal
    issues of SIP-based peer-to-peer\n   communication.  Required communication steps
    are analyzed concerning\n   their potential constraints caused by middleboxes.
    \ The requirements\n   derived from this analysis are compared with the capabilites
    of\n   currently available middlebox traversal methods and SIP signaling\n   standards.
    \ The comparison identifies open issues that need to be\n   considered when designing
    standards for a SIP-based peer-to-peer\n   communication infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\t
