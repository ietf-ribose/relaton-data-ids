abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document defines SIP extensions for session recording to meetthe
    requirements in the \"Requirements for SIP-based Media Recording(SIPREC)\" document.
    In particular, mechanisms to allow SIP elementsto distinguish between the Recording
    Session and the CommunicationSession. Also a mechanism for a UA to learn that
    the communicationsession is being recorded is proposed. The Metadata about thesession
    is not covered by this document. SIP feature tags 'srs','src', and 'recorded'
    are defined to identify the Session RecordingServer, Session Recording Client,
    and the presence of recording inthe communication session.</p>"
