abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Work on extensions to IP control protocols for reuse in the controlplane
    of optical transport networks has now been underway for arounda year in the MPLS
    and IPO groups. Recent discussions have howeverhighlighted a lack of defined requirements
    that should be met bycandidate protocols being considered for the optical control
    plane.Indeed, there have been several requests for carriers to submittheir requirements.
    This draft provides one view of some (but by nomeans all) of these requirements.
    A protocol independent approachis taken, and the authors recommend that the design
    of anyparticular facet of an optical control plane should take intoaccount the
    considerations made in this document.</p>"
