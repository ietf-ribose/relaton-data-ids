abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane
    operation\n   over an IP network.  It is primarily aimed at IPv4, but would work\n
    \  with IPv6 as well if a unified solution is desired.\n\n   This document is
    a derivative work from draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01,\n   to augment or replace
    the text currently contained in section 5.2.2.\n\n   Whether this is published
    as a stand-alone text, or serves as a focal\n   point to refine the IP design
    and subsequently remerged with draft-\n   ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01 is a matter for
    the DETNET WG.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
