abstract:
- content: "<p>Current efforts in the scope of Network Function Virtualisation(NFV)
    propose YAML-based descriptors for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and for their
    composition in Network Services (NS) These descriptors are human-readable but
    hardly understandable by humans. On the other hand, there has been an effort proposed
    to the IETF to define a human-readable (and understandable) representation for
    networks, known as NEMO. In this draft, we propose a simple extension to NEMO
    to accommodate VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) in a similar manner as inline assembly
    is integrated in higher-level programming languages. This approach enables the
    creation of recursive VNF forwarding graphs in Service Descriptors, practically
    making them recursive. An implementation generating VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) for
    OpenMANO and OSM is available.</p>"
