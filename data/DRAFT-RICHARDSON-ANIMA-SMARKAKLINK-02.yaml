abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document details the mechanism used for initial enrollment
    using\n   a smartphone of a BRSKI Registrar system.\n\n   There are two key differences
    in assumption from\n   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]: that the intended
    registrar\n   has Internet, and that the Pledge has no user-interface.\n\n   This
    variation on BRSKI is intended to be used in the situation where\n   the registrar
    device is new out of the box and is the intended\n   gateway to the Internet (such
    as a home gateway), but has not yet\n   been configured.  This work is also intended
    as a transition to the\n   Wi-Fi Alliance work on the Device Provisioning Protocol
    (DPP).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
