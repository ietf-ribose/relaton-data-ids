abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge
    (CE)\n   router.  Specifically, the current version of this document focuses\n
    \  on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning\n   of
    IPv6 hosts attached to it and the support of HNCP ([RFC7788]) for\n   automated
    provisioning of downstream routers.  The document also\n   covers several transition
    technologies, as required in a world where\n   IPv4 addresses are no longer available,
    so hosts in the customer LANs\n   with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or
    devices, requiring to\n   communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet,
    are able to do\n   so.  The document obsoletes RFC 7084.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
