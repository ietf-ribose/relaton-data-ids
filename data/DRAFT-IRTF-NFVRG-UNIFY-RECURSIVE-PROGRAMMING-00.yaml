abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The introduction of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in
    carrier-\n   grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility,\n
    \  efficiency, and manageability.  NFV is an approach to combine network\n   and
    compute virtualizations together.  However, network and compute\n   resource domains
    expose different virtualizations and programmable\n   interfaces.  In [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges]
    we argued for a joint\n   compute and network virtualization by looking into different
    compute\n   abstractions.\n\n   In this document we analyze different approaches
    to orchestrate a\n   service graph with transparent network functions relying
    on a public\n   telecommunication network and ending in a commodity data center.
    \ We\n   show that a recursive compute and network joint virtualization and\n
    \  programming has clear advantages compared to other approaches with\n   separated
    control between compute and network resources.  In\n   addition, the joint virtualization
    will have cost and performance\n   advantages by removing additional virtualization
    overhead.  The\n   discussion of the problems and the proposed solution is generic
    for\n   any data center use case; however, we use NFV as an example.\n\n\t </p>\n
