abstract:
- content: "<p>The details of Generic Security Service (GSS) credential store management
    vary by platform and even by GSS mechanism. Credential store management is an
    interesting concept that requires exploration. This document defines a small extension
    to the GSS-API for GSS-API credential store management. While exploration of the
    credential store management problem is the goal of this document, implementation
    of these interfaces is not discounted nor discouraged.</p>"
