abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In any provider-based VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) devices
    \n   attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a \n   prerequisite
    to establish VPN-specific connectivity. The main \n   purpose of an auto-discovery
    mechanism is to enable a PE to \n   dynamically discover the set of remote PEs
    having VPN members in \n   common. The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having
    a PE \n   advertises to other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the \n
    \  list of VPN members configured on that PE. Once that information is \n   received
    the remote PEs will then identify the list of VPN sites\n   members of the same
    VPN, and use the information \n   carried within the discovery mechanism to establish
    VPN \n   connectivity. This draft defines a BGP based auto-discovery \n   mechanism
    for Virtual Router-based layer-3 VPNs. This mechanism is \n   based on the approach
    used by BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN for distributing VPN \n   routing information within the
    service provider(s).\n\t </p>\n      "
