abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   For a short time sometime in the recent past , internet traffic
    sent\n   between a well known site and subscribers to an internet service\n   provider
    A passed through hardware belonging to a Telecom provider B\n   other than the
    ISP A to which the customers were attached before\n   reaching its final destination.
    Telecom Provider B was found to be\n   many AS hops away from the well known site
    and ISP A.  It was assumed\n   that this was an an innocent routing error (which
    is the most likely\n   explanation for the highly circuitous route that the traffic
    was\n   taking), but it was troubling nonetheless.  During a window that\n   lasted
    30 minutes to an hour, all unencrypted traffic passing between\n   the victimised
    ISP's customers and the well known site might have\n   been open to monitoring.
    Though there was no evidence any data was in\n   fact snarfed, but it was felt
    that the potential for that is\n   certainly there because the hardware belonged
    to the untrusted\n   Telecom provider B.\n\n   Many such incidents have occurred
    in the past where the traffic has\n   been diverted through such providers that
    either erroneously have let\n   loose BGP routes or otherwise. At least one of
    those incidents was\n   the result of erroneous BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol,
    routes that\n   were quickly corrected.  The above is a hypothetical headline
    that\n   might occur in the near future if the BGP protocol is subject to such\n
    \  circuitous routing attacks either by mis-configuration or through\n   purposeful
    intent. This is primarily owing to the fact that the BGP\n   protocol accepts
    updates from providers and there exists no mechanism\n   to figure out whether
    the updates for prefixes received was due to\n   mal-intent, mis-configuration
    or indeed correct configuration. So\n   there is a big blind spot that will have
    to be rectified. Doing the\n   rectification through BGP would only complicate
    matters more.\n\n   The proposal in the scheme in this draft, warrants the use
    of MPLS-\n   based inter-AS Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths that are\n
    \  constructed out of a derived inter-AS topology that help to impose\n   policy
    decisions that for eg, obviate or prevent such LSPs from\n   actually going through
    certain specific AS or set of ASes. Using\n   methods like Graph construction
    from AS-PATH-INFO data and methods\n   like policy based clipping of edges and
    nodes from such a inter-AS\n   topology, the solution is made simple. The use
    of PCE (Path\n   Computation Elements) is advised to compute such inter-AS paths
    that\n   avoid ASes. Regular routing would have followed BGP updates and\n   regular
    IP based forwarding. Using the TE-LSPs we can in fact set out\n   the explicit
    route from AS to AS from the head-end to the tail-end\n   avoiding specific set
    of ASes which dictated by policy have to be\n   avoided.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
