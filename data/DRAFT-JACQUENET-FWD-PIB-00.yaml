abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the\n
    \  enforcement of an IP forwarding policy by network devices. Instances\n   of
    such classes reside in a virtual information store, which is\n   called the IP
    Forwarding Policy Information Base (PIB). The\n   corresponding IP forwarding
    policy provisioning data are intended for\n   use by a COPS-PR TE Client-Type,
    and they complement the PRC classes\n   that have been defined in the Framework
    PIB.\n\t </p>\n      "
