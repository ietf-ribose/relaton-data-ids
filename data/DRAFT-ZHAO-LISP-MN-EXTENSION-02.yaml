abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   LISP describes a network-based protocol that enables separation
    of IP\n   addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)\n
    \  and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No changes are required to either host\n   protocol
    stacks or to the \"core\" of the Internet infrastructure.  The\n   LISP Mobile
    Node extension design described in this document uses\n   standard LISP functionality
    to provide scalable mobility for LISP\n   mobile nodes.\n\n   This document extends
    the lisp, it introduces some contents that lisp\n   does not include but the author
    think it is important and\n   recommendation them to be considered in the lisp.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
