abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>When using the telnet protocol to talk to a remote device, as
    one would\nwith RFC 2217, it would be useful to be able to determine\nif the remote
    server is active or not.  In contrast with\nthe ''Are You There'' sub-option,
    the return message is not mixed\ninto the data stream presented to the user or
    client program, it is\nsimply passed between the telnet client/server pair.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
