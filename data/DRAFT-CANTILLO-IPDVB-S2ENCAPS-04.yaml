abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a framework for the transmission of IP\n
    \  datagrams over DVB-S2, the second generation standard for Digital\n   Video
    Broadcasting over Satellite.  The new standard features an\n   improved and adaptive
    physical layer, as well as a new framing\n   structure at link level, the Generic
    Streams.  Combined use of\n   adaptability and Generic Streams is expected to
    offer throughputs\n   never achieved for IP services up to now, but no standard
    way to\n   carry IP data using the specific features of DVB-S2 has been\n   published
    up to date.  The present document analyzes these issues,\n   and it identifies
    the requirements for the definition of a standard\n   interface between the DVB-S2
    link layer and an IP subnetwork.\n\t </p>\n      "
