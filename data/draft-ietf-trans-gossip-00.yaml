abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three gossiping mechanisms for Certificate
    Transparency (CT) [RFC6962]: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and Trusted Auditor
    Relationship. SCT Feedback enables HTTPS clients to share Signed Certificate Timestamps
    (SCTs) (Section 3.2 of [RFC6962]) with CT auditors in a privacy-preserving manner
    by sending SCTs to originating HTTPS servers which in turn share them with CT
    auditors. In STH Pollination, HTTPS clients use HTTPS servers as pools sharing
    Signed Tree Heads (STHs) (Section 3.5 of [RFC6962]) with other connecting clients
    in the hope that STHs will find their way to auditors and monitors. HTTPS clients
    in a Trusted Auditor Relationship share SCTs and STHs with trusted auditors or
    monitors directly, with expectations of privacy sensitive data being handled according
    to whatever privacy policy is agreed on between client and trusted party.</p>"
