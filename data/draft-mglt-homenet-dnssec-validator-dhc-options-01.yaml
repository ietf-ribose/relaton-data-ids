abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC validators.
    However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable value for the current
    time, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed. As a result, there are multiple cases
    where DNSSEC validation MUST NOT be performed. In addition, this list of exceptions
    is expected to become larger over time. Considering an increasing number of cases
    where DNSSEC is disabled adds complexity to the DNSSEC validator implementations
    and increases the vectors that disable security. This document assumes that DNSSEC
    adoption by end devices requires that end devices MUST be able to support a DNSSEC
    validation always set. This MUST be valid today as well as in the future. This
    document describes DHCP Options to provision the DHCP Client with valid trust
    anchors and time so DNSSEC validation can be performed.</p>"
