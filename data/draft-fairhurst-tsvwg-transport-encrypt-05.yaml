abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption
    at the transport layer. It identifies in-network uses of transport layer header
    information. It then reviews the implications of developing encrypted end-to-end
    transport protocols on transport protocol design and the implications on network
    operation. Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics
    have been important to the design of current transport protocols, it also considers
    some anticipated implications on transport and application evolution.</p>"
