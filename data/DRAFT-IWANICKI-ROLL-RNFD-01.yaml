abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   By and large, a correct operation of a RPL network requires
    border\n   routers to be up.  In many applications, it is beneficial for the\n
    \  nodes to detect a crash of a border router as soon as possible to\n   trigger
    fallback actions.  This document describes RNFD, an extension\n   to RPL that
    expedites border router failure detection, even by an\n   order of magnitude,
    by having nodes collaboratively monitor the\n   status of a given border router.
    \ The extension introduces an\n   additional state at each node, a new type of
    RPL Control Message\n   Options for synchronizing this state among different nodes,
    and the\n   coordination algorithm itself.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
