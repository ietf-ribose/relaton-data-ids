abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines requirements for standards specifications
    for\n   energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern\n
    \  monitoring functions as well as control functions.  Monitoring\n   functions
    include identification of energy-managed devices and their\n   components, monitoring
    of their power states, power inlets, power\n   outlets, actual power (the instantaneous
    power, as opposed to the\n   demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes,
    received\n   energy, provided energy, and contained batteries.  Control functions\n
    \  serve for controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed\n   devices
    and their components.\n   This document does not specify the features that must
    be implemented\n   by compliant implementations but rather features that must
    be\n   supported by standards for energy management.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
