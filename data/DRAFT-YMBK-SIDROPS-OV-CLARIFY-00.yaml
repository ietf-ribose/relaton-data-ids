abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered
    by, among\n   other things, vendor mis-implementions in two critical areas, which\n
    \  routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified\n   by
    configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible\n   misunderstandings
    causing those mis-implementatons.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
