abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to
    determine\n   if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined transport\n   performance
    targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive subpaths.
    \ The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to key infrastructure,
    such as interconnects, to accurately\n   detect if it will prevent the full end-to-end
    paths that traverse it\n   from meeting the specified target performance.\n\n
    \  Each IP diagnostic test consists of a precomputed traffic pattern and\n   a
    statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery.  The traffic\n   patterns
    are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n   over a long path
    but are independent of the actual details of the\n   subpath under test.  Likewise
    the success criteria depends on the\n   target performance for the long path and
    not the details of the\n   subpath.  This makes the measurements open loop, which
    introduces\n   several important new properties and eliminates most of the\n   difficulties
    encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics.\n\n   This document does not
    define diagnostic tests, but provides a\n   framework for designing suites of
    diagnostics tests that are tailored\n   the confirming the target performance.\n\n
