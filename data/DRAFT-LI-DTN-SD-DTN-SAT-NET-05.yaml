abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for
    a severe\n   environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works\n
    \  as an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some\n   convergence
    layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol\n   (LTP). DTN is suitable
    for satellite networks. Because communication\n   delay is long and peer-to-peer
    communication is not guaranteed in\n   satellite networks. We implement SDN to
    solve the problems of\n   controllable, manageable, and flexible in satellite
    networks. In\n   this document, we propose a framework of Software Defined DTN-based\n
    \  satellite networks, using Bundle tunnel and protocol translation\n   gateway.\n\n\n\n\t
