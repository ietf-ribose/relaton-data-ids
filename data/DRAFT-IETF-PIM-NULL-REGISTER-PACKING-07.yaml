abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In PIM-SM networks PIM Register messages are sent by the Designated\n
    \  Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of\n   Multicast
    sources in the network.  There are periodic PIM Null-\n   Registers sent from
    the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at the\n   RP as long as the source is
    active.  The PIM Null-Register message\n   carries information about a single
    Multicast source and group.\n\n   This document defines a standard to send multiple
    multicast source\n   and group information in a single PIM Null-Register message,
    in a\n   packed format.  This document also discusses the interoperability\n   between
    the PIM routers which do not understand the packed message\n   format with multiple
    multicast source and group details.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
