abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>BroadVoice(R) [bv-website] is a family of two open-source speech
    \ncodecs suitable for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  It is \ndesigned to
    achieve high speech quality with relatively low \ncomplexity and a very low coding
    delay.  BroadVoice consists of two \nvariants: a 16 kb/s narrowband codec for
    8 kHz sampling called \nBroadVoice16, or BV16, and a 32 kb/s wideband codec for
    16 kHz \nsampling called BroadVoice32, or BV32.  BV16 and BV32 are standard \ncodecs
    of PacketCable(TM), SCTE(R), and ANSI for VoIP applications \nin cable telephony,
    and they are also listed as optional codecs in \nthe ITU-T Recommendations J.161
    and J.361, respectively.  This \ndocument describes the BV16 and BV32 speech codecs.\n\t
