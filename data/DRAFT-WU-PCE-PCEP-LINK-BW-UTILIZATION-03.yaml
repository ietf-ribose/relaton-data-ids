abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides\n   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n
    \  computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n\n   The
    Link bandwidth utilization (the total bandwidth of a link in\n   current use for
    the forwarding) is an important factor to consider\n   during path computation.
    \ [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS]\n   define mechanisms that distribute
    this information via OSPF and ISIS\n   respectively.  This document describes
    extensions to PCEP to use them\n   as new constraints during path computation.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
