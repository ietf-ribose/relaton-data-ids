abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>In the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection (or interworking),\nseveral
    solutions have been proposed within IETF.  Some of these\nsolutions require the
    definition of a new IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address\nwhich is used to represent an
    IPv4-only host in an IPv6 realms and\nthe definition of a new mechanism called
    DNS64 for synthesizing a\nAAAA record, representing an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address
    in the DNS\nsystem, from the A record representing the IPv4 address of the IPv4-\nonly
    host .  This IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address, when managed by a\ntranslator, is to
    be considered as \"fake\" address in a DNS system\nsince it is not necessarily
    assigned to any host's interface\nqualified by the associated name.\n\nThis document
    defines a new DNS record type and query type to\nidentify IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address
    from native IPv6 ones.  The new\nrecord type and query type aim at helping the
    requesting party to\nenforce its policies and avoid crossing NAT64 boxes when
    possible.\nNative addresses are to be preferred.\n\t </p>\n      "
