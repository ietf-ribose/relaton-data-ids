abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is
    the\n   Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are\n   fundamentally
    different from the DNS, and may or may not share the\n   same namespace.\n\n   When
    an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which\n   supports multiple,
    different protocols (or resolution mechanisms) for\n   name resolution, it is
    desirable that the protocol used is\n   unambiguous, and that requests intended
    for one protocol are not\n   inadvertently answered using another.\n\n   [RFC6761]
    introduced a framework by which, under certain\n   circumstances, a particular
    domain name could be acknowledged as\n   being special.  This framework has been
    used twice to reserve top-\n   level domains (.local and .onion) that should not
    be used within the\n   DNS to avoid the possibility of namespace collisions in
    parallel use\n   of non-DNS name resolution protocols.\n\n   Various challenges
    have become apparent with this application of the\n   guidance provided in [RFC6761].
    \ This document aims to document those\n   challenges in the form of a problem
    statement, to facilitate further\n   discussion of potential solutions.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
