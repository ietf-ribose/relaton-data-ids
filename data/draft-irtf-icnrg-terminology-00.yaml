abstract:
- content: "<p>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where network
    communications are accomplished by requesting named content, instead of sending
    packets to destination addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric
    Networking (CCN) are two prominent ICN architectures. This document provides an
    overview of the terminology and definitions that have been used in describing
    concepts in these two projects. While there are other ICN architectures, they
    are not part of the NDN and CCN vision and as such are out of scope for this document.</p>"
