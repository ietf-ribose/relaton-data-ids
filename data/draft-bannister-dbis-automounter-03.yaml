abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support the automount database. The automount
    database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information Service
    [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with the
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. An automount database contains
    information about file system mount- points that are to be mapped by the automounter.
    This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis- mapping-00]
    for the automount database, and database entries referenced by those maps.</p>"
