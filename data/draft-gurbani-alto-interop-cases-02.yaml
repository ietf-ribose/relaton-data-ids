abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such
    information to applications that need to choose one or more endpoints to connect
    to among large sets of logically equivalent ones. This document provides a collection
    of messages that may be used to test the functionality and interoperability of
    an ALTO client and an ALTO server.</p>"
