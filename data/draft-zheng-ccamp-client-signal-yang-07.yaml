abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
    services to its client. The topology and tunnel information in the transport layer
    has already been defined by generic Traffic- engineered models and technology-specific
    models (e.g., OTN, WSON). However, how the client signals are accessing to the
    network has not been described. These information is necessary to both client
    and provider. This draft describes how the client signals are carried over transport
    network and defines YANG data models which are required during configuration procedure.
    More specifically, several client signal (of transport network) models including
    ETH, STM-n, FC and so on, are defined in this draft.</p>"
