abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides configuration parameters such as
    IPv6\n   network addresses for hosts.  The unencrypted nature and use of\n   various
    identifiers make its privacy and security become more\n   vulnerable.  With appropriate
    protection mechanisms, the privacy and\n   security can be improved to some extent.
    \ This document specifies\n   such a mechanism that builds a trusted relationship
    between DHCPv6\n   clients and servers before solicitation.  The mechanism enables
    a\n   valid client to find and access the legitimate server or reject and\n   blacklist
    a rogue server.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
