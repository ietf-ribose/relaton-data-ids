abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that\n
    \  \"localhost\" can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's\n   loopback
    interface.  To that end, stub resolvers are required to\n   resolve localhost
    names to loopback addresses.  Recursive DNS servers\n   are required to return
    \"NXDOMAIN\" when queried for localhost names,\n   which will cause non-conformant
    stub resolvers to fail safely closed.\n   Together, these requirements would allow
    applications and\n   specifications to join regular users in drawing the common-sense\n
    \  conclusions that \"localhost\" means \"localhost\", and doesn't resolve\n   to
    somewhere else on the network.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
