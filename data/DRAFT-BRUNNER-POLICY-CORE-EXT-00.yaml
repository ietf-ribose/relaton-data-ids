abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo should help starting the discussion on extensions of
    the\nPolicy Framework Core Information Model (PCIM).  It does not replace\nnor
    change concepts used in PCIM, but tries to add concepts, which\ncould help different
    application areas to define policies more easily\nby reusing some of the concepts
    proposed in this draft.  The draft\nbasically tries to generalize concepts introduced
    by other drafts\nsuch as the Policy Framework QoS Information Model [PQIM].  The
    focus\nlies in means for specifying general conditions and actions.\nAdditionally,
    group ordering, events, and variables are introduced.\n\t </p>\n      "
