abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
    based distributed flow-mapping-fabric for dynamic scaling of virtualized network
    functions (NFV). Network functions such as subscriber-management, content-optimization,
    security and quality of service, are typically delivered using proprietary hardware
    appliances embedded into the network as turn-key service-nodes or service-blades
    within routers. Next generation network functions are being implemented as pure
    software instances running on standard servers - unbundled virtualized components
    of capacity and functionality. LISP-SDN based flow-mapping, dynamically assembles
    these components to whole solutions by steering the right traffic in the right
    sequence to the right virtual function instance.</p>"
