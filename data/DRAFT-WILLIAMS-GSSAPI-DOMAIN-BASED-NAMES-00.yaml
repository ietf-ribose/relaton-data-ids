abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes domainname-based service principal
    names and\n   the corresponding name type for the GSS-API.\n\n   Domain-based
    service names are similar to host-based service names,\n   but using a domain
    name (not necessarily and Internat domain name)\n   instead of or in addition
    to a hostname.  The primary purpose of\n   domain-based service names is to provide
    a way to name clustered\n   services after the domain which they service, thereby
    allowing their\n   clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication
    of\n   their names.\n\t </p>\n      "
