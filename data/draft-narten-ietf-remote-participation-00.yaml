abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses some steps for improving the ability of people
    to remotely participate in IETF meetings. This document makes some recommendations
    of "best practice", that if adopted, could improve the ability for people to participate
    in IETF meetings without needing to physically attend meetings. Improving the
    ability of participants to contribute and participate remotely would improve the
    overall effectiveness of the IETF and improve the quality of the work it produces.</p>
