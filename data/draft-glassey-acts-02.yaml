abstract:
- content: "<p>The Automated Computer Time Service [ACTS] has been provided since
    1988 for public users who need to synchronize computer clocks to the correct time
    to a Federally Provided timesource for security, audit, or just general synchronization
    purposes. In the current evolving EC aware landscape, the source of time used
    in best computing practices is more and more important to the overall dependability
    of the trust model. This document then, is filed for historical purposes on the
    already widely used, publicly available ACTS time service protocol. [AWTT]</p>"
