abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using
    protocols\n   such as BSR or Auto-RP.  The BGP-MVPN specification provides for
    this\n   information to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel\n
    \  between the PEs in an MVPN environment.  Since this is control\n   information,
    it is desirable to signal this information in BGP\n   between PEs, similar to
    carrying other customer control state such as\n   C-Multicast routes.  This document
    specifies the mechanisms and\n   procedures to carry bootstrap information via
    BGP to provide true\n   control and data plane separation.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
