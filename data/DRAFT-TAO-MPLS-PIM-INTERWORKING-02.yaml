abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a framework for the inter-working between\n
    \  Protocol Independent Multicast [PIM] and a leaf-driven MPLS P2MP\n   tunnel
    signaling protocol so that multiple PIM sites around an MPLS\n   network can form
    a single PIM domain without compromising PIM's\n   features, scalability, and
    performance.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
