abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used\n   to
    distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing\n   system to
    propagate information regarding more specific components of\n   the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix (IPv4,\n   IPv6), MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses,
    and NV03 encapsulation of IP\n   addresses.  The information is carried via the
    BGP, thereby reusing\n   protocol algorithms, operational experience, and administrative\n
    \  processes such as inter-provider peering agreements.\n\n   This document provides
    the definition of a BGP NLRI which carries\n   traffic flow specification filters,
    and Extended Community values\n   which encode the actions a routing system can
    take if a packet\n   matches the traffic flow filters.  The specification requires
    that\n   the BGP Flow Specification traffic filters follows a string ordering,\n
    \  and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended Communities actions are\n   processed
    in a defined order.  This BGP Flow Specification is denoted\n   as BGP Flow Specification
    version 1.\n\n   There are three applications of that encoding format: 1) automation\n
    \  of inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is\n   required
    in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service\n   attacks; 2) enable traffic
    filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN\n   service, and 3) aid centralized
    control of traffic in a SDN or NFV\n   context.  Some of deployments of these
    three applications can be\n   handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic
    flow filters,\n   and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow\n
    \  Specification actions.  Other deployments (especially SDN/NFV) need\n   to
    be able to allow the user to order the flow specification.\n   Another BGP Flow
    Specification (version 2) is being defined for user-\n   ordered filters, and
    user-ordered actions encoded in Wide\n   Communities.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
