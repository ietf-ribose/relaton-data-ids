abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio\n
    \  technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks\n   based
    on CoAP.  The emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWA)\n   present a particular
    set of constraints, which places them at the\n   intersection of infrastructure
    networks, ultra-dense networks, delay-\n   tolerant networks and low-power and
    lossy networks.  The main\n   objectives of LPWA signaling is to minimize the
    number of exchanged\n   messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure
    and\n   extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of\n   technology-independence
    (L2-independence).  This document describes\n   the use of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) as the main\n   signaling protocol for LPWA, over which minimal
    messages are\n   exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as\n
    \  authentication, authorization, and management.  The use of CoAP\n   signaling
    provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to\n   different LPWA technologies.\n\n\t
