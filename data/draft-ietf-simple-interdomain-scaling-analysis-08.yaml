abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the traffic that is generated by presence subscriptions
    between domains and shows that the amount of traffic can be extremely large. This
    document also analyzes the effects of a large presence system on the memory footprint
    and the CPU load. Approved and in-work optimizations to the Session Initiation
    Protocol are analyzed, considering the possible impact on the load. Separate documents
    contain the requirements for optimizations and suggestions for new optimizations.</p>"
