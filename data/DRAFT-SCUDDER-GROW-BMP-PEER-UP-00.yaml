abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 7854, BMP, uses different message types for different purposes.\n
    \  Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV) structured.  One message\n   type,
    the Peer Up message, lacks a set of TLVs defined for its use,\n   instead sharing
    a namespace with the Initiation message.  Subsequent\n   experience has shown
    that this namespace sharing was a mistake, as it\n   hampers the extension of
    the protocol.\n\n   This document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent
    namespace\n   for the Peer Up message.  The changes in this document are formal\n
    \  only, compliant implementations of RFC 7854 also comply with this\n   specification.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
