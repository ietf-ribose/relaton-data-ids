abstract:
- content: "<p>Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process protocol
    headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits. When such packets
    are dropped, the sender receives no indication so it cannot take action to address
    the cause of discarded packets. This document defines ICMP errors that can be
    sent by a node that discards packets because it is unable to process the protocol
    headers. A node that receives such an ICMP error may be able to modify what it
    sends in future packets to avoid subsequent packet discards.</p>"
