abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Dynamic composing Web Services provides an efficient mechanism
    to \noffer complex large systems. Substantial progress has already been \nmade
    towards composing Web Services. Unfortunately, these approaches \ncannot build
    a model of the whole life cycle of composed Web Services. \nIn order to solve
    this problem, this draft designed a whole life cycle model named Service-Cloud
    model based on the forming picture of clouds \nin nature. Service-Cloud model
    can describe the whole life cycle of the composed web Services: discovery, compose,
    publish, and terminate.\n\t </p>\n      "
