abstract:
  content: "\t <t>With WLAN hotspots becoming more wide spread, there is growing interestamong
    cellular service providers in WLAN-Cellular interworking/roamingarchitectures.
    Service providers are looking at deployment ofinterworking heterogeneous wireless
    access points. There is also agrowing breed of terminals trying to build a capability
    to roam between 3G and 802.xx technologies. Working groups within IETF andIEEE
    802.21 are involved in defining seamless roaming standards.802.21 is attempting
    to define roaming standards not just from one802-based network to another, but
    also between 802-based networksand 3G cellular network. Support for handoff between
    heterogeneouswireless networks is becoming vital. Mobile IP has always been themacro
    network mobility protocol of choice where as the IAPP - InterAccess Point Protocol
    (802.11f) has been recommended as the roamingprotocol between 802.11 access points.This
    draft suggests a mechanism of supporting handoff between IAPPsupported 802.xx
    devices and 3G packet core networks.</p>"
