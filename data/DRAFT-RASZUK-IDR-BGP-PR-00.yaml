abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP protocol today contains number of build in mechanisms which\n
    \  record critical for its loop free operation data along the path of\n   BGP
    message propagation.  Those are encoded in AS_PATH, CLUSTER_LIST\n   or ORIGINATOR_ID
    attributes.  However in the same time there is no\n   provisioning to record other
    useful information along the path which\n   can be helpful to the operator in
    order to enhance end to end\n   visibility of BGP control plane.\n\n   In order
    to solve this problem this document proposes a new single\n   BGP attribute designed
    as an generic and extensible container to\n   carry number of new optional information
    corresponding to the BGP\n   speakers given BGP advertisement (or withdraw) message
    traverses.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
