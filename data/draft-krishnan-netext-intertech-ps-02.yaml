abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any
    mobility-related signaling. While the PMIPv6 protocol itself supports handover
    across interfaces and between access types, there are several issues with effectively
    performing inter-technology handovers with network based mobility protocols. This
    document aims to enumerate some known issues with such handovers.</p>"
