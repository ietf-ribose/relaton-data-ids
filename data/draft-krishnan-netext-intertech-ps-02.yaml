abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility managementprotocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring itsparticipation in any
    mobility-related signaling. While the PMIPv6protocol itself supports handover
    across interfaces and betweenaccess types, there are several issues with effectively
    performinginter-technology handovers with network based mobility protocols.This
    document aims to enumerate some known issues with suchhandovers.</p>"
