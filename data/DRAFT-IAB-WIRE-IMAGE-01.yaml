abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the wire image, an abstraction of the information
    available to an on-path non-participant in a networking protocol.  This abstraction
    is intended to shed light on the implications that increased encryption has for
    network functions that use the wire image.\n\t </p>\n      "
