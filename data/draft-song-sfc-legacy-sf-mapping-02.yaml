abstract:
- content: "<p>A Service Function Chain (SFC) goes through a list of ordered service
    functions. One assumption of this document is that legacy service function can
    participate in the service function chain, but they are not aware of the SFC header,
    nor interpret it. This document provides a mechanism between an SFC proxy and
    an SFC-unaware Service Function (i.e. legacy SF), to identify the SFC header associated
    with a packet that is returned from a legacy SF, without SFC header being explicitly
    carried in the wired protocol between SFC Proxy and legacy SF.</p>"
