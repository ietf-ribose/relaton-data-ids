abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliablecommunications
    channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar toTCP [RFC0793]. With the widespread
    deployment of Network AddressTranslators (NAT), specialized code has been added
    to NAT for TCPthat allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only
    asingle globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind aNAT) choose
    the same port numbers for their connection. Thisadditional code is sometimes classified
    as Network Address and PortTranslation or NAPT. To date, specialized code for
    SCTP has NOT yetbeen added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available. The
    endresult of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind aNAT.This document
    describes an SCTP specific chunks and procedures tohelp NAT's provide similar
    features of NAPT in the single point andmulti-point traversal scenario.</p>"
