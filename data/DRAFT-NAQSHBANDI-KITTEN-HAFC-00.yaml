abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies the problem of attack on authenticity
    users.\n   The problem is discussed with respect to fog computing environment.\n
    \  The threat exist when any user log in to access the service.\n   The two aspects
    are either the fog server is fake or the user node\n   is fake. The information
    stored on the server and transferred over\n   the connection. This information
    can be highly confidential and\n   sensitive. So to enhance security in this scenario,
    cloud server can\n   authenticate both the parties and establish the connection.
    There\n   are chances that it can get attacked and used by illegitimate users.\n
    \  Therefore, there was an utmost need to increase the security on\n   authentication
    of the users. This document discusses a novel\n   approach to overcome the problem
    by using a hybrid approach. The\n   technique is based on user authentication
    and fog authentication\n   by cloud server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
