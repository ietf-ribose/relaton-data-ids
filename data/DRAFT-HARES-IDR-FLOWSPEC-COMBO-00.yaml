abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution
    of\n   filters and actions that apply when packets are received on a router\n
    \  with the flow specification function turned on.  If one considers the\n   reception
    of the packet as an event, then BGP flow specification\n   describes a set of
    minimalistic Event-Match Condition-Action\n   policies.  The initial set of policy
    (RFC5575 and RFC7674) for this\n   policy includes 12 types of match filters encoded
    in the NLRI for two\n   types of SAFIs (IP-only SAFI, 133; VPN SAFI, 134) for
    IPv4.  The\n   popularity of these flow specification filters in deployment for
    DoS\n   and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more BGP flow\n   specification
    match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow\n   specification actions.\n\n   This
    document provides rules for combining new flow specification\n   packet ECA policies
    which support IPv6, L2, nvo03 and MPLS match\n   filters, and new actions.  This
    document also provides rules for the\n   interaction of IDR Flow Specification
    policy (session ephemeral\n   policy) with policy found in I2RS (reboot ephemeral
    policy), and\n   policy found in ACLs and Policy routing (configuration policy).\n\n\t
