abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.\nA
    recently proposed approach combines Diffserv and pre-congestion\nnotification
    (PCN) to provide a service slightly better than Intserv\ncontrolled load.  It
    scales to networks of any size, but only if\ndomains trust each other to comply
    with admission control and rate\npolicing.  This memo claims to solve this trust
    problem without\nlosing scalability.  It describes bulk border policing that provides\na
    sufficient emulation of per-flow policing with the help of another\nrecently proposed
    extension to ECN, involving re-echoing ECN feedback\n(re-ECN).  With only passive
    bulk measurements at borders, sanctions\ncan be applied against cheating networks.\n\t
