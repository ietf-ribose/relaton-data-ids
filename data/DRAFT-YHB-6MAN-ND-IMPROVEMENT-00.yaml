abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes the improvement to neighbor discovery.
    When\n   an IPv6 address is deleted on a node, the node will send a neighbor \n
    \  advertisement with a \"Deleted\" flag set to all link-local nodes.\n   If the
    IPv6 address has been configured on another node, and it is\n   in duplicate state,
    it will perform DAD(Duplicate Address Detection)\n   again. If DAD succeeds, the
    IPv6 address will be assigned to the  \n   node.\n   If the IPv6 address exists
    in the neighbor cache on the other nodes,\n   when the neighbor advertisement
    with deleted flag set arrived, they \n   know the neighbor is unreachable and
    delete the neighbor cache entry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
