abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
    for hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device identity
    can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage
    or in equipment inventories.  A URN-based representation can be passed along in
    applications that need the information.\n\t </p>\n      "
