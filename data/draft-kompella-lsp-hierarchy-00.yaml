abstract:
  content: "\t <t>To improve scalability of MPLS TE it may be useful to aggregate
    TELSPs. The aggregation is accomplished by (a) an LSR creating a TELSP, (b) the
    LSR forming a forwarding adjacency out of that LSP(advertising this LSP as a link
    into ISIS/OSPF), (c) allowing otherLSRs to use forwarding adjacencies for their
    path computation, and(d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into that LSP
    (by usingthe label stack construct).This document describes the mechanisms to
    accomplish this.</p>"
