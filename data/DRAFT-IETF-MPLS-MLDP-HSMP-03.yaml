abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (or
    HSMP LSP for\n   short), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP
    LSP\n   and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means\n
    \  traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root\n   node
    travels downstream to each leaf node, exactly as if it is\n   travelling downstream
    along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node.  Upstream\n   traffic entering the HSMP LSP
    at any leaf node travels upstream along\n   the tree to the root, as if it is
    unicast to the root, and strictly\n   follows the downstream path of the tree
    rather than routing protocol\n   based unicast path to the root.\n\n\n\t </p>\n
