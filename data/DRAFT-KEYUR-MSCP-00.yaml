abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes an approach for solving the 'last-mile'
    problem\nfor multicast, especially SSM-style multicast, called Multicast Signaling
    Conduit Protocol (MSCP). It is intended to facilitate an endnode whose OS does
    not support IGMPv3, or who resides in a portion of the Internet infrastructure
    without multicast, to join multicast groups. It is especially intended for SSM-style
    groups, although it could be adapted for use for other multicast groups.\n\t </p>\n
