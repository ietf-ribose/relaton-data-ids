abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   With the technology advancements in the field of containers,
    they\n   are considered a potential alternative to virtual machine based\n   implementations.
    In the area of cloud applications, there are\n   comprehensive studies and early
    implementations of container based\n   platforms. This draft describes some of
    the challenges of using\n   virtual machines for NFV workloads and how containers
    can\n   potentially address these challenges.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
