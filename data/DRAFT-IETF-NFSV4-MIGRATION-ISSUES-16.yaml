abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document discusses a range of implementation and specification\n
    \  issues concerning features related to the use of location-related\n   attributes
    in NFSv4.  These include migration, which transfers\n   responsibility for a file
    system from one server to another, and\n   trunking which deals with the discovery
    and control of the set of\n   server endpoints to use to access a file system.
    \ The focus of the\n   discussion, which relates to multiple minor versions, is
    on defining\n   the appropriate clarifications and corrections for existing\n
    \  specifications.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
