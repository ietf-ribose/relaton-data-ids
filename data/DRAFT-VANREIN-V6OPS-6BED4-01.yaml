abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The intention of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications,
    even on\n   IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-\n
    \  peer protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat\n   session.
    \ Such protocols are designed to run in any environment,\n   which means that
    they cannot rely on IPv6 for themselves, or their\n   peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel
    mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be assumed\n   on all peers, without a need to
    configure it explicitly.\n\n   The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback mechanism
    for IPv6\n   connectivity on networks that do not support it natively, by running\n
    \  a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used to support\n   traceability
    of the traffic originator, which means that no user\n   account or other configuration
    is needed.\n\n   The tunnel mechanism builds on existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs\n
    \  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6\n   address
    on a 6bed4 Peer, and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the\n   most direct
    route to a remote 6bed4 Peer.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
