abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The UUCP Mapping Project started in the early 1980s as a means
    to\nfacilitate the exchange of electronic mail among sites using the UUCP\nstore-and-forward
    transport mechanism. This UUCP software, originally\npart of the UNIX operating
    system became available on a variety of\noperating systems and platforms, from
    large mainframe to small home\nPC's. This was done by creating a single database
    of systems\nconnected to each other via UUCP and then using path building\nsoftware
    (such as pathalias) to determine the optimal path from one\nsystem to another.
    Email addresses using this system incorporated the\nuse of the path as part of
    the address.\n\t </p>\n      "
