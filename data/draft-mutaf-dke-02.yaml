abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which
    ashort fingerprint is used to represent a \"one-time\" public keyfingerprint.
    The one-time public key is immediately used for keyexchange, before an attacker
    has time to find a public/private keypair that gives the same fingerprint and
    mount a Man-in-the-Middleattack. The protocol, however, requires that both users
    be presentfor fingerprint verification, making it suitable for mobile usersonly.</p>"
