abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which a short
    fingerprint is used to represent a "one-time" public key fingerprint. The one-time
    public key is immediately used for key exchange, before an attacker has time to
    find a public/private key pair that gives the same fingerprint and mount a Man-in-the-Middle
    attack. The protocol, however, requires that both users be present for fingerprint
    verification, making it suitable for mobile users only.</p>
