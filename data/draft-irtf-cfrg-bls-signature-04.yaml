abstract:
- content: "<p>BLS is a digital signature scheme with aggregation properties. Given
    set of signatures (signature_1, ..., signature_n) anyone can produce an aggregated
    signature. Aggregation can also be done on secret keys and public keys. Furthermore,
    the BLS signature scheme is deterministic, non-malleable, and efficient. Its simplicity
    and cryptographic properties allows it to be useful in a variety of use- cases,
    specifically when minimal storage space or bandwidth are required.</p>"
