abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched\n   optical
    networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs\n   under a number of
    conditions including: (a) when optional\n   processing, such as regeneration,
    must be configured to occur at\n   specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment
    must be configured\n   to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or
    (c) where\n   equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with\n
    \  specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to\n   support
    distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,\n   and choice in distributed
    wavelength assignment algorithms. These\n   extensions build on previous work
    for the control of lambda and\n   G.709 based networks.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
