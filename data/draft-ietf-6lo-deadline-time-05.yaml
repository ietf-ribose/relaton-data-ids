abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new type for the 6LoWPAN routing header containing
    the deadline time for data packets, designed for use over constrained networks.
    The deadline time enables forwarding and scheduling decisions for time-critical
    machine-to-machine (M2M) applications running on Internet-enabled devices that
    operate within time-synchronized networks. This document also specifies a representation
    for the deadline time values in such networks.</p>"
