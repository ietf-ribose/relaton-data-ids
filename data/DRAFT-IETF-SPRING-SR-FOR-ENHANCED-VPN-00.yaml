abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.
    \ A node\n   steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called\n
    \  \"segments\".  A segment can represent topological or service based\n   instructions.
    \ A segment can further be associated with a set of\n   network resources used
    for executing the instruction.  Such a segment\n   is called resource-aware segment.\n\n
    \  Resource-aware Segment Identifiers (SIDs) may be used to build SR\n   paths
    with a set of reserved network resources.  In addition, a group\n   of resource-aware
    SIDs may be used to build SR based virtual underlay\n   networks, which has customized
    network topology and resource\n   attributes required by one or a group of customers
    and/or services.\n   Such virtual networks are the SR instantiations of Virtual
    Transport\n   Networks (VTNs).\n\n   This document describes a suggested use of
    resource-aware SIDs to\n   build SR based VTNs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
