abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   To improve network resource utilization and reduce operational\n
    \  expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation concept is\n   defined
    in Broadband Forum TR-384.  This document describes the\n   information model
    for the interface between the Control-Plane (CP)\n   and the User-Plane (UP) in
    the CP/UP separation BNG.  This\n   information model may involve both the control
    channel interface and\n   the configuration channel interface.  The interface
    for the control\n   channel allows the Control-Plane to send flow tables to the
    User-\n   Plane, such as user's information table, user's interface table, and\n
    \  user's QoS table.  And it also allows the User-Plane to report\n   resource
    and statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The\n   interface for the configuration
    channel is in charge of the protocol\n   version negotiation between the Control-Plane
    and User-Plane, the\n   configuration for devices of the Control-Plane and User-Plane,
    and\n   the reports of User-Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information model\n
    \  defined in this document supports defining a standardized data model.\n   Such
    a data model can be used to specify an interface to the CU\n   separation BNG.\n\n\t
