abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The changing structure and size of today's Internet has taxed
    the \nexisting name services and their architecture to the breaking \npoint. The
    DNS system of today was unfortunately architected to \nhave a single root zone
    and limited set of Top Level Domains. This \nis defined usually in the set of
    root servers any resolving \nrequest uses to lookup an address. \n\nThis proposal
    then is an attempt to lessen the impact on end-users \nand registrars and to allow
    IP owners a greater freedom in \nrepresenting namespace to their customers. \n\nThe
    elevator description is that this I-D proposes the \nrestructuring of domain names
    more fully along the lines of a \ntelephone number by creating a ROOT ZONE PROTOCOL
    as an addition \nto multiply the existing DNS services times the number of ROOT
    \nZONES.\n\t </p>\n      "
