abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on
    the path\n   between the DNS client and its server.  These queries and responses\n
    \  can contain privacy-sensitive information which is valuable to\n   protect.
    \ An active attacker can send bogus responses causing\n   misdirection of the
    subsequent connection.\n\n   To counter passive listening and active attacks,
    this document\n   proposes the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    for DNS,\n   to protect against passive listeners and certain active attacks.
    \ As\n   DNS needs to remain fast, this proposal also discusses mechanisms to\n
    \  reduce DTLS round trips and reduce DTLS handshake size.  The proposed\n   mechanism
    runs over the default DNS port and can also run over an\n   alternate port.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
