abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
    to\n   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network
    related information.  This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions,
    for example when selecting a target host from a\n   set of candidates.\n\n   Therefore
    an ALTO server provides network and cost maps to its\n   clients.  This draft
    discusses options on how to provide incremental\n   updates for these maps, with
    the goal of reducing the amount of data\n   needed for transmitting the maps and
    shortly evaluates the two most\n   promising options.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
