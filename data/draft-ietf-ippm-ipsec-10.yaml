abstract:
- content: "<p>The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanisms require that both the client
    and server endpoints possess a shared secret. This document describes the use
    of keys derived from an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the shared key in O/TWAMP.
    If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, O/TWAMP can support certificate-based
    key exchange, which would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency.
    The key derivation presented in this document can also facilitate automatic key
    management.</p>"
