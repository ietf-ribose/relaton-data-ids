abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates RFC 4733 to add event codes for telephony signals
    used for channel-associated signalling when carried in the telephony event RTP
    payload. It supersedes and adds to the original assignment of event codes for
    this purpose in Section 3.14 of RFC 2833. As documented in Appendix A of RFC 4733,
    some of the RFC 2833 events have been deprecated because their specification was
    ambiguous, erroneous, or redundant. In fact, the degree of change from Section
    3.14 of RFC 2833 is such that implementations of the present document will be
    fully backward compatible with RFC 2833 implementations only in the case of full
    ABCD-bit signalling. This document expands and improves the coverage of signalling
    systems compared to RFC 2833. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
