abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) to create multiple independent and survivable network overlays that are
    interconnected by a transit overlay. The transit overlay is referred to as the
    "uberlay" and provides connectivity and control plane abstraction between overlays.
    Structuring the network into multiple network overlays allows each overlay to
    scale independently. The different network overlays are autonomous from a control
    and data plane perspective to enable failure survivability across overlays. The
    hierarchical structure of the multi-overlay network interconnected by an uberlay
    provides optimizations to the forwarding of unicast traffic as well as the replication
    of multicast traffic in both the overlay and underlay. This document specifies
    the mechanisms and procedures for the distribution of control plane information
    across overlay sites and in the uberlay as well as the lookup and forwarding procedures
    for unicast and multicast traffic within and across overlays. The specification
    also defines the procedures to support inter-overlay mobility of EIDs and their
    integration with the intra-overlay EID mobility procedures defined in draft-ietf-lisp-eid-mobility.</p>
