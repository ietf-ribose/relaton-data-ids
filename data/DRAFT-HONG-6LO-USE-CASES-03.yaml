abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained\n
    \  node networks (6lo) and use cases.  It describes the practical\n   deployment
    scenarios of 6lo technologies with the consideration of\n   6lo link layer technologies
    and identifies the requirements.  In\n   addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various link
    layer technologies such as\n   ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), BLE, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC,
    LTE MTC, and IEEE\n   802.15.4e(6tisch) are widely used at constrained node networks
    for\n   typical services.  Based on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over\n
    \  networks of resource-constrained nodes has various and practical use\n   cases.
    \ To efficiently implement typical services, the applicability\n   and consideration
    of several design space dimensions are described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
