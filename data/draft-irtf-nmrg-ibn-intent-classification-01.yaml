abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to operate
    the network. Intent management system includes an interface for users to input
    requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration
    and manage their life-cycle. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed definition,
    interface or model of intent. This document discusses mostly the concept of network
    intents, but other types of intents are also being considered. Specifically, it
    highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and encode
    intent, the associated intent taxonomy, and defines relevant intent terms where
    necessary. This document provides a foundation for intent related research and
    facilitate solution development.</p>"
