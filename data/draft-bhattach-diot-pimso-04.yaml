abstract:
  content: "<p>This document considers the requirements for implementing PIM Source-Only
    (PIM-SO) which will allow the creation of source-based multicasttrees across multiple
    domains in the Internet. PIM-SO realizes theEXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service
    model in which there is a singlesource for every multicast group, and group membership
    and addressingis based on a multicast group address (G) as well as the source'sunicast
    address (S). Our short-term goal is to implement PIM-SO withminimal changes to
    the current multicast routing infrastructure byAugust 2000, and to provide proof
    of concept by deploying it onSprintlab's experimental network. By the end of the
    year, we envisagethat PIM-SO will be ready to be incorporated in Sprint's multicastbackbone
    as a commercial point-to-multipoint service.</p>"
