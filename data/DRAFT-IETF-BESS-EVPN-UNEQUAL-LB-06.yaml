abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In an EVPN-IRB based network overlay, EVPN all-active multi-homing\n
    \  enables multi-homing for a CE device connected to two or more PEs via\n   a
    LAG, such that bridged and routed traffic from remote PEs can be\n   equally load
    balanced (ECMPed) across the multi-homing PEs.  This\n   document defines extensions
    to EVPN procedures to optimally handle\n   unequal access bandwidth distribution
    across a set of multi-homing\n   PEs in order to:\n\n   o  provide greater flexibility,
    with respect to adding or removing\n      individual PE-CE links within the access
    LAG.\n\n   o  handle PE-CE LAG member link failures that can result in unequal\n
    \     PE-CE access bandwidth across a set of multi-homing PEs.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
