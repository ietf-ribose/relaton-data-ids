abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document presents an applicability of existing MPLS protection\n
    \  mechanisms, both local and end-to-end, to Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching
    Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in ring topologies.  Protection\n   on rings offers
    a number of opportunities for optimization as the\n   protection choices are starkly
    limited (all traffic traveling one way\n   around a ring can only be switched
    to travel the other way on the\n   ring), but also suffers from some complications
    caused by the\n   limitations of the topology.\n\n   Requirements for MPLS-TP
    protection especially for protection in ring\n   topologies are discussed in \"Requirements
    of an MPLS Transport\n   Profile\" (RFC 5654) and \"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\n
    \  Survivability Framework\" (RFC 6372).  This document shows how MPLS-TP\n   linear
    protection as defined in RFC 6378 can be applied to single\n   ring topologies,
    discusses how most of the requirements are met, and\n   describes scenarios in
    which the function provided by applying linear\n   protection in a ring topology
    falls short of some of the\n   requirements.\n\n   This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
    an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined
    by the ITU-T.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
