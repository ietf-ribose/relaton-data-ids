abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document addresses how to securely achieve the nested tunnels
    \noptimization using nested path information that reflects the \noptimized path
    from Top Level Mobile Router(TLMR) to Mobile \nRouter(MR) in nested mobile networks.
    \ The solution is based on \nReverse Routing Header(RRH) idea and the concern
    of security problem in RRH. By carefully taking a look at the simplicity of \nRouting
    Header Type 2 routing mechanism and the complexity of \nAccess Router Option(ARO)
    based solution to get rid of the threat \nof possible attack for RRH, the proposed
    solution has been \nconsidered to preserve the efficiency of RRH without the lack
    of \nsecurity. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
