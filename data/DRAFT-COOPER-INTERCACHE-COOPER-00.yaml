abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo is aimed at implementors of caching proxies using\nHTTP/1.1[1]
    and ICPv2[2]. It describes small extensions to these\nprotocols which are intended
    to aid the inter-operation of caching\nproxies. These extensions provide debug
    facilities, optimizations\nfor ICP reply messages, and the ability to request
    object purge\noperations.\n\t </p>\n      "
