abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines extensions to BGP-LS protocol in order to advertise
    Network Resource Partition SR segments that share the same IGP computed forwarding
    path but offer a forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling and drop policy) that is
    associated with a specific Network Resource. The draft is applicable to both SR-MPLS
    and SRv6 dataplanes</p>"
