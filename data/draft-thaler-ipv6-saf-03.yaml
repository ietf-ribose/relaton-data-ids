abstract:
  content: "\t <t>There are various recent proposals that would result in IPv6translation
    becoming permanent. RFC 3424 discusses UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF)
    mechanisms which are required for applicationsto work with most translation schemes,
    points out a number ofproblems with them, and requires an exit strategy for any
    UNSAFmechanism. This document discusses an alternative to UNSAFmechanisms should
    IPv6 translation become permanent.</p>"
