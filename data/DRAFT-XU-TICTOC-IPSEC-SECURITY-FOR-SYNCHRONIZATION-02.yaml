abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Cellular networks often use Internet standard technologies
    to handle\n   synchronization.  This document defines an extension based on WESP.\n
    \  Usually, several traffic flows are carried in one IPsec tunnel, for\n   some
    applications, such as, 1588 or NTP, the packets need to be\n   identified after
    IPsec encryption to handle specially.  In order to\n   achieve high scalability
    in implement, a separate IPsec tunnel will\n   not be established for some special
    traffic.  This document analyses\n   the need for security methods for synchronization
    messages\n   distributed over the Internet.  This document also gives a solution\n
    \  on how to mark the synchronization message when IPSec is implemented\n   in
    end to end frequency synchronization.\"\n\n\t </p>\n      "
