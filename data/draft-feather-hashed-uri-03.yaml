abstract:
- content: "<p>There are situations where it is desirable to determine whether two
    URIs are identical without revealing the value of one or the other if they are
    not. For example, the publisher of filtering software may want to provide a set
    of URLs to be filtered without identifying the actual resources in question. This
    problem has traditionally been done using cryptographically secure hashes. The
    two items are both hashed and the resulting values then compared. If they are
    equal it can be assumed that the two original items were equal as well; if not,
    the hash does not reveal anything about the original item. This technique is eminently
    suitable for this situation. This document describes a 'hashed' URI naming scheme
    for representing the hashed form of a URI [RFC2396] as another URI.</p>"
