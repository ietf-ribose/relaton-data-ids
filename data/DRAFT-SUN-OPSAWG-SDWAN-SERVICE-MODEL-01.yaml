abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a SD-WAN VPN service model to enable
    a Service\n   Provider to deliver SD-WAN VPN services to its customers by\n   provisioning
    the CE devices on behalf of the customer.  This document\n   is based on provider-provisioned
    CE-based VPNs as described in\n   [RFC4110].\n\n   This model provides an abstracted
    view of the SD-WAN VPN service\n   configuration components, and is intended to
    be instantiated at the\n   management system to deliver the overall service.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
