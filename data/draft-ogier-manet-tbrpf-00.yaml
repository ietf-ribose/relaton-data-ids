abstract:
  content: "<p>Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is alink-state
    routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hocnetwork (MANET) or an internet.
    TBRPF provides each node with thestate of each link in the network, but does so
    much more efficientlythan flooding (e.g., OSPF). TBRPF uses the concept of reverse-pathforwarding
    to efficiently and reliably broadcast each link-stateupdate along the minimum-hop-path
    tree rooted at the source of theupdate. The broadcast trees (one tree per source)
    are updateddynamically using the topology information that is received along thetrees
    themselves, thus requiring very little additional overhead formaintaining the
    trees. This document describes TBRPF and discussesdetails for the implementation
    of TBRPF in IPv4-based MANETs.</p>"
