abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a PCE based link state conflict avoidance mechanism.
    Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute a network path or route based on the
    information stored in Traffic Engineering Database (TED) and TED collects the
    link resources information through the OSPF-TE protocol. The proposed conflict
    avoidance mechanism gives each link two state which respectively represents the
    resource in this link is changed or not. The extended OSPF-TE protocol will also
    flood the link state information when it floods the link resources information.
    PCE will add the link state to the calculated path when it returns the calculated
    path to Path Computation Clients (PCC). When the RSVP-TE protocol reserves the
    resource along the calculated path, it will compare the link state stored in the
    calculated path with the link state stored in the local. If the link state between
    the calculated path and the local is inconsistent then the RSVP-TE protocol will
    stop the resource reservation process, release the reserved resource and promote
    the OSPF-TE protocol to flood the Link resources information immediately.</p>"
