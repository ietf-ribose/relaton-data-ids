abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Shared mesh protection allows a set of diversely routed paths
    with\n   diverse endpoints to collectively oversubcribe protection resources.\n
    \  Under normal conditions no single failure will result in the capacity\n   of
    the associated protection resources to be exhausted.\n\n   When multiple failures
    occur such that more than one path in the set\n   of paths utilizing shared protection
    resources is affected, the\n   necessity arises of pre-empting traffic on the
    basis of business\n   priority rather than application priority.\n\n   This memo
    describes the use of SPMEs and TC marking as a means of\n   indicating business
    priority for shared mesh protection.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
