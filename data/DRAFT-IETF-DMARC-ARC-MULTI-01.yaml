abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism\n
    \  whereby a series of handlers of an email message can conduct\n   authentication
    of the email message as it passes among them on the\n   way to its destination.\n\n
    \  Initial development of ARC has been done with a single allowed\n   signing
    algorithm, but parallel work in the DCRUP working group\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/)
    is expanding the\n   supported algorithms.  This specification defines how to
    extend ARC\n   for multiple signing algorithms.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
