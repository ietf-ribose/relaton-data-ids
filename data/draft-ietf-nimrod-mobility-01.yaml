abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss the issue of mobility in Nimrod. While a mobility solution
    is not part of the Nimrod architecture, Nimrod does require that the solution
    have certain characteristics. We identify the requirements that Nimrod has of
    any solution for mobility support. We also classify and compare existing approaches
    for supporting mobility within an internetwork and discuss their advantages and
    disadvantages. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This
    memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
