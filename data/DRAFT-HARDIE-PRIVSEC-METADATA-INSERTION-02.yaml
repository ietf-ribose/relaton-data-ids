abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations
    of\n   pervasive attack on Internet communications.  In this document we\n   consider
    the implications of protocol designs which associate\n   metadata with encrypted
    flows.\n   In particular, we assert that designs which do so by explicit actions\n
    \  of the end system are preferable to  designs in which middleboxes\n   insert
    them.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
