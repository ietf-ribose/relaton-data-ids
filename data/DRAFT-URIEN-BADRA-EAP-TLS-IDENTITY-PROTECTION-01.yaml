abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a mechanism that ensures EAP-TLS identity
    \n   protection. The main idea is to encrypt the client's certificate. \n    \n
    \  Three procedures are proposed in order to determine the certificate \n   encryption
    mechanism, \n    \n   - Implicit, the client's certificate is encrypted according
    to a \n   pre-defined algorithm, deduced from the server's certificate. \n    \n
    \  - Notified, the EAP-identity response message, delivered by the \n   client
    includes information that precise the encryption algorithm to \n   be used. \n
    \   \n   - Negotiated, the client indicates a list of encryption algorithm, \n
    \  the server chooses one of them, and indicates its choice. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
