abstract:
- content: "<p>This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate
    Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport. This profile, called
    Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate
    management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need
    to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates.
    It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs
    generated by the CA.</p>"
