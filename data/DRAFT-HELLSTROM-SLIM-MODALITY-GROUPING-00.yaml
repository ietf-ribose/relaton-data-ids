abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   When setting up a real-time communication session, there may
    be a\n   need to indicate priority for which media to use for language\n   communications
    or a need to indicate preference for receiving the\n   same language content simultaneously
    in two modalities.  This\n   document defines the semantics for grouping media
    for such purposes\n   in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics
    defined in\n   this document are based on the SDP Grouping Framework.  Applications\n
    \  are for example negotiation the most suitable common modality or\n   modalities
    for language communications in a real-time session.  The\n   indications are specified
    for the sending and receiving direction\n   separately.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
