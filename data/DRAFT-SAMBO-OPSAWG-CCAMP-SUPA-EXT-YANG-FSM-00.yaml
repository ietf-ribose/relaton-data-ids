abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Network operators and service providers are facing the challenge
    of\n   deployment of systems from different vendors while looking for a\n   trade-off
    among transmission performance, network device reuse, and\n   capital expenditure
    without the need of being tied to single vendor\n   equipment.  The deployment
    and operation of more dynamic and\n   programmable transport optical network infrastructures
    can be driven\n   by adopting model-driven and software-defined control and management\n
    \  paradigms.  In this context, YANG enables to compile a set of\n   consistent
    vendor-neutral data models for optical networks and\n   components based on actual
    operational needs emerging from\n   heterogeneous use cases.  This document extends
    YANG from data to\n   functional modeling in order to describe events, operations,
    and\n   finite state machine of YANG-defined network elements.  The proposed\n
    \  models can be applied in the context of optical networks to pre-\n   instruct
    data plane devices (e.g., an optical transponder) on the\n   actions to be performed
    (e.g., code adaptation) in case some events,\n   such as physical layer degradations,
    occur.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
