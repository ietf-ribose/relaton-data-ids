abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This is the second release of iTIP.  After having learned from\n
    \  RFC-2446 where most of this text comes from.  This document\n   represents
    the common objects needed for basic calendaring.  The\n   VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE,
    recurrence rules (RDATE remains), and\n   scheduling and their associated properties
    have been removed.  These\n   removals are expected to appear in new memos at
    a later time and will\n   be independent extensions of this specification.  The
    new EXTENSIONS\n   property will exist to allow for compatible sets of extensions.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
