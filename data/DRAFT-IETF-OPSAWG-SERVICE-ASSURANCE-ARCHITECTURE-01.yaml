abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an architecture for Service Assurance
    for\n   Intent-based Networking (SAIN).  This architecture aims at assuring\n
    \  that service instances are running as expected.  As services rely\n   upon
    multiple sub-services provided by the underlying network devices\n   and functions,
    getting the assurance of a healthy service is only\n   possible with a holistic
    view of all involved elements.  This\n   architecture not only helps to correlate
    the service degradation with\n   the network root cause but also the impacted
    services when a network\n   component fails or degrades.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
