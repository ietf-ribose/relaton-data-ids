abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP)
    tomanage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public KeyInfrastructure
    (RPKI). It is common to allow an RP to import TAmaterial in the form of self-signed
    certificates. The facilitydescribed in this document allows an RP to impose constraints
    on suchTAs. Because this mechanism is designed to operate in the RPKIcontext,
    the relevant constraints are the RFC 3779 extensions thatbind address spaces and/or
    autonomous system (AS) numbers toentities. The primary motivation for this facility
    is to enable an RPto ensure that resource allocation information that it has acquiredvia
    some trusted channel is not overridden by the informationacquired from the RPKI
    repository system or by the putative TAs thatthe RP imports. Specifically, the
    mechanism allows an RP to specify aset of bindings between public key identifiers
    and RFC 3779 extensiondata and will override any conflicting bindings expressed
    via theputative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the RPKI repositorysystem.
    Although this mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,an entity that is accorded
    administrative control over a set of RPsmay use this mechanism to convey its view
    of the RPKI to a set of RPswithin its jurisdiction. The means by which this latter
    use case iseffected is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
