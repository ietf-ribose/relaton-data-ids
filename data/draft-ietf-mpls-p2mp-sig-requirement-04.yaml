abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of requirements for the establishment
    and maintenance of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic-Engineered (TE) Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). There is no intent to specify
    solution-specific details or application-specific requirements in this document.
    The requirements presented in this document not only apply to packet-switched
    networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but also encompass the requirements
    of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port
    switching networks managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols. Protocol solutions
    developed to meet the requirements set out in this document must attempt to be
    equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
