abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies,
    and\n   hierarchical switching within a technology.  GMPLS routing and\n   signaling
    use common values to indicate switching technology type.\n   These values are
    carried in routing in the Switching Capability\n   field, and in signaling in
    the Switching Type field. While the\n   values used in these fields are the primary
    indicators of the\n   technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values
    are\n   not consistently defined and used across the different\n   technologies
    supported by GMPLS.  This document is intended to\n   resolve the inconsistent
    definition and use of the Switching\n   Capability and Type fields by narrowly
    scoping the meaning and use\n   of the fields.  This document updates any document
    that uses the\n   GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFC\n
    \  3471, RFC 4202, RFC 4203, and RFC 5307.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
