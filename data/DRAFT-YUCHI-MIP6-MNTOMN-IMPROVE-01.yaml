  content: "\n\t <p>Any node communicating with a mobile node in Mobile IPv6 is referred
    \nto as a \"correspondent node\" of the mobile node, and may itself be \neither
    a stationary node or a mobile node. Communication between \nmobile nodes has additional

    between mobile nodes. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
