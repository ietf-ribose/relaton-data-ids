abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo describes a protocol framework for HTTP clients to
    obtain\n   bearer tokens for accessing restricted resources, where in some\n   applications
    the client may not have prior knowledge of, or a direct\n   relationship with,
    the resource server's authorization infrastructure\n   (such as in decentralized
    identity systems).  Semi-concrete\n   applications of the framework using proof-of-possession
    and TLS\n   client certificate mechanisms are also described.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
