abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft describes a simple, incremental, network-based protocol
    to\nimplement separation of Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers\n(EIDs)
    and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  This mechanism requires no\nchanges to host stacks
    and no major changes to existing database\ninfrastructures.  The proposed protocol
    can be implemented in a\nrelatively small number of routers.\n\nThis proposal
    was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the\nAmsterdam IAB Routing and
    Addressing Workshop (RAWS), which took\nplace in October 2006.\n\t </p>\n      "
