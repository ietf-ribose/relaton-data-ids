abstract:
- content: "<p>Providing a Standard method for Addition of regional Advertisements
    in the IP Multicast Video Streaming is very important , because the equipment
    deployed would most likely be from different vendors across a multicast network.
    The idea is to introduce a special kind of Enhanced IGMP Ad-Insert control packet,
    which is passed from the multicast source to intermediate routers and which indicates
    that the source is going to stop sending multicast traffic for a particular group
    for specified time and the Regional center can utilize this time to insert its
    regional advertisement.</p>"
