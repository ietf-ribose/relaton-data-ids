abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet draft investigates the management aspects associated
    with packet-based distribution of time and frequency using protocols such as PTP
    (Precision Time Protocol, [1]). It explores some of the issues that need to be
    solved in connection with the management of synchronization distribution.</p>"
