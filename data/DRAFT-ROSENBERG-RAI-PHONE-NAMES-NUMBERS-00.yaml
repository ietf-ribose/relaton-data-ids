abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is often used for the
    purposes\n   of making and receiving Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, and in many of\n
    \  these cases one or both parties in the call is on the Public Switched\n   Telephone
    Network (PSTN).  For this reason, phone numbers are often\n   used as part of
    SIP calls.  Despite numerous small specifications\n   describing usage of phone
    numbers for SIP, there remains a great deal\n   of interoperability problems and
    feature loss.  This document tries\n   to address this by providing a general
    framework for the usage of\n   phone numbers and phone naming and numbering services
    with SIP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
