abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some working groups of the IETF and other Standards Developing\n
    \  Organizations are now discussing use cases of a technology that\n   enables
    data packets to traverse appropriate service functions\n   through networks.  This
    is called Service Chaining in this document.\n   (Also, in Network Functions Virtualisation
    (NFV), a subject that\n   forwarding packets to required service functions in
    appropriate order\n   is called VNF Forwarding Graph.)  This draft does not focus
    only on\n   SFC method, and thus, use the term \"Service Chaining\".  SFC may
    be\n   one method to realize Service Chaining.  There are several Service\n   Chaining
    methods to forward data packets to service functions, and\n   the applicable methods
    will vary depending on the service/network\n   requirements of individual networks.\n\n
    \  This document presents the results of analyzing packet forwarding\n   methods
    and path decision patterns for achieving Service Chaining.\n   For forwarding
    data packets to the appropriate service functions,\n   distribution of route infromation
    and steering data packets following\n   the route infromation, are required.  Examples
    of route information\n   are packet identifier and the routing configurations
    based on the\n   identifier.  Also, forwarding functions are required to decide
    the\n   path according to the route information.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
