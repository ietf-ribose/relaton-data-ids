abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,\n
    \  video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications\n   are
    often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control\n   is not implemented
    in the applications, then network congestion will\n   deteriorate the user's multimedia
    experience.  This document does not\n   propose a congestion control algorithm;
    rather, it defines a minimal\n   set of \"circuit-breakers\".  Circuit-breakers
    are conditions under\n   which an RTP flow is expected to stop transmiting media
    to protect\n   the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that all
    RTP\n   applications running on best-effort networks will be able to run\n   without
    triggering these circuit breakers in normal operation.  Any\n   future RTP congestion
    control specification is expected to operate\n   within the envelope defined by
    these circuit breakers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
