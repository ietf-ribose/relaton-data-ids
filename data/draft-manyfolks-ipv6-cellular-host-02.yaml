abstract:
  content: "\t <t>As an increasing number of cellular hosts are being connected to
    theInternet, IPv6 becomes necessary. Examples of such hosts are GPRS,UMTS, and
    CDMA2000 terminals. Standardization organizations are alsomaking IPv6 mandatory
    in their newest specifications, such as the IPmultimedia terminals specified for
    UMTS. However, the concept ofIPv6 covers many aspects, numerous RFCs, a number
    of differentsituations, and is also partly still evolving.</p>"
