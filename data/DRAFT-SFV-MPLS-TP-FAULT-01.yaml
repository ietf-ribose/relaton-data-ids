abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive\nconditions
    for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths\n(LSPs).  The notification
    mechanism employs a generic method for a\nservice disruptive condition to be communicated
    to a Maintenance End\nPoint (MEP).  An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance\n(OAM)
    channel is defined along with messages to communicate various\ntypes of service
    disruptive conditions.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted
