abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a canonical string object or 'token'
    for\n   verifying with non-repudiation the author of the token, their\n   authority
    to author the token and, minimally, the asserted\n   originating identity or persona
    contained within the token\n   corresponding specifically to the originator of
    'personal\n   communications', or any signalled communications between a set of\n
    \  parties with identities.  A cryptographic signature is defined to\n   protect
    the integrity of the information used to identify the\n   originator of a personal
    communications session (e.g. the telephone\n   number or URI) and verify the assertion
    of the identity information\n   at the destination.  The cryptographic signature
    is defined with the\n   intention that it can confidently verify the originating
    persona even\n   when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure\n
    \  channel.  The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly\n   useful
    for many personal communications applications over IP networks\n   and other multi-hop
    interconnection scenarios where the originating\n   and destination parties may
    not have a direct trusted relationship.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
