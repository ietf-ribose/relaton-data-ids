abstract:
  content: "<p>JUNOScript is an XML-based API for managing devices. It allowsaccess
    to both operational and configuration data using a simple RPCmechanism. Sessions
    can be established using a variety ofconnection-oriented access methods. This
    document describes theframing protocol, message content, and capabilities of this
    API.Design decisions and motivations are also discussed. No attempt ismade to
    formally define a protocol, but rather to document thecapabilities of JUNOScript
    as part of the discussion of XML-basednetwork management.</p>"
