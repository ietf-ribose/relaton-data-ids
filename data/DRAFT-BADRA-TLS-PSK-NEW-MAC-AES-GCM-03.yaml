abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for
    \nTransport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites \nuse SHA-1
    as their MAC algorithm.  This document describes a set of \ncipher suites for
    TLS/DTLS which uses stronger digest algorithms \n\n \n \n (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384)
    and another which uses the Advanced \nEncryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter
    Mode (GCM).\n\t </p>\n      "
