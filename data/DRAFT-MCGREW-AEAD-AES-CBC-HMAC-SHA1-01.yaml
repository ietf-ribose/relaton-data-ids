abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption
    with\nadditional authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the\ncomposition
    of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher\nBlock Chaining (CBC)
    mode of operation for encryption, and the HMAC-\nSHA1 message authentication code
    (MAC).  It also separately defines a\ngeneric composition method that can be used
    with other MACs and\nrandomized ciphers (that is, ciphers that use random initialization\nvectors).\n\nThese
    algorithms are randomized, and thus are suitable for use with\napplications that
    cannot provide distinct nonces to each invocation\nof the AEAD encrypt operation.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
