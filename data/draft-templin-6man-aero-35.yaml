abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO)
    service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces.
    AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol. Prefix delegation/registration services
    are employed for network admission and to manage the IP forwarding and routing
    systems. Secure multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, traffic path
    selection and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor
    cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service especially
    well-suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile end
    user devices and many other applications.</p>"
