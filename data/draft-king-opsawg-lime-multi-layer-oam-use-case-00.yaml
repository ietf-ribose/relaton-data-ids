- content: "<p>As operators deploy and operate multi-layer networks and diverse transport
    technologies, layer independent Operations, Maintenance &amp; Administration Management
    (OAM) would be beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting operations of network
    and service infrastructure. This document identifies and discusses the key use-cases
    and high- level requirements for layer independent Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance management to facilitate operations and maintenance in multi-layer
    and multi-domain networks utilizing a wide variety of heterogeneous networking
    technologies.</p>"
