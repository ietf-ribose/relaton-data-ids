abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure and Scalable Location Routing Protocol (SSLRP) is a secure
    and distributed routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks of mobile nodes
    with location information. Commonly, each node acquires its own geographic position
    using a mechanism such as the Global Position System (GPS). The SSLRP addresses
    each node using the hybrid of its multi-level hierarchical address and unique
    identifier at the moment of network initialization. Certain measures were adopted
    to ensure security of the network.</p>"
