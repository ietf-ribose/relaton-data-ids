abstract:
- content: "<p>The PASSporT format defines a token that can be carried by signaling
    protocols, including SIP, to cryptographically attest the identify of callers.
    Not all telephone calls use Internet signaling protocols, however, and some calls
    use them for only part of their signaling path, or cannot reliably deliver SIP
    header fields end-to-end. This document describes use cases that require the delivery
    of PASSporT objects outside of the signaling path, and defines architectures and
    semantics to provide this functionality.</p>"
