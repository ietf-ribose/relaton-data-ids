abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Client puzzles allow a TLS server to defend itself against
    asymmetric\n   DDoS attacks.  In particular, it allows a server to request clients\n
    \  perform a selected amount of computation prior to the server\n   performing
    expensive cryptographic operations.  This allows servers\n   to employ a layered
    defense that represents an improvement over pure\n   rate-limiting strategies.\n\n
    \  Client puzzles are implemented as an extension to TLS 1.3\n   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
    wherein a server can issue a HelloRetryRequest\n   containing the puzzle as an
    extension.  The client must then resend\n   its ClientHello with the puzzle results
    in the extension.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
