abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol (BWTP) is an application-\nlevel
    protocol that can be used to upgrade a HTTP/1.1 connection, as\ndefined by [RFC2616]
    to a bidirectional channel capable of exchanging\nmessages.  It is intended that
    BWTP can be used as a transport\nprotocol for the HTML 5 Websocket API, as well
    as for other uses.\n\t </p>\n      "
