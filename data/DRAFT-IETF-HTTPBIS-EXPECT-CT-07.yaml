abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new HTTP header field, named Expect-CT,
    that\n   allows web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid\n   Signed
    Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to\n   these hosts.
    \ Expect-CT allows web host operators to discover\n   misconfigurations in their
    Certificate Transparency deployments and\n   ensure that misissued certificates
    accepted by UAs are discoverable\n   in Certificate Transparency logs.\n\n\t </p>\n
