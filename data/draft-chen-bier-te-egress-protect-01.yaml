abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for fast protection against the
    failure of an egress node of an explicit point to multipoint (P2MP) multicast
    path/tree in a "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER) Traffic Engineering (TE)
    domain. It does not have any per-flow state in the core of the domain. For a multicast
    packet to the egress node, when the egress node fails, its upstream hop as a PLR
    sends the packet to the egress' backup node once the PLR detects the failure.</p>
