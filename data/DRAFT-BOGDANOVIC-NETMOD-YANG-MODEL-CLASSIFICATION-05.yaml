abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being\n
    \  considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the\n   networking
    industry at large.  Many standards defining organizations,\n   open source projects,
    and vendors are using YANG to develop and\n   publish models of configuration,
    state data and operations for a wide\n   variety of applications.  At the same
    time, there is currently no\n   well-known terminology to categorize various types
    of YANG models.\n\n   A consistent terminology would help with the categorization
    of\n   models, assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling efforts in the\n
    \  IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-related\n   discussions
    between the different groups.\n\n   This document describes a set of concepts
    and associated terms to\n   support consistent classification of YANG models.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
