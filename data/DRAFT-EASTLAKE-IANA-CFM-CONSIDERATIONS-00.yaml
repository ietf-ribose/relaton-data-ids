abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IEEE 802.1 has specified Continuity Fault Management (CFM)
    OAM\n   facilities. CFM messages are structured with an Op-Code field and\n   have
    provision for the inclusion of TLV (type, length, value)\n   structured information.
    IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM Op-\n   Codes and TLV Types to the IETF.
    This document specifies the IANA\n   Consideration for the assignment of values
    from these blocks.\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT                    IANA Considerations for
    CFM Codepoints\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
