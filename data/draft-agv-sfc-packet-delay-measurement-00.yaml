abstract:
- content: "<p>Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the capability
    to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet Delay. The common reasons
    for packet delay are Nodal processing(Algorithmic, Packetization etc...), Queuing,
    Transmission delay, Propagation delay and Service Function processing delay. Packet
    Delay Measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility into
    the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,
    troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation. This document specifies best
    possible efficient and accurate mechanism for passive packet delay measurement
    for Service Function Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.</p>"
