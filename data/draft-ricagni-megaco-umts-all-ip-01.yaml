abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This contribution contains a study aimed at investigating thepossible
    protocols for multimedia call management in 3GPPAll-IP networks, and at providing
    the shared technical backgroundrequired to chose the most appropriate one. In
    this first version,call flows are described for multimedia calls using H.248 as
    thecall control protocol and for a basic call (voice call) over UMTS IPnetwork.
    Further versions of this document will investigate other protocols among those
    selected by 3GPP (H.248, H.323, SIP), and the advantages and drawbacks of each
    approach will be highlighted. The network reference model is the same one proposed
    by 3GPP for an all-IP UMTS Core Network. [2]</p>"
