abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism
    where\n   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to\n   indicate
    congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will\n   feedback this
    information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in\n   such a way that only
    one feedback signal can be transmitted per\n   Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently
    new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or\n   DCTCP need more accurate feedback information
    in the case where more\n   than one marking is received in one RTT.\n\n\t </p>\n
