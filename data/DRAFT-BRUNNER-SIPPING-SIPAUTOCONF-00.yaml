abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The problem of today's VoIP user agents (hardware terminals,
    SIP soft\n   phones) is the need for quite a bit of manual configuration at the\n
    \  initialization time as well as when moving from one environment to\n   another.
    \ The information to be configured is typically not known by\n   the end-user.
    \ Automatic configuration of SIP user agents would\n   release the user of these
    configuration tasks.  This memo describes\n   the challenges of auto-configuration
    of SIP user agents and gives\n   some requirements for further discussions.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
