abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The query/response transactions of the Domain Name System (DNS)
    can\n   disclose valuable meta-data about the online activities of DNS'\n   users.
    \ The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide object-level\n   security, but
    do not attempt to secure the DNS transaction itself.\n   For example, DNSSEC does
    not protect against information leakage, and\n   only protects DNS data until
    the last validating recursive resolver.\n   Stub resolvers are vulnerable to adversaries
    in the network between\n   themselves and their validating resolver (\"the last
    mile\").  This\n   document details a new DANE-like DNS Resource Record (RR) type
    called\n   IPSECA, and explains how to use it to bootstrap DNS transactions\n
    \  through informing entries in IPsec Security Policy Databases (SPDs)\n   and
    to subsequently verifying Security Associations (SAs) for OE\n   IPsec tunnels.\n\n\t
