abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes techniques for allowing sites running
    the\n   Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP [LISP]) to interoperate with\n   Internet
    sites not running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP-\n   speaking sites is
    that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather\n   than traditional IP addresses,
    in the source and destination fields\n   of all traffic they emit or receive.
    \ While EIDs are syntactically\n   identical to IP addresses, routes for them
    are not carried in the\n   global routing system so an interoperability mechanism
    is needed for\n   non-LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking
    sites.\n   This document introduces two such mechanisms: the first uses a new\n
    \  network element, the LISP Proxy Tunnel Router (PTR) (Section 5) to\n   act
    as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP-\n   speaking
    hosts while the second adds Network Address Translation\n   (NAT) functionality
    to LISP Ingress and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers\n   (xTRs) to substitute routable
    IP addresses for non-routable EIDs.\n\t </p>\n      "
