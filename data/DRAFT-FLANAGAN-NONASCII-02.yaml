abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and
    a more\n   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for\n
    \  the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the\n   accepted
    language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be\n   in UTF-8.  This
    document describes the RFC Editor requirements and\n   guidance regarding the
    use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.\n\n   This document updates the RFC Style
    Guide [I-D.iab-styleguide].\n\n   Please review the PDF or HTML versions of this
    draft to see the full\n   text, examples, and references.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
