abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes an experimental protocol for publicly
    logging\n   the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they\n
    \  are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit\n   certificate
    authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of\n   suspect certificates as
    well as to audit the certificate logs\n   themselves.  The intent is that eventually
    clients would refuse to\n   honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively
    forcing\n   CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.\n\n   Logs are network
    services that implement the protocol operations for\n   submissions and queries
    that are defined in this document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
