abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Event service is an asynchronous communication model between\n
    \  interacting parties, e.g. autonomic functions (AFs), instead of a\n   tightly
    coupled point-to-point (P2P) synchronous communication model.\n   Event service
    enables autonomic nodes in ANI to publish data\n   information, which will be
    made network distributable autonomously,\n   and subscribers who register interests
    to specific events will be\n   notified if the information is available. This
    draft describes how to\n   support event service (ES) for autonomic networking.\n\n\t
