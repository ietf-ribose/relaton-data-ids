abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time
    content and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the control channel
    between the sender and receiver. However, RTP and RTCP assume a single delivery
    path between the sender and receiver and make decisions based on the measured
    characteristics of this single path. Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed,
    which means that they are connected via multiple Internet paths. Network utilization
    can be improved when endpoints use multiple parallel paths for communication.
    The resulting increase in reliability and throughput can also enhance the user
    experience. This document extends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that
    a single session can take advantage of the availability of multiple paths between
    two endpoints.</p>"
