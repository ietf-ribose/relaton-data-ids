abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   RFC 6761 requires that proponents document how a specific name
    is to\n   be treated within the DNS protocol, public database, and\n   administrative
    infrastructure, but doesn't provide any guidance to\n   help the community figure
    out whether a particular registration is\n   otherwise beneficial.  This limited
    guidance in RFC 6761 provides\n   flexibility in a difficult area-- the use of
    domain names in the\n   modern Internet outside of conventional DNS protocol or
    the public\n   DNS database-- which has been useful from time to time but has
    also\n   caused significant confusion (see RFC 8244).\n\n   This document attempts
    to define guidelines for the IESG and the IETF\n   community on the interpretation
    of RFC 6761 and the use of the\n   special use names registry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
