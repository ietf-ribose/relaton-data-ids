abstract:
  content: "\t <t>If the Internet is accessed via cellular networks, the Point-to-Pointprotocol
    (PPP) is most commonly used for configuration of thecircuit-switched or packet-switched
    link. Thus, this PPPconfiguration time comes in addition to the usual call-setup
    time forthe cellular connection. In many cases this will result in a fairlylong
    'wait time' as perceived by end users before actual applicationdata can be transmitted.This
    proposal describes a solution in which the PPP configurationtime can be significantly
    reduced (on the order of seconds) in caseswhere both peer protocol entities can
    be modified according to thisproposal, which involves modifying standard PPP.
    In cases where onePPP peer is modified and the other utilizes only standard PPP,
    themodified peer can fallback to standard PPP operation. This fallbackmechanism
    will not noticeably affect the PPP setup time, and servesto ensure interoperability.</p>"
