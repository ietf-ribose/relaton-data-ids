abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network. A
    Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which consists of
    a subset of the network topology and network resources allocated from the physical
    network. A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.
    In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique logicial network
    topology. This document describes a mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using
    IS-IS Multi-Topology together with other well-defined IS-IS extensions.</p>"
