abstract:
  content: "<p>Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methodsother
    than GET to expose information. This has the drawback thatthis kind of information
    is harder to identify (missing a URL towhich a GET request could be applied) and
    to cache.This document specifies a simple extension header through which aserver
    can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP clientsubsequently can use with the
    GET method.</p>"
