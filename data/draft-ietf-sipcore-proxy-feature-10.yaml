abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps. The
    Feature-Caps header field conveys feature capability indicators that are used
    to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP entities that are not
    represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Contact header field.
    SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact header field can
    convey media feature tags in the header field to indicate support of features
    and capabilities. This specification also defines feature capability indicators,
    and creates a new IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature Feature Capability Indicator Trees",
    for registering feature capability indicators.</p>
