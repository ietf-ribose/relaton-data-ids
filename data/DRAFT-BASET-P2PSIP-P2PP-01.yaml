abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), an\napplication-layer
    binary protocol, for creating and maintaining an\noverlay of participant nodes.
    \ The overlay can be created using\nvarious structured and unstructured peer-to-peer
    protocols such as\nBamboo, Chord, Pastry, Kademlia, Gnutella, and Gia. P2PP uses
    a\nsecure transport, supports an application API, has mechanisms for NAT\nand
    firewall traversal, exchanging node capabilities, and diagnostic\ninformation.
    \ P2PP is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation\nProtocol (SIP) network,
    but it can be used for other applications as\nwell.\n\t </p>\n      "
