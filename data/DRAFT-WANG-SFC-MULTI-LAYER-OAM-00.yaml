abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Since there are different notions of service chain, such as
    fully\n   abstract notion named SFC, half-fully abstraction notion named SFP\n
    \  and fully specific notion named RSP, and there are different\n   components
    defined in SFC architecture, it seems reasonable to define\n   differentiated
    OAM for these different service chains.  This document\n   tries to discuss the
    multi-layer OAM requirements in SFC domain and\n   provides a multi-layer OAM
    solution for different service chains.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
