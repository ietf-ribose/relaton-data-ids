abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a new\nset
    of headers, which can significantly reduce the network traffic\nused for sending
    pages containing advertising banners and other\nrelated content. We begin by describing
    the problems generated by the\nuse of 'cache-busting' techniques today and why
    the Hit-metering\nscheme [RFC2227], by itself, may not be adequate. We will then\ndescribe
    a new scheme which relies on collaboration between the\ncontent providers and
    the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
