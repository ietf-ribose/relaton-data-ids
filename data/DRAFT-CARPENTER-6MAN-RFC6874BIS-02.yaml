abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6
    scoped\n   address, defined as &lt;zone_id&gt; in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture\n
    \  (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a\n   Uniform
    Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address.  It\n   updates the
    URI Generic Syntax specification (RFC 3986) accordingly,\n   and obsoletes RFC
    6874.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
