abstract:
  content: <p>When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP thenproblems
    occur with E.164 number ownership. Additionally, there aresecurity challenges
    when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticateand authorize the calling party.
    Without addressing these twoaspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent.
    Thisdocument aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, notinvestigate
    current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIPIdentity"). Such an analysis
    is provided by other documents already.</p>
