abstract:
- content: <p>When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then problems
    occur with E.164 number ownership. Additionally, there are security challenges
    when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate and authorize the calling party.
    Without addressing these two aspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent.
    This document aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, not investigate
    current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIP Identity"). Such an analysis
    is provided by other documents already.</p>
