abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. This document adds new SDP media-level
    attributes so that when establishing interactive communication sessions ("calls"),
    it is possible to negotiate (communicate and match) the caller's language and
    media needs with the capabilities of the called party. This is especially important
    with emergency calls, where a call can be handled by a call taker capable of communicating
    with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call
    during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an example,
    when calling a company call center). This document describes the need and a solution
    using new SDP media attributes.</p>
