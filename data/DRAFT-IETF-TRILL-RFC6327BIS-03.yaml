abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches\n   including
    point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area\n   Network) links that
    can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations\n   attached. TRILL uses IS-IS
    (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n   System) routing. This document specifies
    the establishment,\n   reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacencies between
    TRILL\n   switches, also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-\n
    \  local aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU\n   (Maximum
    Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD\n   (Bi-Directional Forwarding
    Detection) session bootstrapping in\n   connection with adjacency. State diagrams
    are included where\n   appropriate.  This document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates
    RFC 6325.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
