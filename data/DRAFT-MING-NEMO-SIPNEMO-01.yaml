abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol enables
    a mobile\n   network to change its point of attachment and keeps nodes in the\n
    \  mobile network reachable when the mobile network moves in the\n   Internet.
    \ However, using the NEMO Basic Support protocol, all\n   traffic must pass through
    the bi-directional tunnel between a mobile\n   router and its home agent when
    the mobile router leaves its home\n   network.  The bi-directional tunnel results
    in sub-optimal routing\n   and long transmission delay.  This document describes
    the SIP-based\n   Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) Route Optimization (RO) that achieves\n
    \  optimal routing and reduces the limitation induced by Mobile IPv6.\n\n\n\t
