abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both
    address\n   families and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of
    the\n   single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of the transition to\n
    \  IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP\n   address
    family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will\n   provide transit
    services to attached client networks running another\n   IP address family (referred
    to as external IP or E-IP).  It is\n   expected that the I-IP backbone will offer
    unicast and multicast\n   transit services to the client E-IP networks.\n\n   Softwires
    Mesh is a solution to E-IP unicast and multicast support\n   across an I-IP backbone.
    \ This document describes the mechanisms for\n   supporting Internet-style multicast
    across a set of E-IP and I-IP\n   networks supporting softwires mesh.\n\n\n\t
