abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes a protocol and new DNS Resource Record
    that\n   can be used to provide a cryptographic message digest over DNS zone\n
    \  data.  The ZONEMD Resource Record conveys the digest data in the zone\n   itself.
    \ When a zone publisher includes an ZONEMD record, recipients\n   can verify the
    zone contents for accuracy and completeness.  This\n   provides assurance that
    received zone data matches published data,\n   regardless of how the zone data
    has been transmitted and received.\n\n   ZONEMD is not designed to replace DNSSEC.
    \ Whereas DNSSEC protects\n   individual RRSets (DNS data with fine granularity),
    ZONEMD protects a\n   zone's data as a whole, whether consumed by authoritative
    name\n   servers, recursive name servers, or any other applications.\n\n   As
    specified at this time, ZONEMD is not designed for use in large,\n   dynamic zones
    due to the time and resources required for digest\n   calculation.  The ZONEMD
    record described in this document is\n   designed so that new digest schemes may
    be developed in the future to\n   support large, dynamic zones.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
