abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin
    server to\n   describe the secondary cache key ([RFC7234], section 4.1) for a\n
    \  resource, by conveying what is effectively a short algorithm that can\n   be
    used upon later requests to determine if a stored response is\n   reusable for
    a given request.\n\n   Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip
    for\n   validation whenever a new request differs slightly, but not\n   significantly,
    from prior requests.\n\n   Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics
    that\n   might result in different content, which can be useful if the user\n
    \  agent is not sending request header fields in order to reduce the\n   risk
    of fingerprinting.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
