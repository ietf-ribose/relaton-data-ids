abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes extensions to existing CR-LDP for setting
    up \nMPLS backup tunnels. These tunnels can protect Label Switched Paths  \non
    an exclusive bandwidth basis or shared bandwidth on the back up \npaths, as desired
    by the initiator of the tunnel at the head end \nnode. Several backup segments
    are maintained for a single LSP and \nthey are meant to provide link and node
    failure protection along \nvarious segments of the LSP. Sharing of backup segments
    across \nmultiple LSPs is also facilitated to achieve scalability \n  \n\t </p>\n
