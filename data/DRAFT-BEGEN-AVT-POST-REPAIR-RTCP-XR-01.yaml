abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new report block type within the framework
    of\nRTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR).  One of the\ninitial XR
    report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE)\nReport Block.  This
    report conveys the information regarding the\nindividual Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP) packet receipt and loss\nevents experienced during the RTCP interval preceding
    the\ntransmission of the report.  The new report, which is referred to as\nthe
    Post-repair Loss RLE Report, carries the information regarding\nthe remaining
    lost packets after all error-repair techniques are\napplied.  By comparing the
    RTP packet receipts/losses before and\nafter the error repair is completed, one
    can determine the\neffectiveness of the error-repair techniques in an aggregated\nfashion.
    \ This document also defines the signaling of the Post-repair\nLoss RLE Report
    in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).\n\t </p>\n      "
