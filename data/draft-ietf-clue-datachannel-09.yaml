abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines how to use the WebRTC data channel mechanism in
    order to realize a data channel, referred to as a CLUE data channel, for transporting
    CLUE protocol messages between two CLUE entities. The document defines how to
    describe the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize the CLUE data channel using
    the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and defines usage of SDP-based "SCTP over
    DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism for establishing a CLUE data channel.
    Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP Offer/Answer
    procedures for negotiating usage of a CLUE data channel, are outside the scope
    of this document.</p>
