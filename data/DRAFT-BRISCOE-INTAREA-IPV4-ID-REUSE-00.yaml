abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that
    is both\nprincipled and a hack.  It builds on recent moves to formalise the\nincreasingly
    common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely\nmatches that of IPv6.
    \ The large majority of IPv4 packets are now\n'atomic', meaning indivisible.  In
    such packets, the 16 bits of the\nIPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant
    and could be freed\nup for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least
    within\nthe constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly.  This\nspecification
    defines the process for redefining the semantics of\nthese bits.  It uses the
    previously reserved control flag in the IPv4\nheader to indicate that these 16
    bits have new semantics.  Great care\nis taken throughout to ease incremental
    deployment, even in the\npresence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise
    packets\nthat have the reserved control flag set.\n\t </p>\n      "
