abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) messages will be carried
    as\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) documents.  As such, the goal of\nmapping
    to the transport layer is to ensure that the underlying XML\ndocuments are carried
    successfully between the various parties.  This\ndocument describes that mapping
    for the Hyper Text Transport Protocol\n(HTTP), Versions 1.0 and 1.1, and the location
    of HTTP based IOTP\nservices using the SRV domain name system resource record.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
