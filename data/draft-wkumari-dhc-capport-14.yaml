abstract:
- content: "<p>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.
    This document describes a DHCP option (and a RA extension) to inform clients that
    they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to
    authenticate to get Internet Access. It is not a full solution to address all
    of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be
    used in larger solutions. The method of authenticating to, and interacting with
    the captive portal is out of scope of this document. [ Ed note (remove): This
    document is being developed in github: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dhc-capport
    . ]</p>"
