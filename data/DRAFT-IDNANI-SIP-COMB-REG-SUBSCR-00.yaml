abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo proposes that the headers of REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE
    be    \ncombined, so that a REGISTER message can also be treated as an    \nimplicit
    subscription for events. This memo identifies the need for    \ndoing this, and
    then explains how combining the Registration and \nSubscription solves the problem.
    It also presents an example flow    \ndemonstrating the use of this combined registration
    and subscription.   \nThe headers being combined will be made optional in the
    REGISTER and   \nSUBSCRIBE messages - depending on where they do not appear as
    of    \ntoday - so that backward compatibility is maintained.\n\t </p>\n      "
