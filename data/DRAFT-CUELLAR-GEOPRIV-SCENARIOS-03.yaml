abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes location-based service scenarios for Geopriv.\nIt
    complements the Geopriv Requirements document by providing a set\nof examples
    in which the Geopriv Location Object (LO) may be used.\nThus this documents serves
    as a basis to discuss and analyze the\nsecurity (authentication, authorization,
    integrity and\nconfidentiality) and privacy issues and requirements associated
    with\nlocation-based services.  To be useful, these scenarios include\ndetails
    of location computation, which helps to identify the entities\ninvolved on an
    abstract level and where privacy issues like control,\nconsent, access, and security
    arise.\n\t </p>\n      "
