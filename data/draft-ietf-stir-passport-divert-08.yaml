abstract:
  content: "<p>PASSporT is specified in RFC 8225 to convey cryptographically-signed
    information about the people involved in personal communications. This document
    extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its
    original destination to a new one. This information can greatly improve the decisions
    made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios. Also specified here
    is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that
    assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.</p>"
