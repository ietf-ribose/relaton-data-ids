abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document proposes FAST TCP, a modification to the TCP congestion\ncontrol
    algorithm for high-speed long-distance networks. The \nAIMD congestion control
    algorithm in the current TCP has \nequilibrium and dynamic problems that become
    more and more severe \nas bandwidth-delay product increases.  FAST TCP uses feedback\ninformation,
    in addition to packet loss, to address these problems in \norder to stabilize
    a network around a fair and efficient\noperating point.\n   .\n\t </p>\n      "
