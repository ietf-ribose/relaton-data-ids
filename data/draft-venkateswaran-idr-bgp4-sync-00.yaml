abstract:
  content: "\t <t>BGP (Border gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol, which sharesthe
    information of its routing table on incremental basis.BGP needs to interact with
    the IGP peers within the autonomoussystem when all the routers inside the autonomous
    system do not runBGP. This document provides a detailed implementation ofsynchronization
    in BGP.This document specifies some implementation specifics ofsynchronization
    and also throws some of the pros and cons involvedin implementing synchronization.
    This also reveals the points to betaken care when transition happens from synchronization
    to Nosynchronization and vice versa. Some of the precautions that are tobe taken
    before implementing synchronization in BGP are alsohighlighted here.</p>"
