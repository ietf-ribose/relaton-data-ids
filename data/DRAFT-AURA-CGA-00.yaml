abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses
    \nwhere the interface identifier is generated by hashing the address \nowner's
    public key. The address owner can then use the \ncorresponding private key to
    assert address ownership and to sign \nmessages sent from the address without
    any additional security \ninfrastructure. This document describes a generic CGA
    format that \ncan be used in multiple applications.  \n\t </p>\n      "
