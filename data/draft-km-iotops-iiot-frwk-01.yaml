abstract:
- content: "<p>Industrial networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks
    and have been slow to adopt virtualization technologies. Virtualization is necessary
    to remove the boundaries between the enterprise and process control networks.
    Virtualization of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) can improve the automation
    in Industry control networks by simplifying communication between higher-level
    applications and low-level factory floor machine operations. It provides an opportunity
    to integrate a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT
    and IP connections. This document describes the details and benefits of virtualized
    PLCs and focuses on the problem statement and requirements.</p>"
