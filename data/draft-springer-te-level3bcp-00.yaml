abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-ProtocolLabel
    Switching in the Level3 network. A brief overview of trafficengineering is given
    followed by constraints affecting Level3'sdesign. The approach Level3 will use,
    which is LDP edge and an RSVP-TEcore, is presented. Several architectures were
    considered whendeciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as
    thereasons they were ultimately refuted.</p>"
