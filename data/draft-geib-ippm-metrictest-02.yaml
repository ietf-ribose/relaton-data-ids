abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independentinstantiations
    of a performance metric RFC have implemented thespecifications in the same way.
    This is the performance metricequivalent of interoperability, required to advance
    RFCs along thestandards track. Results from different implementations of metricRFCs
    will be collected under the same underlying network conditionsand compared using
    state of the art statistical methods. The goal isan evaluation of the metric RFC
    itself, whether its definitions areclear and unambiguous to implementors and therefore
    a candidate foradvancement on the IETF standards track.</p>"
