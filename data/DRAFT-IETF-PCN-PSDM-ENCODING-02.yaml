abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load-\n
    \  dependent packet re-marking mechanism and provides in Differentiated\n   Services
    networks feedback to egress nodes about load conditions\n   within the domain.
    \ It is used to support admission control and flow\n   termination decision in
    a simple way.  This document proposes how PCN\n   marks can be encoded into the
    IP header for packet-specific dual\n   marking (PSDM).  PSDM encoding provides
    three different codepoints:\n   not-ETM, not-ThM, and PM.  Excess-traffic-marking
    may re-mark not-\n   ETM-packets to PM and threshold-marking may re-mark not-ThM-packets\n
    \  to PM.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
