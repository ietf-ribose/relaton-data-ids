abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to serve as input to the design of the
    Source Address Validation architecture being defined in the SAVI WG. In particular,
    it analyses the different ways to handle data packets for which no binding exists,
    and the impact of the different approaches in the overall performance of the network.</p>"
