abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key
    Exchange\n   version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for\n
    \  performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining\n   Security
    Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several optional\n   features, which are not
    needed in minimal implementations.  This\n   document describes what is required
    from the minimal implementation,\n   and also describes various optimizations
    which can be done.  The\n   protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2
    with exception\n   that this document describes mainly shared secret authentication\n
    \  (IKEv2 requires support for certificate authentication in addition to\n   shared
    secret authentication).\n\n   This document does not update or modify RFC 5996,
    but provides more\n   compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.
    \ If this\n   document and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the authoritative\n
    \  description.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
