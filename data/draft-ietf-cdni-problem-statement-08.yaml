abstract:
- content: "<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits for cacheable
    content: reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience for End Users,
    and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons, they are frequently used
    for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN Providers are scaling
    up their infrastructure, and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying
    their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered
    to an End User regardless of that End User's location or attachment network. This
    is the motivation for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate
    as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content
    from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users. However, no standards or open
    specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN Interconnection. The goal
    of this document is to outline the problem area of CDN Interconnection for the
    IETF CDNI (CDN Interconnection) working group. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
