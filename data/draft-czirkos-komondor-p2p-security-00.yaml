abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents Komondor, an experimental peer-to-peer security
    system. Komondor is a network intrusion detection system. Hosts running this software
    organize themselves automatically in an overlay network, where they share information
    about intrusion attempts they detect. This way the security of all participants
    is increased, as they are able to prepare for some of the attacks in advance.
    The overlay created is a peer-to-peer network, which is completely decentralized.
    This communication model ensures stability, and by using this the system remains
    operational over an unstable network.</p>"
