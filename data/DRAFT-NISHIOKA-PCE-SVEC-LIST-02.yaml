abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path \n
    \   computations, for instance calculating a diverse working and \n    protected
    path do not share common network points, would need to \n    synchronize the computations
    in order to increase the probability \n    of meeting the working and protected
    path disjoint objective and \n    network resource optimization objective. When
    a PCE computes \n    multiple sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently,
    \n    it is required to use Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list for \n    association
    among the sets of dependent path computation requests. \n    This document describes
    the usage of multiple SVECs in the SVEC \n    list and its processing guideline,
    for the synchronized computation \n    of dependent paths. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
