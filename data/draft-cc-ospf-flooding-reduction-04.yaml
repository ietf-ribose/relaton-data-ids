abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an approach to flood link states on a topology
    that is a subgraph of the complete topology per underline physical network, so
    that the amount of flooding traffic in the network is greatly reduced, and it
    would reduce convergence time with a more stable and optimized routing environment.
    The approach can be applied to any network topology in a single area.</p>"
