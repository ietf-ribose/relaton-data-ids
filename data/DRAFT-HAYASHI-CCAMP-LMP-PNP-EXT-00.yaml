abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane
    \n   (c-plane) is expected to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX). \n   Currently
    we need to, however, manually configure interface \n   addresses of links before
    we advertise the link-state using a \n   GMPLS routing protocol for an automatic
    topology discovery \n   mechanism. Especially in Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (WDM) \n   networks, there are a number of optical fibers between neighbor \n
    \  nodes, each of which again carries a bunch of wavelength links. It \n   is
    a tedious task to configure interface addresses of wavelength \n   links between
    neighbor nodes.\n\n   In order to suppress the tasks of configuring addresses
    of \n   wavelength links between neighbor nodes, an optical plug and play \n   (PnP)
    technique is effective. Optical PnP includes automatic \n   assignment of interface
    addresses, parameter information exchange \n   between neighbor nodes, database
    construction, and so on.\n\n   This document assumes to use extended version of
    LMP (link \n   management protocol) for information exchange and describes LMP
    \n   extension necessary for applying to the optical PnP.\n\t </p>\n      "
