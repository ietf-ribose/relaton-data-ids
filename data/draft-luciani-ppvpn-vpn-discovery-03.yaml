abstract:
  content: "\t <t>Virtual private networks are becoming a common offering of manyservice
    providers. There are many technologies with which toimplement a VPN service, ranging
    from MPLS to GRE to IPSEC. Acommon requirement of all VPN technologies is the
    need to discoverall of the sites, or at least all the provider equipment associatedwith
    the sites, that are in a particular VPN. DNS provides asimple and commonly available
    mechanism for site discovery that isindependent of any signaling or tunneling
    protocol. This draftproposes the use of DNS as a discovery mechanism for VPN maintenanceand
    control.</p>"
