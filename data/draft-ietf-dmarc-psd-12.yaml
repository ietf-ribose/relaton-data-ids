abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
    permits a domain-controlling organization to express domain- level policies and
    preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, which a mail-receiving
    organization can use to improve mail handling. DMARC distinguishes the portion
    of a name that is a Public Suffix Domain (PSD), below which organizational domain
    names are created. The basic DMARC capability allows organizational domains to
    specify policies that apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that capability
    to PSDs. This document describes an extension to DMARC to fully enable DMARC functionality
    for PSDs. Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for DMARC
    enforcement. This specification addresses that case.</p>"
