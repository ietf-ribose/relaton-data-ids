abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   As an important technical means to detect network state, network\n
    \  measurement has attracted more and more attention in the development\n   of
    network.  However, the current network measurement technology has\n   the problem
    that the measurement method and the measurement purpose\n   cannot match well.
    \ To solve this problem, this memo introduces\n   network measurement intent,
    namely the process of realizing user or\n   network operator to allocate network
    states as needed.  And it can be\n   as a specified user case of intent based
    network.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
