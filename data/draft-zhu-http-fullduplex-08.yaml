abstract:
- content: "<p>Full-duplex HTTP follows the basic HTTP request-response semantics
    but also allows the server to send response body to the client at the same time
    when the client is transmitting request body to the server. Requirements for full-duplex
    HTTP are under-specified in the existing HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol --
    HTTP/1.1) specification, and this memo intends to clarify the requirements of
    full-duplex HTTP on top of the basic HTTP protocol semantics.</p>"
