abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document is intended for clarification of LDP behaviour
    of link-\n   down scenarios.  Base LDP RFC5036 lacks sufficient clarity on what
    an\n   LDP enabled node should be doing when a link down event is received,\n
    \  and the only LDP adjacency for an LDP peer is over this link.\n   Different
    vendors have handled this scenario differently, with some\n   immediately resetting
    tcp session with neighbour and some waiting for\n   igp recovergence instead of
    reacting directly to link events.  With\n   this document we intend to clarify
    the expected behaviour explicitly\n   so that any interop issues can be avoided.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
