abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative
    effects on MPLS traffic caused by LSR's control plane restart, and specifically
    by the restart of its RSVP-TE component, on LSRs that are capable of preserving
    the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.</p>"
