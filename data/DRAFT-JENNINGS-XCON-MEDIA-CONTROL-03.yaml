abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Conference servers have many controls that change how the media
    is\n   combined for the various conference participants.  It is necessary to\n
    \  describe these controls to the clients connected to a centralized\n   conference,
    so that the clients can render a user interface and allow\n   the user to manipulate
    them.\n\n   This work is being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.  This\n
    \  draft has not changed since the 02 version.\n\t </p>\n      "
