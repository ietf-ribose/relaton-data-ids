abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies enhancements to the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP) that mitigate security issues in particular use\n   cases.
    \ The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness\n   of a request
    or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its\n   claimed network address.
    \ The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP\n   server to match block-wise message
    fragments belonging to the same\n   request.  This document updates RFC 7252 with
    respect to the client\n   Token processing requirements, forbidding non-secure
    reuse of Tokens\n   to ensure binding of response to request when CoAP is used
    with a\n   security protocol, and with respect to amplification mitigation,\n
    \  where the use of Echo is now recommended.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
