abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency\n
    \  transport of content over the World Wide Web. SPDY introduces two\n   layers
    of protocol.  The lower layer is a general purpose framing\n   layer which can
    be used atop a reliable transport (likely TCP) for\n   multiplexed, prioritized,
    and compressed data communication of many\n   concurrent streams.  The upper layer
    of the protocol provides HTTP-\n   like RFC2616 [RFC2616] semantics for compatibility
    with existing HTTP\n   application servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
