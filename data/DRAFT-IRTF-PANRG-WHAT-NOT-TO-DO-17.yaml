abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research
    Group, the\n   research group agreed to catalog and analyze past efforts to develop\n
    \  and deploy Path Aware techniques, most of which were unsuccessful or\n   at
    most partially successful, in order to extract insights and\n   lessons for path-aware
    networking researchers.\n\n   This document contains that catalog and analysis.\n\n\t
