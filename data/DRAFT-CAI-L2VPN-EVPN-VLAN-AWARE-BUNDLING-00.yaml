abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies E-VPN extensions to support the new
    VLAN\n   aware bundling service interface type defined in [EVPN-REQ]. The new\n
    \  service interface type provides advantages in reducing provisioning\n   overhead
    as well as E-VPN instances scale in environments where a\n   large number of VLANs
    need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network,\n   while maintaining traffic segregation
    among those VLANs. The VLAN\n   aware bundling service interface can handle the
    high scale\n   requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs
    over\n   a single WAN E-VPN instance used to interconnect those Data Center\n
    \  sites.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
