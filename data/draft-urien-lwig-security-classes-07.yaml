abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to define security classes for constraint IoT devices.
    A device security is characterized by five Boolean security attributes: one time
    programmable memory (OTP), firmware loader (FLD), secure firmware loader (FLD-SEC),
    tamper resistant key (TRT- KEY) and diversified key (DIV-KEY). This leads to the
    definition of 6 classes of devices, embedding or not OTP resource, whose security
    increases with the class number (0 to 5). The suffix + indicates OTP availability.</p>"
