abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Some service providers build and operate data centers that
    support\n   over 100,000 servers.  In this document, such data-centers are\n   referred
    to as \"large-scale\" data centers to differentiate them the\n   from more common
    smaller infrastructures.  The data centers of this\n   scale have a unique set
    of network requirements, with emphasis on\n   operational simplicity and network
    stability.\n\n   This document attempts to summarize the authors' experiences
    in\n   designing and supporting large data centers, using BGP as the only\n   control-plane
    protocol.  The intent here is to describe a proven and\n   stable routing design
    that could be leveraged by others in the\n   industry.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
