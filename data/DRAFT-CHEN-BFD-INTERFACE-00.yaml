abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document describes how application clients can request
    IP-based\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) sessions while either being\n
    \  IP agnostic themselves or while dealing with IP unnumbered\n   interfaces.\n\n
    \  A dedicated well-known multicast IP address 224.XXX.XXX.XXX is used\n   as
    the destination IP address of the BFD packets when running BFD for\n   interface.
    \ It allows for BFD sessions on interfaces that may have no\n   IP addresses,
    either because the interface is unnumbered or because\n   the layer 3 protocol
    status of the interfaces is not up yet.\n\n   One application of BFD for interface
    is to run BFD over LAG/Bundle\n   component links.  An example will be given in
    this document.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
