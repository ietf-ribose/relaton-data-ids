abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This note was motivated by the ongoing discussion in the\n
    \  Differentiated Services Working Group regarding the definition of\n   the Assured
    Forwarding (AF) Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) Group. We\n   consider two issues with
    the current proposal for AF PHB Group in\n   [Heinanen]: the recommendation for
    AF discard mechanism, and the\n   definition of AF classes.  We discuss the implications
    of the\n   definitions and recommendations that have raised comments and\n   propose
    alternative texts.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
