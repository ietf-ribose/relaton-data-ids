abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   A link or node failure can
    significantly impact network services in\n   large-scale networks.  Therefore
    it is important to ensure the\n   survivability of large scale networks which
    consist of various\n   connections provided over multiple interconnected networks
    with\n   varying technologies.\n\n   This document examines the applicability
    of the PCE architecture,\n   protocols, and procedures for computing protection
    paths and\n   restoration services, for single and multi-domain networks.\n\n
    \  This document also explains the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR)\n   where
    a point of local repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate\n   merge point (MP)
    to do bypass path computation using PCE.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
