abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo discusses and defines a framework for cyberspace
    resource\n   property description, which is suitable for the unified\n   classification
    organization and description of multi-source network\n   resource measurement
    information.  Now, there is no unified\n   description framework for network resource
    property.  The objective\n   of this draft is to establish a general model based
    on cyberspace\n   identification reference, and implement the reuse of survey
    data in\n   different users and occasions.  Then discuss the basic methodology\n
    \  and propose a less mature framework for further complement and\n   improvement\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
