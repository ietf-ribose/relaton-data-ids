abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is the output from the PIDF team working on the definition
    of the Presence Information Data Format for conveying PRESENCE INFORMATION between
    PRESENTITIES, PRESENCE SERVICE and WATCHERS on top of the PRESENCE INFORMATION
    TRANSPORT PROTOCOL of the IMPP set of protocols. It describes the current status
    of discussion on the IMPP mailing list in relation to the scope of PIDF as well
    as its concrete format. The discussion is on-going at present and future versions
    of this Internet-Draft will further specify the concrete format of PIDF in conformance
    with the IMPP Requirements RFC.</p>"
