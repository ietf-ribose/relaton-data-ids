abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the pervasive\n
    \  interaction of smart devices and people enabling new applications by\n   means
    of IP protocols. Traditional IP protocols will be further\n   complemented by
    6LoWPAN and CoAP to make the IoT feasible on small\n   devices. Security and privacy
    are a must for such an environment. Due\n   to mobility, limited bandwidth, resource
    constraints, and new\n   communication topologies, existing security solutions
    need to be\n   adapted. We propose a security architecture for the IoT in order
    to\n   provide network access control to smart devices, the management of\n   keys
    and securing unicast/multicast communication. Devices are\n   authenticated and
    granted network access by means of a pre-shared key\n   (PSK) based security handshake
    protocol. The solution is based on\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).
    Through the established\n   secure channels, keying materials, operational and
    security\n   parameters are distributed, enabling devices to derive session keys\n
    \  and group keys. The solution relies on the DTLS Record Layer for the\n   protection
    of unicast and multicast data flows. We have prototyped\n   and evaluated the
    security architecture. The DTLS architecture allows\n   for easier interaction
    and interoperability with the Internet due to\n   the extensive use of TLS. However,
    it exhibits performance issues\n   constraining its deployment in some network
    topologies and hence\n   would require further optimizations.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
