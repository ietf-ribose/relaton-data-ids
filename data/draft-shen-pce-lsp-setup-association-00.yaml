abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a hierarchical model for stateful PCE- initiated
    LSPs, based on the PCE association group mechanism. It defines two new association
    types, and introduces a generic mechanism for stateful PCE to use P2P LSPs as
    component LSPs (i.e. sub-LSPs) to construct and set up TE LSPs with complex path
    topology, including P2MP, MP2P, and MP2MP TE LSPs.</p>"
