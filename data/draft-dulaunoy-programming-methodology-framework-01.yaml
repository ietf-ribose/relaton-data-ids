abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also
    known under the PMF methodology. The methodology is based on the manifesto written
    by Zed A. Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which describes a natural approach to
    software engineering with a strong focus on the act of programming. The PMF methodology
    uses a soft naming to allow for a non-partisan reference to official engineering
    or project documents describing one of the most used software engineering methodologies.</p>"
