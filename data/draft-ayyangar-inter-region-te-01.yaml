abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft proposes mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance
    ofMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) that traversemultiple
    regions, where a region could be an IGP Area or an AutonomousSystem or a GMPLS
    overlay network. This document also outlines differentmechanisms that an operator
    could employ within his region to facilitatethe setup of these inter-region TE
    LSPs.</p>"
