abstract:
- content: <p>The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO), and different applications may use different types of cost metrics. Since
    the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a single cost metric (namely, the
    generic "routingcost" metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or
    an endpoint cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
    better performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base protocol
    does not define the cost metric to be used. This document addresses this issue
    by extending the specification to provide a variety of network performance metrics,
    including network delay, delay variation (a.k.a, jitter), packet loss rate, hop
    count, and bandwidth. There are multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements
    or service-level agreement) to derive a performance metric. This document introduces
    an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey the
    source of a performance metric.</p>
