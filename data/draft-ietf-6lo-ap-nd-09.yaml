abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery
    (ND) defined in RFC6775 and updated in [I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update]. The new
    extension is called Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP- ND) and it protects
    the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a low-power
    and lossy network (LLN). Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic
    identifier (Crypto- ID) and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.
    The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to
    provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered
    with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is provided, only the owner of that
    address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address
    Validation.</p>"
