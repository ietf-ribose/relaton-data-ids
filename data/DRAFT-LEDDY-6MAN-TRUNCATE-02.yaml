abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines procedures that enhance Path MTU Discovery\n
    \  (PMTUD), so that it no longer relies on the network's ability to\n   deliver
    an ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) message from a downstream router\n   to an IPv6 source
    node.  According to these procedures, selected\n   packets carry a new IPv6 Destination
    option.  When a downstream\n   router cannot forward one of these packets because
    of MTU issues, it\n   truncates the packet, marks it to indicate that it has been\n
    \  truncated, and forwards it towards the destination node.\n\n   When the destination
    node receives a packet that has been truncated,\n   it sends an ICMP PTB message
    to the source node.  The source node\n   uses MTU information contained by the
    ICMP PTB message to update its\n   PMTU estimate.\n\n   The destination node also
    examines the new Destination option to\n   determine whether it should discard
    the truncated packet or deliver\n   it to an upper-layer protocol.\n\n\t </p>\n
