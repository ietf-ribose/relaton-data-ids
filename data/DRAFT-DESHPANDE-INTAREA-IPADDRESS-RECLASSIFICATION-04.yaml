abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft proposes IP address reclassification. By understanding\n
    \  how the Network is evolving from wireless technologies and comparing\n   with
    an abstract mathematical topological space model, changes such\n   as addition
    of a Virtual address space and Virtual BGP neighborship\n   are proposed.\n   The
    limitations of current Internet Architecture are identified and\n   the corrections
    needed for the traffic bottleneck present in the\n   current Internet Architecture
    are described further.\n   The interdependence of IPv6 ULA addressing scheme,
    multipath and\n   multipath TCP with the virtual neighborship and the virtual
    address\n   space are explored.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
