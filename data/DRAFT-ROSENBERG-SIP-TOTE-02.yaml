abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a simple protocol - Trivial Object Transfer
    and\nExchange (TOTE) - that provides bidirectional exchange of MIME\nobjects over
    a TCP connection.  It is used in conjunction with\nprotocols based on the offer/answer
    model, such as the Session\nInitiation Protocol (SIP).  TOTE can be used for any
    application\nrequiring direct agent-to-agent data communication, such as picture\nexchange
    or camera controls.\n\t </p>\n      "
