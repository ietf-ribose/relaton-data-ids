abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a framework for providing quantitative IP services
    with guaranteed QoS. Although the proposed reservation approach is based on a
    new, lightweight signaling protocol, it can be used with interoperability with
    other IP QoS techniques such as Diff-Serv, Int-Serv. Distinguishing features of
    the Boomerang protocol are: * signaling messages are generated only by the initiating
    node, therefore complexity and intelligence is concentrated in one point enabling
    simple implementation * flow state aggregation can be suggested to subsequent
    nodes by appending the Boomerang message, thus good scalability can be achieved
    * bi-directional reservation can be made independently of the path, which yields
    a fast and effective reservation process * the only requirement on the far-end
    node is that it should be able to bounce the Boomerang message back, ensuring
    quick penetration into the current Internet. There is a lab prototype in which
    the Boomerang protocol is wrapped in ICMP ECHO / ECHO-REPLY (PING) messages.</p>"
