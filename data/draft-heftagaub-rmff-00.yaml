abstract:
- content: "<p>The RealMedia File Format (RMFF) is designed to be a generic container
    for streaming media data. This data may then be played back locally or streamed
    over a network using protocols such as RTSP and RTP. The format is data-independent,
    allowing any data type to be recorded, manipulated and played back. Note: This
    document is intended to be informational in nature of what the file format in
    use by RealNetworks' RealServer and RealPlayer implementations. Though we think
    that there are a lot of important concepts embodied in this specification, and
    that it may even make the basis of a ''standard'' file format, this is intended
    to eventually end up as an Informational RFC.</p>"
