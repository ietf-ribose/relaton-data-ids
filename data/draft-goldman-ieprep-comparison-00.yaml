abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This document provides a high level conceptual discussion on thesignificant
    modeling differences affecting the treatment of a POTS(Plain Old Telephone Service)
    call, a GETS (Government EmergencyTelephone Service) call, and an MLPP (Multilevel
    Priority andPreemption) call in the traditional voice PSTN (Public SwitchedTelephone
    Network).The genesis for this discussion on these services is primarily fromexperience
    with the United States capabilities and it is appreciatedthat these types of calls
    may be very different or non-existent inother regions of the world. Still, it
    may be useful to provide thisdiscussion as a background, which may be useful in
    understanding thelegacy operations as the chartered ieprep work progresses.It
    should be made clear from the onset that this document suggests norequirements
    or solutions, but is merely informative about thetradition voice network treatments.</p>"
