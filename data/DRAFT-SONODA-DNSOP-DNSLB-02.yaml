abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a new DNS load balance function that
    is able to\n   transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing.\n
    \  DNS base load balance is popular technology.  It provides weight base\n   response
    and location base response.  It have become an indispensable\n   part of traffic
    engineering.  However, DNS base load balance can't\n   transfer load balance information
    in zone transfer and need online\n   singing because it is not standardized.  This
    document defines a new\n   DNS resource record called \"LB\" and new EDNS option
    bit called \"LS\".\n   LB RR provides the balancing information weight, location
    and target\n   domain name.  LS bit provides the change response mechanism in
    name\n   servers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
