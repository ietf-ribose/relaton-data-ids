abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Modern data center networks face a number of scale challenges.
    \ One\nsuch challenge for so-called \"massive\" data center networks is\naddress
    resolution, such as is provided by ARP and/or ND.  This\ndocument describes the
    problem of address resolution in massive data\ncenters.  It discusses the network
    impact of various data center\ntechnologies including server virtualization, illustrates
    reasons\nwhy it is still desirable to have multiple hosts on the same Layer 2\ndata
    center network, and describes potential address resolution\nproblems this type
    of Layer 2 network will face.\n\t </p>\n      "
