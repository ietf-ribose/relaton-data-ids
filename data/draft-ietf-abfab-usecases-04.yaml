abstract:
- content: "<p>Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services
    at present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web- based
    contexts. The goal of this document is to document a selection of the wide variety
    of these contexts whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies
    based on the ABFAB architecture and specifications.</p>"
