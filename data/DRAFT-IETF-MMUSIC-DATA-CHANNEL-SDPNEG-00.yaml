abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working
    group is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n
    \  communications using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.
    \ For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular
    defined the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each
    data channel might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.
    \ Data channel setup\n   can be done using either the internal in-band band (also
    referred to\n   as 'internal' for the rest of the document) WebRTC Data Channel\n
    \  Establishment Protocol or some external out-of-band simply referred\n   to
    as 'external negotiation' in the rest of the document . This\n   document specifies
    how the SDP offer/answer exchange can be used to\n   achieve such an external
    negotiation.  Even though data channels are\n   designed for RTCWeb use initially
    they may be used by other protocols\n   like, but not limited to, the CLUE protocol.
    \ This document is\n   intended to be used wherever data channels are used.\n\n\t
