abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The IAB has published RFC7624 in response to several revelations
    of\n   pervasive attack on Internet communications.  This document considers\n
    \  the implications of protocol designs which associate metadata with\n   encrypted
    flows.  In particular, it asserts that designs which do so\n   by explicit actions
    at the host are preferable to designs in which\n   middleboxes insert them.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
