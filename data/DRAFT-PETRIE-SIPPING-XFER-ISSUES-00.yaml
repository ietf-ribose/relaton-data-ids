abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>Transfer features in SIP have been enabled via the REFER method
    \ and\nReplaces header.  These constructs have been around for a while now\nwith
    stable definitions for how they work.  However, there appear to\nbe a small set
    of edge cases and requirements that are not yet\nsatisfied.  This draft attempts
    to define some of those cases and\nrequirements.  This is intended to spark discussion
    to whether these\nare legitimate requirements on which further standards work
    is\nappropriate.\n\t </p>\n      "
