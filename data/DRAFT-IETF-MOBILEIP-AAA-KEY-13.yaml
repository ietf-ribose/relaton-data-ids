abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the\nInternet
    today to provide authentication and authorization services\nfor dial-up computers.
    \ Mobile IP requires strong authentication\nbetween the mobile node and its home
    agent.  When the mobile node\nshares a AAA security association with its home
    AAA server, however,\nit is possible to use that security association to create
    derived\nmobility security associations between the mobile node and its home\nagent,
    and again between the mobile node and the foreign agent\ncurrently offering connectivity
    to the mobile node.  This document\nspecifies extensions to Mobile IP registration
    messages that can be\nused to create mobility security associations between the
    mobile node\nand its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign\nagent.\n\t
