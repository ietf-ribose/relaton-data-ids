abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>\n   Implementing the so called identifier / locator separation
    may have\n   far-reaching consequences to the Internet architecture, depending\n
    \  very much on how exactly it is implemented.  That is, here as in many\n   other
    cases, the devil lies very much in the details.\n\n   In this document, we attempt
    to outline the various aspects of the\n   design space.  We briefly discuss six
    main aspects: identifiers,\n   dynamic traffic management, end-to-end issues,
    security, economics,\n   and deployment.  In this initial version of the document,
    we still\n   lack many details.\n\n   This document is a reaction to the problem
    statement effort at the\n   Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS).\n\n\t
