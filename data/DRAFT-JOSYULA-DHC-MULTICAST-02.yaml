abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating\n
    \  transmission of television channels as multicast streams use\n   dedicated
    multicast group addresses in IP networks.  Internet Group\n   Multicast Protocol(IGMP)
    is widely used for the communication between\n   hosts and routers to deliver
    the multicast streams in the IPv4\n   networks.  Similarly,Multicast Listener
    Discovery Protocol (MLD)is\n   used for the communication between the hosts and
    routers to deliver\n   the multicast streams in the IPv6 networks.  It is also
    possible for\n   the networks to distinguish these multicast streams not only
    by their\n   destination multicast group but also by the source IP address of
    the\n   streams.  IGMP version-3 and MLD version-2 are protocols that allow\n
    \  the hosts to inform the neighboring routers about their desire to\n   receive
    the multicast streams from specific source IP addresses.\n   This needs a mechanism
    to supply the available multicast source\n   address information to the hosts
    and the hosts also should be\n   strictly implemented with the source specific
    multicasting aware\n   protocols such as above mentioned IGMPv3 or MLDv2.  This
    document\n   describes a new DHCP option which can addresses these issues.  In\n
    \  addition to this, the document also describes about the advantages in\n   the
    networks by implementing this option.\n\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
