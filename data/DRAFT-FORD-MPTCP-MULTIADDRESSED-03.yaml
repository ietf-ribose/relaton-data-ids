abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path
    per\nconnection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\nsimultaneous
    use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would\nimprove resource usage
    within the network, and thus improve user\nexperience through higher throughput
    and improved resilience to\nnetwork failure.\n\nMultipath TCP provides the ability
    to simultaneously use multiple\npaths between peers.  This document presents a
    set of extensions to\ntraditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol
    offers\nthe same type of service to applications as TCP - reliable bytestream\n-
    and provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple\nTCP flows
    across potentially disjoint paths.\n\t </p>\n      "
