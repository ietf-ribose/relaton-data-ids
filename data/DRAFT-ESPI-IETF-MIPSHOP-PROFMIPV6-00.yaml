abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol was developed\nfrom
    the experience of MIPv6 and the facilities provided by link\nlayer triggers, allowing
    for a proactive approach to handover that\nminimises packet exchange delay and
    packet loss.  On completion of\nhandover, the mobile node engages MIPv6 procedures
    in to update the\nHome Agent with the mobile node's new location.  Subsequently,
    the\nmobile node may carry out Return Routability with the correspondent\nnode(s)
    for route optimization.  However, this method leaves scope to\noptimize handover
    delays derived from the signalling message\nexchange.\n\nThis document proposes
    an enhancement to FMIPv6, the Proactive Route\nOptimization for FMIPv6 (PRO-FMIPv6)
    protocol, which aims to further\nreduce the signalling load thereby improving
    the overall performance\nof the handover process.\n\t </p>\n      "
