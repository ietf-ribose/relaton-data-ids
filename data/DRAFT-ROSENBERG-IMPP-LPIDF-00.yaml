abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document describes a data format, the Lightweight Presence\nInformation
    Data Format (LPIDF) for conveying presence information.\nThe format is based on
    RFC822 encoding of presence data. In fact,\nthis encoding is exactly identical
    to the encoding used by the\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) in its registration
    messages. This\nsimplifies the process of parsing and processing presence data
    in\nclients which use SIP for presence or communications services. LPIDF\nis one
    instantiation of an abstract presence data model also\ndescribed here.\n\n\t </p>\n
