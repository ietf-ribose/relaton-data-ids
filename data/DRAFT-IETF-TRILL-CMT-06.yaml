abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL networks
    via\n   choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs.  Appointed\n   Forwarders
    provide load sharing based on VLAN with an\n   active-standby model. High performance
    applications require an\n   active-active load sharing model as discussed in RFC
    7379. The\n   Active-Active load-sharing model can be accomplished by\n   representing
    any given non-TRILL network with a single virtual\n   RBridge. Virtual representation
    of the non-TRILL network with a\n   single RBridge poses serious challenges in
    multi-destination RPF\n   (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations.  This
    document\n   specifies required enhancements to build Coordinated Multicast\n
    \  Trees (CMT) within the TRILL campus to solve related RPF\n   issues. CMT provides
    flexibility to RBridges in selecting desired\n   path of association to a given
    TRILL multi-destination distribution\n   tree.  This document updates RFC 6325.\n\n\t
