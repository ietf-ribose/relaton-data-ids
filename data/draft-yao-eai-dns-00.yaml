abstract:
- content: "<p>Key RFCs for internationalized email addresses specify the basic protocols
    for using them. The SMTP client can only know the SMTP server's ability by EHLO
    command. In order to help the internationalized email address delivery, this document
    suggests to add the new DNS RR type for internationalized email protocols. Through
    this RR type, the SMTP client can know whether the destination SMTP server can
    support the SMTPUTF8 ability before sending the EHLO command to the server.</p>"
