abstract:
  content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such aspieces
    of information or server processes, which are available inseveral equivalent replicas
    on different hosts. This includes, butis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing
    applications. The goalof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provideguidance
    to these applications, which have to select one or severalhosts from a set of
    candidates, that are able to provide a desiredresource. The protocol is under
    specification in the ALTO workinggroup. This memo discusses deployment related
    issues of ALTO forpeer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary security considerations,
    andalso initial guidance for application designers using ALTO.</p>"
