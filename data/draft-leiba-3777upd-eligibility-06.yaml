abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may not
    volunteer to serve on the nominating committee". Since the time that document
    was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) was formed; that
    body is not covered by RFC 3777. There is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about whether
    ex officio members and liaisons are included as "sitting members". This document
    updates RFC 3777 to clarify the rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the
    IESG, and the IAOC. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>
