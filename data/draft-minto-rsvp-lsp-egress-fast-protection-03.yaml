abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC4090 defines a fast reroute mechanism for locally repairing an RSVP-TE
    LSP in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a downstream link or
    node failure. However, this mechanism does not provide node protection for LSP
    egress nodes, even when an alternate egress node (a backup egress) is available
    that could carry the traffic to its ultimate destination. This document addresses
    this scenario and describes how to provide egress protection by establishing a
    bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of a LSP to the backup egress node. The
    methods described in this document enable local repair in the order of 10s of
    milliseconds, in the event of the egress node failure. These methods are only
    applicable if traffic carried by the LSP can be rerouted to its ultimate destination
    by the backup egress node.</p>"
