abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Constrained IoT devices often operate more efficiently in a
    loosely\n   coupled environment without maintaining end-to-end connectivity\n
    \  between nodes.  Information Centric Networking naturally supports\n   this
    demand by replicated data distribution and hop wise forwarding.\n   This document
    outlines a deployment option for NDN in low-power and\n   lossy networks (LLNs)
    that follows a publish-subscribe pattern.  The\n   proposed protocol scheme simplifies
    name-based routing significantly\n   and facilitates even large off-duty cycles
    for constrained nodes.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
