abstract:
  content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computationfunctions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol LabelSwitching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks.An important application of MPLS and GMPLS networks is VirtualPrivate
    Networks (VPNs) that may be constructed using Label SwitchedPaths (LSPs) in the
    MPLS and GMPLS networks as VPN tunnels. PCE maybe applied as a tool to compute
    the paths of such tunnels in order toachieve better use of the network resources
    and to provide betterlevels of service to the VPN customers.Generic requirements
    for a communication protocol between PathComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are
    presented in "PathComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol GenericRequirements".
    This document complements the generic requirements andpresents a detailed set
    of PCC-PCE communication protocolrequirements that are specific to the application
    of PCE to VPNs.</p>
