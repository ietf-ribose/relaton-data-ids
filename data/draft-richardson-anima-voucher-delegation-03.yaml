abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of the RFC8366 Voucher Artifact
    in order to support delegation of signing authority. The initial voucher pins
    a public identity, and that public indentity can then issue additional vouchers.
    This chain of authorization can support permission-less resale of devices, as
    well as guarding against business failure of the BRSKI [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
    Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).</p>"
