abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   [RFC2918] defines a route refresh capability to be exchanged
    between\n   BGP speakers.  BGP speakers that support this capability are\n   advertising
    that they can resend the entire BGP Adj-RIB-Out on\n   receipt of a refresh request.
    \ By supporting this capability, BGP\n   speakers are more flexible in applying
    any inbound routing policy\n   changes as they no longer have to store received
    routes in their\n   unchanged form or reset the session when an inbound routing
    policy\n   change occurs.  The route refresh capability is advertised per AFI,\n
    \  SAFI combination.\n\n   There are newer AFI, SAFI types that have been introduced
    to BGP that\n   support a variety of route types (e.g.  IPv4/MVPN, L2VPN/EVPN).\n
    \  Currently, there is no way to request a subset of routes in a Route\n   Refresh
    message for a given AFI, SAFI.  This draft defines route\n   refresh capability
    extensions that help BGP speakers to request a\n   subset of routes for a given
    address family.  This is expected to\n   reduce the amount of update traffic being
    generated by route refresh\n   requests as well as lessen the burden on the router
    servicing such\n   requests.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
