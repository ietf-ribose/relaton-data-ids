abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   PCE as a central controller specifies the procedures and PCEP\n
    \  protocol extensions where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and\n   label
    forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized PCE\n   server to each
    network devices along the LSP path while leveraging\n   the existing PCE technologies
    as much as possible.\n\n   Labels downloaded to forwarding entries requires a
    reliable\n   synchronization mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs)\n
    \  and the PCE.  The basic mechanism for label database (LABEL-DB\n   synchronization
    is part of the PCE as a central controller\n   specification.  This document presents
    motivations for optimizations\n   to the LABEL-DB synchronization and the corresponding
    PCEP procedures\n   and extensions.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
