abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This draft proposes a scheme to increase the capacity of low-speedtransmission
    links, T-1/E-1 or smaller, to transport low-bit ratevoice applications over PPP.
    Given the relatively small payload sizeof the voice packets (average of 8 bytes
    for certain cellularnetworks) protocol overheads due to PPP, IP, UDP, and RTP
    aresignificant in determining the link capacity. The scheme proposedhere is to
    multiplex compressed RTP/UDP packets into a single PPPframe. As a result, the
    PPP overhead (5-7 bytes) is distributed overmultiple compressed RTP/UDP packets.</p>"
