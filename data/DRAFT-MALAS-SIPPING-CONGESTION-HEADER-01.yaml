abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines a new header field for use with SIP.  The
    \nCONGESTION header field is used to report insufficient resources to an \nupstream
    element.  It provides a means for passing the congestion \ninformation, but does
    not dictate how the receiver of the information \nshould react to the information.
    \ This header is intended to provide a \nmechanism for decreasing the dependence
    on the 503 response code for \ndetermining an overloaded state.  In addition,
    it provides detailed \ncongestion awareness functionality, to compensate for current
    limited \ncapabilities in SIP.  This functionality can provide specific \ninformation
    regarding the cause of the congestion for custom \naplication treatment policies.
    \ \n\n\t </p>\n      "
