abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the Forwarding
    and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol to control the Forwarding Element
    Manager (FEM) by creating a Logical Functional Block (LFB) to represent its functionality,
    the FE Configuration (FEC) LFB . A Control Element (CE) that controls a Forwarding
    Element's (FE) resources can also manage its configuration via the FEC LFB. On
    a running FE, the CE may update the FE's runtime configuration via an FEC LFB
    e.g., by adding a new CE and its associated IP address). Additionally, in the
    case where we have a resource pool of FEs, the FEC may be used to initiate an
    FE into the Network Element cluster. This document introduces the FEC LFB, an
    LFB that specifies the configuration parameters of an FE.</p>"
