abstract:
  content: "\t <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new
    RTCPXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding mediatransmission
    or reception quality, as proposed indraft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in progress
    [replace with RFCnumber]). This memo suggests that a new block should contain
    asingle metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a singleparameter of interest
    or concern, rather than containing a number ofmetrics which attempt to provide
    full coverage of all thoseparameters of concern to a specific application. Applications
    maythen \"mix and match\" to create a set of blocks which covers their setof concerns.
    Where possible, a specific block should be designed tobe re-usable across more
    than one application, for example, for allof voice, streaming audio and video.</p>"
