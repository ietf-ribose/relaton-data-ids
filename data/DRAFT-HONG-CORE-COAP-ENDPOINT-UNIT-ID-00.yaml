abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol intended\n
    \  towards devices which are constrained in terms of memory, processing\n   and
    power i.e. small low power sensors, switches and valves etc.  The\n   CoAP allows
    such devices to interactively communicate over the\n   Internet.  This document
    is motivated by the concept of a composite\n   CoAP node, a single CoAP entity
    which integrates multiple CoAP\n   resources (sensors, actuators) and the scheme
    to allow the\n   identification of individual integrated resources while using
    the\n   Unit ID as a new CoAP option.  The Unit ID option in the CoAP enables\n
    \  the usage of composite nodes consisting of multiple sensors and\n   actuators
    while having a single IP address for communication.  The\n   integrated resources
    can be individually or collectively communicated\n   with and/or controlled using
    CoAP messages with additional options of\n   UnitSize and UnitID.  The UnitSize
    is basically a numeric value\n   indicating the number of sub-resources in a composite
    CoAP node while\n   the UnitID option has the string identifiers for the sub-resource(s)\n
    \  for which the message is intended.  These options will enable the\n   CoAP
    to communicate and control multiple resources by using single\n   composite messages
    i.e.  UnitID = \"*\", efficiently utilize IP\n   addresses i.e. one IP multiple
    IDs, reduce communication traffic and\n   hence conserve power among the CoAP
    resources.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
