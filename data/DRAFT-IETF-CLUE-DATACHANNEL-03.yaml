abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism,\n
    \  together with the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) and the\n   SDP-based
    \"SCTP over DTLS\" data channel negotiation mechanism, in\n   order to establish
    a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data Channel,\n   for transporting CLUE protocol
    messages between two CLUE entities.\n\n   The document defines the SCTP considerations
    specific to a CLUE Data\n   Channel, the SDP Media Description- and SDP dcmap
    attribute values,\n   and the DCEP procedures for opening, a CLUE Data Channel.\n\n
    \  Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP\n   Offer/Answer
    procedures for negotiating a CLUE data channel, are\n   outside the scope of this
    document.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
