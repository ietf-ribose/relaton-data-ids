abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being\n
    \  considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the\n   networking
    industry at large.  Many standards organizations and open\n   source projects
    are using YANG to develop and publish models of\n   configuration, state data
    and operations for a wide variety of\n   networking applications.  At the same
    time, there is currently no\n   well-known terminology to categorize the various
    types of YANG models\n   that are being worked on.\n\n   A consistent terminology
    would help with the categorization of\n   models, assist in the analysis the YANG
    data modeling efforts in the\n   IETF and in other places, and bring clarity to
    the YANG-related\n   discussions between the different groups.\n\n   This document
    describes a set of concepts and associated terms to\n   support consistent classification
    of YANG models.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
