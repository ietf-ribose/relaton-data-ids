abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   The temporary addresses described by RFC4941 makes it more
    difficult\n   for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to track the
    \n   hosts,and it is necessary to the home networks,but in the enterprise \n   networks,
    it is not necessary, and some network administrators want \n   to disable the
    temporary addresses. This document tries to provide a\n   solution to these network
    administrators,and they can specify whether\n   the prefixes can be used to generate
    the temporary addresses.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
