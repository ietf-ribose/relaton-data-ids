  content: "\n\t <p>   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism\n
    \  enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event\n   streams
    with various different period intervals to report updates.\n   Applying these
    elements allows servers automatically adjust the\n   volume of telemetry traffic
    and rate of traffic sent from publisher\n   to the receivers.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
