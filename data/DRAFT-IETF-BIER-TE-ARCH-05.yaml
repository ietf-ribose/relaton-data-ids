abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose
    path\n   engineered replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit\n   Replication
    packets ([RFC8279]).  This is called BIER-TE.\n\n   BIER-TE leverages the BIER
    architecture ([RFC8279]) and extends it\n   with a new semantic for bits in the
    bitstring.  BIER-TE can leverage\n   BIER forwarding engines with little or no
    changes.\n\n   In BIER, the BitPositions (BP) of the packets bitstring indicate
    BIER\n   Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER), and hop-by-hop forwarding uses a\n
    \  Routing Underlay such as an IGP.\n\n   In BIER-TE, BitPositions indicate adjacencies.
    \ The BIFT of each BFR\n   are only populated with BPs that are adjacent to the
    BFR in the BIER-\n   TE topology.  The BIER-TE topology can consist of layer 2
    or remote\n   (route) adjacencies.  The BFR then replicates and forwards BIER\n
    \  packets to those adjacencies.  This results in the aforementioned\n   strict
    and loose path forwarding.\n\n   BIER-TE can co-exist with BIER forwarding in
    the same domain, for\n   example by using separate sub-domains.  In the absence
    of routed\n   adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay, and\n
    \  can then be operated without requiring an IGP routing protocol.\n\n   BIER-TE
    operates without explicit in-network tree-building and\n   carries the multicast
    distribution tree in the packet header.  It can\n   therefore be a good fit to
    support multicast path steering in Segment\n   Routing (SR) networks.\n\n\t </p>\n
