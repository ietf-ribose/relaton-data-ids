abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This Internet draft investigates the management aspects associated\nwith
    packet-based distribution of time and frequency using protocols\nsuch as PTP (Precision
    Time Protocol, [1]).  It explores some of the\nissues that need to be solved in
    connection with the management of\nsynchronization distribution.\n\t </p>\n      "
