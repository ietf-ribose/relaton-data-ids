abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes that the headers of REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE be combined,
    so that a REGISTER message can also be treated as an implicit subscription for
    events. This memo identifies the need for doing this, and then explains how combining
    the Registration and Subscription solves the problem. It also presents an example
    flow demonstrating the use of this combined registration and subscription. The
    headers being combined will be made optional in the REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE messages
    - depending on where they do not appear as of today - so that backward compatibility
    is maintained.</p>"
