abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping of addresses to names has been a feature of DNS. Many sites,
    implement it, many others don't. Some applications attempt to use it as a part
    of a security strategy. The goal of this document is to encourage proper deployment
    of address to name mappings, and provide guidance for their use.</p>"
