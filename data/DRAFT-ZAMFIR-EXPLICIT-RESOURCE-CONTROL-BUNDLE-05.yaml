abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been
    used \n   extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are \n
    \  bundled, identification of label resource in RRO is not enough for \n   the
    administrative purpose. Network service providers would like to \n   know the
    component link within a TE link that is being used by a\n   given LSP. In other
    words, when link bundling is used, resource \n   recording requires mechanisms
    to specify the component link \n   identifier, along with the TE link identifier
    and Label. As , it is \n   not possible to record component link in the RRO, this
    draft defines \n   the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify
    \n   component link identifiers for resource recording purposes.  \n    \n   This
    draft also defines the ERO counterpart of the RRO extension. The \n   ERO extensions
    are needed to perform explicit label/ resource control \n   over bundled TE link.
    Hence, this draft defines the extensions to \n   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473]
    to specify component link identifiers \n   for explicit resource control and recording
    over GMPLS link bundles.  \n\t </p>\n      "
