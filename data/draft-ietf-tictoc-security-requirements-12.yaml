abstract:
- content: "<p>As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming increasingly
    common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security threats
    is increasing. This document defines a set of security requirements for time protocols,
    focusing on the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
    This document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol practices,
    the performance implications of external security practices on time protocols,
    and the dependencies between other security services and time synchronization.</p>"
