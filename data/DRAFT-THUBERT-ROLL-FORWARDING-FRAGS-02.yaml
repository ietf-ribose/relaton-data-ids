abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled
    at\n   every hop of a multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs.\n
    \  Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an\n   802.15.4
    frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst\n   case, a packet might
    end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments\n   at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.
    \ If a single one of those fragments is\n   lost in transmission, all fragments
    must be resent, further\n   contributing to the congestion that might have caused
    the initial\n   packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward
    and\n   recover individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops\n   between
    6LoWPAN endpoints.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
