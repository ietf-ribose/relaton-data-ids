abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate
    a point\n   of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain\n
    \  consensus within the group.  These methods include: writing an\n   Internet
    Draft, discussion on email lists, discussion at face-to-\n   face, interim or
    virtual meetings, and design teams.  At times, these\n   methods fall short.  People
    become entrenched in their positions.  A\n   Working Group may be split for a
    prolonged period wasting time and\n   energy.  There may be a lasting impact.
    \ While the authors support\n   rough consensus, the collateral damage of this
    process, at times can\n   be considerable.  This document discusses the benefits
    and drawbacks\n   of each of the current methods of communication focusing solely
    on\n   their efficacy at conflict resolution.   A companion document will\n   propose
    some solutions including alternative methods of conflict\n   resolution.\n\n\t
