abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery
    (RELOAD),\n   a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.
    \ A\n   P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage\n
    \  and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form\n   the
    overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session\n   Initiation Protocol
    (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other\n   applications with similar requirements
    by defining new usages that\n   specify the kinds of data that must be stored
    for a particular\n   application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a
    certificate\n   enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal
    is\n   a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access\n   from
    \"client\" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data\n   for others.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
