abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
    to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks). Recent
    research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly
    differ from the IETF's congestion control principles. Using these new congestion
    control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the
    traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized
    congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing
    with alternate congestion control proposals. The goal of this document is to provide
    guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
