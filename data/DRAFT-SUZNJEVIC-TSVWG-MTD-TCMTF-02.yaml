abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document contains recommendations to be taken into account
    when\n   using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through\n   compression,
    multiplexing, and tunneling traffic flows (TCM-TF) over\n   a network path.  Different
    multiplexing policies and implementation\n   issues which are service and link
    specific are discussed.\n   Additionally, this document describes policies which
    can be used for\n   detecting, classifying, and choosing the network flows suitable
    for\n   optimization by using TCM-TF.  Finally, recommendations of maximum\n   tolerable
    delays to be added by optimization techniques are reported.\n   Recommendations
    are presented only for network services for which\n   such bandwidth optimization
    techniques are applicable (i.e., services\n   with low payload to header size
    ratio, which will also be denoted as\n   \"small-packet flows\").\n\n\t </p>\n
