abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft introduces filter rules as a means for a multi-homed
    node\n   to perform per flow interface selection.  Per flow interface\n   selection
    is typically needed when there exist multiple network\n   interfaces, each with
    different network characteristics, and an\n   application has specific performance
    requirements for a data flow\n   that makes one network interface more suitable
    than another.  The use\n   of OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF) syntax is proposed to
    describe the\n   filter rules.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
