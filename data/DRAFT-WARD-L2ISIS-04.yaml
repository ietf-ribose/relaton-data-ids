abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This draft specifies the IS-IS extensions necessary to support
    multi-\nlink IPv4 and IPv6 networks, as well as to provide true link state\nrouting
    to any protocols running directly over layer 2.  While\nsupporting this concept
    involves several pieces, this document only\ndescribes extensions to IS-IS.  We
    leave it to the systems using\nthese IS-IS extensions to explain how the information
    carried in\nIS-IS is used.1.  Overview\n\nThere are a number of systems (for example,
    [RBRIDGES]) which have\nproposed using layer 2 addresses carried in a link state
    routing\nprotocol, specifically IS-IS [IS-IS] [RFC1195], to provide true layer\n2
    routing in specific environments.  This draft proposes a set of\nTLVs and sub-TLVs
    to be added to [IS-IS] level 1 PDUs, and three new\nPDU types, to support these
    proposed systems.\n\nThis draft does not propose new forwarding mechanisms using
    this\nadditional information carried within IS-IS.  There is a short\nsection
    included on two possible ways to build a shortest path first\ntree including this
    information, to illustrate how this information\nmight be used.\n\t </p>\n      "
