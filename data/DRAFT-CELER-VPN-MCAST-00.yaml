abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>  This draft introduces an interworking function between shared
    backbone\nmulticast domain and VPN multicast domain. The architecture that \nfollows
    is similar to Multicast Border Router functionality, however the\nmapping is defined
    not as a mapping between two different multicast \nprotocols, but two different
    multicast topologies the under assumption \nthat the shared backbone multicast
    topology will be shared between VPNs \nfor carrying the traffic. The main assumption
    made in this draft is that \nmulticast packets are replicated on PE device (router)
    for scalability \nand performance reasons.  However, it is possible to extend
    the solution\nand replicate packets on CE devices. The proposed mapping of addresses
    \nto topology solves the issue of scalability of multicast addresses to \nstate
    knowledge in the core.  This draft also identifies three types of\nmulticast capabilities
    for the core. \n\n\t </p>\n      "
