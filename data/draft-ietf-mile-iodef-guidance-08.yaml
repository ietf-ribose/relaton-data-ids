abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2 [RFC7970] defines
    a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly
    exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
    security incidents. Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options
    that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging
    for security practitioners to develop tools that can leverage IODEF for incident
    sharing. This document provides guidelines for IODEF practitioners. It also addresses
    how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how
    IODEF is being. The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors
    easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by Computer Security
    Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.</p>"
