abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional mail system handles only US-ASCII characters in SMTP envelope
    and mail headers. The Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) is implemented by
    allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. To deliver IMA through
    IMA incompliant environment, some sort of converting mechanism (i.e. downgrading)
    is required. This document describes requirements for downgrading, SMTP session
    downgrade, header downgrade and implementation consideration.</p>"
