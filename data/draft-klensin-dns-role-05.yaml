abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the original function and purpose of the domain
    name system (DNS). It contrasts that history with some of the purposes for which
    the DNS has recently been applied and some of the newer demands being placed upon
    it or suggested for it. A framework for an alternative to placing these additional
    stresses on the DNS is then outlined. This document and that framework are not
    a proposed solution, only a strong suggestion that the time has come to begin
    thinking more broadly about the problems we are encountering and possible approaches
    to solving them. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
