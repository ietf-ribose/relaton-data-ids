abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent\n
    \  Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid'\n   namespace
    identifier.  The purpose of the standard is to support\n   general, global, sustainable,
    humanly readable, technology agnostic,\n   persistent and precise web references
    for web materials.\n\n   The PWID URN can assist in two ways: First, by providing
    potential\n   resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for documents,\n
    \  which is not sufficiently covered by existing web reference\n   practices.
    \ Second, by providing a standardized way to specify web\n   elements in a web
    collection also known as web corpus.  Definitions\n   of web collections are often
    needed for extraction of data used in\n   production of research results, e.g.
    for evaluations in the future.\n   Current practices today are not persistent
    as they often use some CDX\n   version, which vary for different implementations.\n\n\t
