abstract:
- content: "<p>As modern network management applications grow in scale and complexity,
    their demands and requirements on the supporting communication network increase.
    This is the root cause of one of the major challenges that network operators (service
    providers, SME, etc) are facing today. The operators are obliged to create a simplified
    view of their network infrastructure that can help network engineers to use such
    a simplified model rather than manipulating individual devices. In this context,
    providing network operators with a set of standard interfaces to configure and
    set policies at various points on their network is essential. This document describes
    what has to be addressed in order to equip service providers with the means to
    quickly and dynamically create/query/scale/update/ delete/ the services they want
    to offer. This may include a variety of different service enabling scenarios and
    in particular VPN and Inter-DC traffic steering and tunneling.</p>"
