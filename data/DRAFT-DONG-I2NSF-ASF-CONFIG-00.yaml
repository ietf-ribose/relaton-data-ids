abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   This draft defines a network security function (NSF-) facing\n
    \  interface of the security controller for the purpose of configuring\n   some
    advanced security functions.  These advanced security functions\n   include antivirus,
    anti-ddos, and intrusion prevention system (IPS).\n   The interface is presented
    in a YANG data model fashion and can be\n   used to deploy a large amount of NSF
    blocks that all support above\n   mentioned functions in the software defined
    network (SDN) based\n   paradigm.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
