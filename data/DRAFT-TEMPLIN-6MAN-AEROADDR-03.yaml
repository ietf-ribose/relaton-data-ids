abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that
    is\n   unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address\n   through
    the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\n   and employ Duplicate
    Address Detection (DAD) to ensure uniqueness.\n   This document presents a method
    for a node that obtains a delegated\n   prefix to statelessly construct a link-local
    address (known as the\n   \"AERO address\") that is assured to be unique on the
    link.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
