abstract:
- content: "<p>Key to the extensibility of the Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) protocol has been the handling of unsupported and/or invalid Type/Length/Value
    (TLV) tuples. Although there are explicit statements in existing specifications,
    deployment experience has shown that there are inconsistencies in the behavior
    when a TLV which is disallowed in a particular Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is received.
    This document discusses such cases and makes the correct behavior explicit in
    order to insure that interoperability is maximized. This document when approved
    updates RFC3563, RFC5305, RFC6232, and RFC6233.</p>"
