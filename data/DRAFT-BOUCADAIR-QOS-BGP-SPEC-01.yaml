abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This  memo  describes  a  proposal  for  exchanging  QoS-enabled
    \n   reachability information between service providers. It defines new \n   BGP
    attributes to be used in order to convey QoS performance \n   characteristics
    between service providers and it describes how to use \n   these QoS values in
    order to select the best path. An example of \n   route selection process that
    takes into account the QoS performance \n   values enclosed in BGP messages is
    also detailed.\n\t </p>\n      "
